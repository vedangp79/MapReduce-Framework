Happy	1
families	1
are	1
all	1
alike	1
every	1
unhappy	1
family	1
is	1
unhappy	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
way	1
Everything	1
was	1
in	1
confusion	1
in	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
house	1
The	1
wife	1
had	1
discovered	1
that	1
the	1
husband	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
an	1
intrigue	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
governess	1
in	1
their	1
family	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
announced	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
him	1
This	1
position	1
of	1
affairs	1
had	1
now	1
lasted	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
themselves	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
and	1
household	1
were	1
painfully	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
Every	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sense	1
in	1
their	1
living	1
together	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
stray	1
people	1
brought	1
together	1
by	1
chance	1
in	1
any	1
inn	1
had	1
more	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
than	1
they	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
household	1
of	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
The	1
wife	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
home	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
The	1
children	1
ran	1
wild	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
quarreled	1
with	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
wrote	1
to	1
a	1
friend	1
asking	1
her	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
new	1
situation	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
man	1
cook	1
had	1
walked	1
off	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
just	1
at	1
dinner	1
time	1
the	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
given	1
warning	1
Three	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
quarrel	1
Prince	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Oblonsky	1
Stiva	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world	1
woke	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
usual	1
hour	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
bedroom	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
leather	1
covered	1
sofa	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
He	1
turned	1
over	1
his	1
stout	1
well	1
cared	1
for	1
person	1
on	1
the	1
springy	1
sofa	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
sink	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
sleep	1
again	1
he	1
vigorously	1
embraced	1
the	1
pillow	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
buried	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
Yes	1
yes	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
now	1
he	1
thought	1
going	1
over	1
his	1
dream	1
Now	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
Alabin	1
was	1
giving	1
a	1
dinner	1
at	1
Darmstadt	1
no	1
not	1
Darmstadt	1
but	1
something	1
American	1
Yes	1
but	1
then	1
Darmstadt	1
was	1
in	1
America	1
Yes	1
Alabin	1
was	1
giving	1
a	1
dinner	1
on	1
glass	1
tables	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
sang	1
Il	1
mio	1
tesoro	1
not	1
Il	1
mio	1
tesoro	1
though	1
but	1
something	1
better	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
little	1
decanters	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
women	1
too	1
he	1
remembered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
twinkled	1
gaily	1
and	1
he	1
pondered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
nice	1
very	1
nice	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
that	1
was	1
delightful	1
only	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
words	1
or	1
even	1
expressing	1
it	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
thoughts	1
awake	1
And	1
noticing	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
light	1
peeping	1
in	1
beside	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
serge	1
curtains	1
he	1
cheerfully	1
dropped	1
his	1
feet	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
felt	1
about	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
his	1
slippers	1
a	1
present	1
on	1
his	1
last	1
birthday	1
worked	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
gold	1
colored	1
morocco	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
nine	1
years	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
without	1
getting	1
up	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
always	1
hung	1
in	1
his	1
bedroom	1
And	1
thereupon	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
sleeping	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
room	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
why	1
the	1
smile	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows	1
Ah	1
ah	1
ah	1
Oo	1
he	1
muttered	1
recalling	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
And	1
again	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
quarrel	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
present	1
to	1
his	1
imagination	1
all	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
fault	1
Yes	1
she	1
won	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
and	1
she	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
And	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
thing	1
about	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
my	1
fault	1
all	1
my	1
fault	1
though	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
situation	1
he	1
reflected	1
Oh	1
oh	1
oh	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating	1
in	1
despair	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
acutely	1
painful	1
sensations	1
caused	1
him	1
by	1
this	1
quarrel	1
Most	1
unpleasant	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
when	1
on	1
coming	1
happy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
from	1
the	1
theater	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
pear	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
either	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
her	1
bedroom	1
with	1
the	1
unlucky	1
letter	1
that	1
revealed	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
She	1
his	1
Dolly	1
forever	1
fussing	1
and	1
worrying	1
over	1
household	1
details	1
and	1
limited	1
in	1
her	1
ideas	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
was	1
sitting	1
perfectly	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
horror	1
despair	1
and	1
indignation	1
What	1
s	1
this	1
this	1
she	1
asked	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
And	1
at	1
this	1
recollection	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
annoyed	1
at	1
the	1
fact	1
itself	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
words	1
There	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
what	1
does	1
happen	1
to	1
people	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
unexpectedly	1
caught	1
in	1
something	1
very	1
disgraceful	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
adapting	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
towards	1
his	1
wife	1
by	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
his	1
fault	1
Instead	1
of	1
being	1
hurt	1
denying	1
defending	1
himself	1
begging	1
forgiveness	1
instead	1
of	1
remaining	1
indifferent	1
even	1
anything	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
do	1
his	1
face	1
utterly	1
involuntarily	1
reflex	1
spinal	1
action	1
reflected	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
physiology	1
utterly	1
involuntarily	1
assumed	1
its	1
habitual	1
good	1
humored	1
and	1
therefore	1
idiotic	1
smile	1
This	1
idiotic	1
smile	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
himself	1
Catching	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
smile	1
Dolly	1
shuddered	1
as	1
though	1
at	1
physical	1
pain	1
broke	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
characteristic	1
heat	1
into	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
cruel	1
words	1
and	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Since	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
husband	1
It	1
s	1
that	1
idiotic	1
smile	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it	1
all	1
thought	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
What	1
s	1
to	1

done	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
despair	1
and	1
found	1
no	1
answer	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
a	1
truthful	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
himself	1
He	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
deceiving	1
himself	1
and	1
persuading	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
repented	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
this	1
date	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
a	1
handsome	1
susceptible	1
man	1
of	1
thirty	1
four	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
five	1
living	1
and	1
two	1
dead	1
children	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
year	1
younger	1
than	1
himself	1
All	1
he	1
repented	1
of	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
better	1
in	1
hiding	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
his	1
children	1
and	1
himself	1
Possibly	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
managed	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
sins	1
better	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
anticipated	1
that	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
clearly	1
thought	1
out	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
vaguely	1
conceived	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
must	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
suspected	1
him	1
of	1
being	1
unfaithful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
shut	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
He	1
had	1
even	1
supposed	1
that	1
she	1
a	1
worn	1
out	1
woman	1
no	1
longer	1
young	1
or	1
good	1
looking	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
remarkable	1
or	1
interesting	1
merely	1
a	1
good	1
mother	1
ought	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
fairness	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
indulgent	1
view	1
It	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
quite	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
oh	1
dear	1
oh	1
dear	1
awful	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
kept	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
And	1
how	1
well	1
things	1
were	1
going	1
up	1
till	1
now	1
how	1
well	1
we	1
got	1
on	1
She	1
was	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
children	1
I	1
never	1
interfered	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
anything	1
I	1
let	1
her	1
manage	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
liked	1
It	1
s	1
true	1
it	1
s	1
bad	1
her	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
governess	1
in	1
our	1
house	1
That	1
s	1
bad	1
There	1
s	1
something	1
common	1
vulgar	1
in	1
flirting	1
with	1
one	1
s	1
governess	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
governess	1
He	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
roguish	1
black	1
eyes	1
of	1
Mlle	1
Roland	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
I	1
kept	1
myself	1
in	1
hand	1
And	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
already	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
ill	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
so	1
Oh	1
oh	1
But	1
what	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
solution	1
but	1
that	1
universal	1
solution	1
which	1
life	1
gives	1
to	1
all	1
questions	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
and	1
insoluble	1
That	1
answer	1
is	1
one	1
must	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
needs	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
is	1
forget	1
oneself	1
To	1
forget	1
himself	1
in	1
sleep	1
was	1
impossible	1
now	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
nighttime	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
sung	1
by	1
the	1
decanter	1
women	1
so	1
he	1
must	1
forget	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
of	1
daily	1
life	1
Then	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
gray	1
dressing	1
gown	1
lined	1
with	1
blue	1
silk	1
tied	1
the	1
tassels	1
in	1
a	1
knot	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
of	1
air	1
into	1
his	1
broad	1
bare	1
chest	1
he	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
confident	1
step	1
turning	1
out	1
his	1
feet	1
that	1
carried	1
his	1
full	1
frame	1
so	1
easily	1
He	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
loudly	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
his	1
valet	1
Matvey	1
carrying	1
his	1
clothes	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
a	1
telegram	1
Matvey	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
barber	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
necessaries	1
for	1
shaving	1
Are	1
there	1
any	1
papers	1
from	1
the	1
office	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
taking	1
the	1
telegram	1
and	1
seating	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
replied	1
Matvey	1
glancing	1
with	1
inquiring	1
sympathy	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
smile	1
They	1
ve	1
sent	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
jobbers	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
he	1
merely	1
glanced	1
at	1
Matvey	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
In	1
the	1
glance	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1
one	1
another	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
asked	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
Matvey	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
jacket	1
pockets	1
thrust	1
out	1
one	1
leg	1
and	1
gazed	1
silently	1
good	1
humoredly	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
I	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
Sunday	1
and	1
till	1
then	1
not	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
or	1
themselves	1
for	1
nothing	1
he	1
said	1
He	1
had	1
obviously	1
prepared	1
the	1
sentence	1
beforehand	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
Matvey	1
wanted	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
joke	1
and	1
attract	1
attention	1
to	1
himself	1
Tearing	1
open	1
the	1
telegram	1
he	1
read	1
it	1
through	1
guessing	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
misspelt	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
are	1
in	1
telegrams	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
brightened	1
Matvey	1
my	1
sister	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
said	1
checking	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
the	1
sleek	1
plump	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
barber	1
cutting	1
a	1
pink	1
path	1
through	1
his	1
long	1
curly	1
whiskers	1
Thank	1
God	1
said	1
Matvey	1
showing	1
by	1
this	1
response	1
that	1
he	1
like	1
his	1
master	1
realized	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
arrival	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
the	1
sister	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
might	1
bring	1
about	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
between	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
Alone	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
inquired	1
Matvey	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
as	1
the	1
barber	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
his	1
upper	1
lip	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
one	1
finger	1
Matvey	1
nodded	1
at	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
Alone	1
Is	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
ready	1
upstairs	1
Inform	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
where	1
she	1
orders	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Matvey	1
repeated	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
doubt	1
Yes	1
inform	1
her	1
Here	1
take	1
the	1
telegram	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
tells	1
you	1
You	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
it	1
on	1
Matvey	1
understood	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
said	1
Yes	1
sir	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
already	1
washed	1
and	1
combed	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
dressed	1
when	1
Matvey	1
stepping	1
deliberately	1
in	1
his	1
creaky	1
boots	1
came	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
telegram	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
The	1
barber	1
had	1
gone	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
Let	1
him	1
do	1
that	1
is	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
likes	1
he	1
said	1
laughing	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets	1
he	1
watched	1
his	1
master	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
silent	1
a	1
minute	1
Then	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
and	1
rather	1
pitiful	1
smile	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
Eh	1
Matvey	1
he	1
said	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
sir	1
she	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
said	1
Matvey	1
Come	1
round	1
Yes	1
sir	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
Who	1
s	1
there	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
hearing	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
dress	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
It	1
s	1
I	1
said	1
a	1
firm	1
pleasant	1
woman	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
pockmarked	1
face	1
of	1
Matrona	1
Philimonovna	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
thrust	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
doorway	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
Matrona	1
queried	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Although	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
completely	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
as	1
regards	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
himself	1
almost	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
even	1
the	1
nurse	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
chief	1
ally	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
Well	1
what	1
now	1
he	1
asked	1
disconsolately	1
Go	1
to	1
her	1
sir	1
own	1
your	1
fault	1
again	1
Maybe	1
God	1
will	1
aid	1
you	1
She	1
is	1
suffering	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
sad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
besides	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
topsy	1
turvy	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
pity	1
sir	1
on	1
the	1
children	1
Beg	1
her	1
forgiveness	1
sir	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
One	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
consequences	1
But	1
she	1
won	1
t	1
see	1
me	1
You	1
do	1
your	1
part	1
God	1
is	1
merciful	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
sir	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
Come	1
that	1
ll	1
do	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
blushing	1
suddenly	1
Well	1
now	1
do	1
dress	1
me	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
Matvey	1
and	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
decisively	1
Matvey	1
was	1
already	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
shirt	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
s	1
collar	1
and	1
blowing	1
off	1
some	1
invisible	1
speck	1
he	1
slipped	1
it	1
with	1
obvious	1
pleasure	1
over	1
the	1
well	1
groomed	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
Chapter	1
3	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sprinkled	1
some	1
scent	1
on	1
himself	1
pulled	1
down	1
his	1
shirt	1
cuffs	1
distributed	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
his	1
cigarettes	1
pocketbook	1
matches	1
and	1
watch	1
with	1
its	1
double	1
chain	1
and	1
seals	1
and	1
shaking	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
feeling	1
himself	1
clean	1
fragrant	1
healthy	1
and	1
physically	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
unhappiness	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
swing	1
on	1
each	1
leg	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
coffee	1
was	1
already	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
beside	1
the	1
coffee	1
letters	1
and	1
papers	1
from	1
the	1
office	1
He	1
read	1
the	1
letters	1
One	1
was	1
very	1
unpleasant	1
from	1
a	1
merchant	1
who	1
was	1
buying	1
a	1
forest	1
on	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
property	1
To	1
sell	1
this	1
forest	1
was	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
but	1
at	1
present	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
reconciled	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
subject	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
discussed	1
The	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
pecuniary	1
interests	1
should	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
And	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
led	1
on	1
by	1
his	1
interests	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
seek	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
idea	1
hurt	1
him	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
letters	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
moved	1
the	1
office	1
papers	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
rapidly	1
looked	1
through	1
two	1
pieces	1
of	1
business	1
made	1
a	1
few	1
notes	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
pencil	1
and	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
papers	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
coffee	1
As	1
he	1
sipped	1
his	1
coffee	1
he	1
opened	1
a	1
still	1
damp	1
morning	1
paper	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
took	1
in	1
and	1
read	1
a	1
liberal	1
paper	1
not	1
an	1
extreme	1
one	1
but	1
one	1
advocating	1
the	1
views	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
science	1
art	1
and	1
politics	1
had	1
no	1
special	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
firmly	1
held	1
those	1
views	1
on	1
all	1
these	1
subjects	1
which	1
were	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
paper	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
changed	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
majority	1
changed	1
them	1
or	1
more	1
strictly	1
speaking	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
imperceptibly	1
changed	1
of	1
themselves	1
within	1
him	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
not	1
chosen	1
his	1
political	1
opinions	1
or	1
his	1
views	1
these	1
political	1
opinions	1
and	1
views	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
themselves	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
coat	1
but	1
simply	1
took	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
worn	1
And	1
for	1
him	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
society	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
need	1
ordinarily	1
developed	1
at	1
years	1
of	1
discretion	1
for	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
mental	1
activity	1
to	1
have	1
views	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
indispensable	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
hat	1
If	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
preferring	1
liberal	1
to	1
conservative	1
views	1
which	1
were	1
held	1
also	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
circle	1
it	1
arose	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
considering	1
liberalism	1
more	1
rational	1
but	1
from	1
its	1
being	1
in	1
closer	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
The	1
liberal	1
party	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
Russia	1
everything	1
is	1
wrong	1
and	1
certainly	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
many	1
debts	1
and	1
was	1
decidedly	1
short	1
of	1
money	1
The	1
liberal	1
party	1
said	1
that	1
marriage	1
is	1
an	1
institution	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
date	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
needs	1
reconstruction	1
and	1
family	1
life	1
certainly	1
afforded	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
little	1
gratification	1
and	1
forced	1
him	1
into	1
lying	1
and	1
hypocrisy	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
repulsive	1
to	1
his	1
nature	1
The	1
liberal	1
party	1
said	1
or	1
rather	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
religion	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
curb	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
check	1
the	1
barbarous	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
through	1
even	1
a	1
short	1
service	1
without	1
his	1
legs	1
aching	1
from	1
standing	1
up	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
high	1
flown	1
language	1
about	1
another	1
world	1
when	1
life	1
might	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
amusing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
And	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
liked	1
a	1
joke	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
puzzling	1
a	1
plain	1
man	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
origin	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
Rurik	1
and	1
disown	1
the	1
first	1
founder	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
the	1
monkey	1
And	1
so	1
Liberalism	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
and	1
he	1
liked	1
his	1
newspaper	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
cigar	1
after	1
dinner	1
for	1
the	1
slight	1
fog	1
it	1
diffused	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
He	1
read	1
the	1
leading	1
article	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
maintained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
senseless	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
to	1
raise	1
an	1
outcry	1
that	1
radicalism	1
was	1
threatening	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
all	1
conservative	1
elements	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
revolutionary	1
hydra	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
in	1
our	1
opinion	1
the	1
danger	1
lies	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
fantastic	1
revolutionary	1
hydra	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
traditionalism	1
clogging	1
progress	1
etc	1
etc	1
He	1
read	1
another	1
article	1
too	1
a	1
financial	1
one	1
which	1
alluded	1
to	1
Bentham	1
and	1
Mill	1
and	1
dropped	1
some	1
innuendoes	1
reflecting	1
on	1
the	1
ministry	1
With	1
his	1
characteristic	1
quickwittedness	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
each	1
innuendo	1
divined	1
whence	1
it	1
came	1
at	1
whom	1
and	1
on	1
what	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
aimed	1
and	1
that	1
afforded	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
did	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
But	1
today	1
that	1
satisfaction	1
was	1
embittered	1
by	1
Matrona	1
Philimonovna	1
s	1
advice	1
and	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
He	1
read	1
too	1
that	1
Count	1
Beist	1
was	1
rumored	1
to	1
have	1
left	1
for	1
Wiesbaden	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
need	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
gray	1
hair	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
a	1
light	1
carriage	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
person	1
seeking	1
a	1
situation	1
but	1
these	1
items	1
of	1
information	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
usual	1
a	1
quiet	1
ironical	1
gratification	1
Having	1
finished	1
the	1
paper	1
a	1
second	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
and	1
a	1
roll	1
and	1
butter	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
shaking	1
the	1
crumbs	1
of	1
the	1
roll	1
off	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
squaring	1
his	1
broad	1
chest	1
he	1
smiled	1
joyously	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
joyous	1
smile	1
was	1
evoked	1
by	1
a	1
good	1
digestion	1
But	1
this	1
joyous	1
smile	1
at	1
once	1
recalled	1
everything	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
Two	1
childish	1
voices	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
recognized	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
Grisha	1
his	1
youngest	1
boy	1
and	1
Tanya	1
his	1
eldest	1
girl	1
were	1
heard	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
They	1
were	1
carrying	1
something	1
and	1
dropped	1
it	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
sit	1
passengers	1
on	1
the	1
roof	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
in	1
English	1
there	1
pick	1
them	1
up	1
Everything	1
s	1
in	1
confusion	1
thought	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
running	1
about	1
by	1
themselves	1
And	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
They	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
box	1
that	1
represented	1
a	1
train	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
favorite	1
ran	1
up	1
boldly	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
hung	1
laughingly	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
enjoying	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
scent	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
whiskers	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
kissed	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
flushed	1
from	1
his	1
stooping	1
posture	1
and	1
beaming	1
with	1
tenderness	1
loosed	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
again	1
but	1
her	1
father	1
held	1
her	1
back	1
How	1
is	1
mamma	1
he	1
asked	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
smooth	1
soft	1
little	1
neck	1
Good	1
morning	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
greet	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
boy	1
less	1
and	1
always	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
fair	1
but	1
the	1
boy	1
felt	1
it	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
chilly	1
smile	1
Mamma	1
She	1
is	1
up	1
answered	1
the	1
girl	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sighed	1
That	1
means	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
slept	1
again	1
all	1
night	1
he	1
thought	1
Well	1
is	1
she	1
cheerful	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
quarrel	1
between	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
cheerful	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
must	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pretending	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
about	1
it	1
so	1
lightly	1
And	1
she	1
blushed	1
for	1
her	1
father	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
perceived	1
it	1
and	1
blushed	1
too	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
we	1
must	1
do	1
our	1
lessons	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
with	1
Miss	1
Hoole	1
to	1
grandmamma	1
s	1
Well	1
go	1
Tanya	1
my	1
darling	1
Oh	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
though	1
he	1
said	1
still	1
holding	1
her	1
and	1
stroking	1
her	1
soft	1
little	1
hand	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
it	1
yesterday	1
a	1
little	1
box	1
of	1
sweets	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
two	1
picking	1
out	1
her	1
favorites	1
a	1
chocolate	1
and	1
a	1
fondant	1
For	1
Grisha	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
chocolate	1
Yes	1
yes	1
And	1
still	1
stroking	1
her	1
little	1
shoulder	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
neck	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
The	1
carriage	1
is	1
ready	1
said	1
Matvey	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
someone	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
petition	1
Been	1
here	1
long	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Half	1
an	1
hour	1
How	1
many	1
times	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
One	1
must	1
let	1
you	1
drink	1
your	1
coffee	1
in	1
peace	1
at	1
least	1
said	1
Matvey	1
in	1
the	1
affectionately	1
gruff	1
tone	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
Well	1
show	1
the	1
person	1
up	1
at	1
once	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
frowning	1
with	1
vexation	1
The	1
petitioner	1
the	1
widow	1
of	1
a	1
staff	1
captain	1
Kalinin	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
request	1
impossible	1
and	1
unreasonable	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
he	1
generally	1
did	1
made	1
her	1
sit	1
down	1
heard	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
attentively	1
without	1
interrupting	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
detailed	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
to	1
apply	1
and	1
even	1
wrote	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
sprawling	1
good	1
and	1
legible	1
hand	1
a	1
confident	1
and	1
fluent	1
little	1
note	1
to	1
a	1
personage	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
her	1
Having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
s	1
widow	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
took	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
recollect	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
anything	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
nothing	1
except	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
wife	1
Ah	1
yes	1
He	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
harassed	1
expression	1
To	1
go	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
falsity	1
that	1
to	1
amend	1
to	1
set	1
right	1
their	1
relations	1
was	1
impossible	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
attractive	1
again	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
inspire	1
love	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
not	1
susceptible	1
to	1
love	1
Except	1
deceit	1
and	1
lying	1
nothing	1
could	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
now	1
and	1
deceit	1
and	1
lying	1
were	1
opposed	1
to	1
his	1
nature	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
though	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
give	1
himself	1
courage	1
He	1
squared	1
his	1
chest	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1
took	1
two	1
whiffs	1
at	1
it	1
flung	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
mother	1
of	1
pearl	1
ashtray	1
and	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
into	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
bedroom	1
Chapter	1

Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
in	1
a	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
now	1
scanty	1
once	1
luxuriant	1
and	1
beautiful	1
hair	1
fastened	1
up	1
with	1
hairpins	1
on	1
the	1
nape	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
with	1
a	1
sunken	1
thin	1
face	1
and	1
large	1
startled	1
eyes	1
which	1
looked	1
prominent	1
from	1
the	1
thinness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
standing	1
among	1
a	1
litter	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
scattered	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
an	1
open	1
bureau	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
something	1
Hearing	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
steps	1
she	1
stopped	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
trying	1
assiduously	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
features	1
a	1
severe	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
expression	1
She	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
interview	1
She	1
was	1
just	1
attempting	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
attempted	1
to	1
do	1
ten	1
times	1
already	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
sort	1
out	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
things	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
but	1
now	1
again	1
as	1
each	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
kept	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
things	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
take	1
some	1
step	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
shame	1
avenge	1
on	1
him	1
some	1
little	1
part	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
suffering	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
her	1
She	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
tell	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
leave	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
impossible	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
because	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
regarding	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
loving	1
him	1
Besides	1
this	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
even	1
here	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
manage	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
her	1
five	1
children	1
properly	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
worse	1
off	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
days	1
the	1
youngest	1
was	1
unwell	1
from	1
being	1
given	1
unwholesome	1
soup	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
almost	1
gone	1
without	1
their	1
dinner	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
She	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
but	1
cheating	1
herself	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
sorting	1
out	1
her	1
things	1
and	1
pretending	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
Seeing	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
hands	1
into	1
the	1
drawer	1
of	1
the	1
bureau	1
as	1
though	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
and	1
only	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
quite	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
severe	1
and	1
resolute	1
expression	1
betrayed	1
bewilderment	1
and	1
suffering	1
Dolly	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
subdued	1
and	1
timid	1
voice	1
He	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
towards	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
pitiful	1
and	1
humble	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
radiant	1
with	1
freshness	1
and	1
health	1
In	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
she	1
scanned	1
his	1
figure	1
that	1
beamed	1
with	1
health	1
and	1
freshness	1
Yes	1
he	1
is	1
happy	1
and	1
content	1
she	1
thought	1
while	1
I	1
And	1
that	1
disgusting	1
good	1
nature	1
which	1
everyone	1
likes	1
him	1
for	1
and	1
praises	1
I	1
hate	1
that	1
good	1
nature	1
of	1
his	1
she	1
thought	1
Her	1
mouth	1
stiffened	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
the	1
cheek	1
contracted	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
pale	1
nervous	1
face	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
rapid	1
deep	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
Dolly	1
he	1
repeated	1
with	1
a	1
quiver	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
Anna	1
is	1
coming	1
today	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
her	1
she	1
cried	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
really	1
Dolly	1
Go	1
away	1
go	1
away	1
go	1
away	1
she	1
shrieked	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
this	1
shriek	1
were	1
called	1
up	1
by	1
physical	1
pain	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
could	1
be	1
calm	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
could	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
as	1
Matvey	1
expressed	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
quietly	1
go	1
on	1
reading	1
his	1
paper	1
and	1
drinking	1
his	1
coffee	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
tortured	1
suffering	1
face	1
heard	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
submissive	1
to	1
fate	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
despair	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
catch	1
in	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
a	1
lump	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
shine	1
with	1
tears	1
My	1
God	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
Dolly	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
You	1
know	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sob	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
She	1
shut	1
the	1
bureau	1
with	1
a	1
slam	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
Dolly	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
One	1
thing	1
forgive	1
Remember	1
cannot	1
nine	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
atone	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
listened	1
expecting	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
beseeching	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
believe	1
differently	1
instant	1
of	1
passion	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
word	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
pang	1
of	1
physical	1
pain	1
her	1
lips	1
stiffened	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
her	1
right	1
cheek	1
worked	1
Go	1
away	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
shrieked	1
still	1
more	1
shrilly	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
passion	1
and	1
your	1
loathsomeness	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
but	1
tottered	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
to	1
support	1
herself	1
His	1
face	1
relaxed	1
his	1
lips	1
swelled	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
swimming	1
with	1
tears	1
Dolly	1
he	1
said	1
sobbing	1
now	1
for	1
mercy	1
s	1
sake	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
punish	1
me	1
make	1
me	1
expiate	1
my	1
fault	1
Anything	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
no	1
words	1
can	1
express	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
But	1
Dolly	1
forgive	1
me	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
hard	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
unutterably	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
She	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
He	1
waited	1
You	1
remember	1
the	1
children	1
Stiva	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
I	1
remember	1
them	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
their	1
ruin	1
she	1
said	1
obviously	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
phrases	1
she	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
She	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
Stiva	1
and	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
gratitude	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
she	1
drew	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
aversion	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
myself	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
By	1
taking	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
their	1
father	1
or	1
by	1
leaving	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
vicious	1
father	1
yes	1
a	1
vicious	1
father	1
Tell	1
me	1
after	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
can	1
we	1
live	1
together	1
Is	1
that	1
possible	1
Tell	1
me	1
eh	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
she	1
repeated	1
raising	1
her	1
voice	1
after	1
my	1
husband	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
my	1
children	1
enters	1
into	1
a	1
love	1
affair	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
children	1
s	1
governess	1
But	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
he	1
kept	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
pitiful	1
voice	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
his	1
head	1
sank	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
You	1
are	1
loathsome	1
to	1
me	1
repulsive	1
she	1
shrieked	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
heated	1
Your	1
tears	1
mean	1
nothing	1
You	1
have	1
never	1
loved	1
me	1
you	1
have	1
neither	1
heart	1
nor	1
honorable	1
feeling	1
You	1
are	1
hateful	1
to	1
me	1
disgusting	1
a	1
stranger	1
yes	1
a	1
complete	1
stranger	1
With	1
pain	1
and	1
wrath	1
she	1
uttered	1
the	1
word	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
herself	1
stranger	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
fury	1
expressed	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
alarmed	1
and	1
amazed	1
him	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
his	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
exasperated	1
her	1
She	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
sympathy	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
not	1
love	1
No	1
she	1
hates	1
me	1
She	1
will	1
not	1
forgive	1
me	1
he	1
thought	1
It	1
is	1
awful	1
awful	1
he	1
said	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
a	1
child	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
probably	1
it	1
had	1
fallen	1
down	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
listened	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
softened	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
pulling	1
herself	1
together	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
rapidly	1
she	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
Well	1
she	1
loves	1
my	1
child	1
he	1
thought	1
noticing	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
cry	1
my	1
child	1
how	1
can	1
she	1
hate	1
me	1
Dolly	1
one	1
word	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
following	1
her	1
If	1
you	1
come	1
near	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
servants	1
the	1
children	1
They	1
may	1
all	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
live	1
here	1
with	1
your	1
mistress	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
slamming	1
the	1
door	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sighed	1
wiped	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
subdued	1
tread	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Matvey	1
says	1
she	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
but	1
how	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
the	1
least	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
Ah	1
oh	1
how	1
horrible	1
it	1
is	1
And	1
how	1
vulgarly	1
she	1
shouted	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
remembering	1
her	1
shriek	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
scoundrel	1
and	1
mistress	1
And	1
very	1
likely	1
the	1
maids	1
were	1
listening	1
Horribly	1
vulgar	1
horrible	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
stood	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
alone	1
wiped	1
his	1
face	1
squared	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
It	1
was	1
Friday	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
the	1
German	1
watchmaker	1
was	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
clock	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
remembered	1
his	1
joke	1
about	1
this	1
punctual	1
bald	1
watchmaker	1
that	1
the	1
German	1
was	1
wound	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
lifetime	1
himself	1
to	1
wind	1
up	1
watches	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
joke	1
And	1
maybe	1
she	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
That	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
expression	1
come	1
round	1
	1
he	1
thought	1
I	1
must	1
repeat	1
that	1
Matvey	1
he	1
shouted	1
Arrange	1
everything	1
with	1
Darya	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
for	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Matvey	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
Yes	1
sir	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
You	1
won	1
t	1
dine	1
at	1
home	1
said	1
Matvey	1
seeing	1
him	1
off	1
That	1
s	1
as	1
it	1
happens	1
But	1
here	1
s	1
for	1
the	1
housekeeping	1
he	1
said	1
taking	1
ten	1
roubles	1
from	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
That	1
ll	1
be	1
enough	1
Enough	1
or	1
not	1
enough	1
we	1
must	1
make	1
it	1
do	1
said	1
Matvey	1
slamming	1
the	1
carriage	1
door	1
and	1
stepping	1
back	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
meanwhile	1
having	1
pacified	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
knowing	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
bedroom	1
It	1
was	1
her	1
solitary	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
household	1
cares	1
which	1
crowded	1
upon	1
her	1
directly	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
it	1
Even	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
and	1
Matrona	1
Philimonovna	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
putting	1
several	1
questions	1
to	1
her	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
which	1
only	1
she	1
could	1
answer	1
What	1
were	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
for	1
their	1
walk	1
Should	1
they	1
have	1
any	1
milk	1
Should	1
not	1
a	1
new	1
cook	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
Ah	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
bedroom	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
when	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
clasping	1
tightly	1
her	1
thin	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
rings	1
that	1
slipped	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
bony	1
fingers	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
memory	1
all	1
the	1
conversation	1
He	1
has	1
gone	1
But	1
has	1
he	1
broken	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
thought	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
he	1
sees	1
her	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
I	1
ask	1
him	1
No	1
no	1
reconciliation	1
is	1
impossible	1
Even	1
if	1
we	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
we	1
are	1
strangers	1
strangers	1
forever	1
She	1
repeated	1
again	1
with	1
special	1
significance	1
the	1
word	1
so	1
dreadful	1
to	1
her	1
And	1
how	1
I	1
loved	1
him	1
my	1
God	1
how	1
I	1
loved	1
him	1
How	1
I	1
loved	1
him	1
And	1
now	1
don	1
t	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
Don	1
t	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
before	1
The	1
most	1
horrible	1
thing	1
is	1
she	1
began	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
her	1
thought	1
because	1
Matrona	1
Philimonovna	1
put	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Let	1
us	1
send	1
for	1
my	1
brother	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
dinner	1
anyway	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
children	1
getting	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
till	1
six	1
again	1
like	1
yesterday	1
Very	1
well	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
directly	1
and	1
see	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
did	1
you	1
send	1
for	1
some	1
new	1
milk	1
And	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
drowned	1
her	1
grief	1
in	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
Chapter	1
5	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
learned	1
easily	1
at	1
school	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
excellent	1
abilities	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
idle	1
and	1
mischievous	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
in	1
his	1
class	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
habitually	1
dissipated	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
his	1
inferior	1
grade	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
his	1
comparative	1
youth	1
he	1
occupied	1
the	1
honorable	1
and	1
lucrative	1
position	1
of	1
president	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
boards	1
at	1
Moscow	1
This	1
post	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
through	1
his	1
sister	1
Anna	1
s	1
husband	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Karenin	1
who	1
held	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
positions	1
in	1
the	1
ministry	1
to	1
whose	1
department	1
the	1
Moscow	1
office	1
belonged	1
But	1
if	1
Karenin	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
this	1
berth	1
then	1
through	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
personages	1
brothers	1
sisters	1
cousins	1
uncles	1
and	1
aunts	1
Stiva	1
Oblonsky	1
would	1
have	1
received	1
this	1
post	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
similar	1
one	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
salary	1
of	1
six	1
thousand	1
absolutely	1
needful	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
affairs	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
considerable	1
property	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
embarrassed	1
condition	1
Half	1
Moscow	1
and	1
Petersburg	1
were	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
He	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
powerful	1
ones	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
One	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
the	1
older	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
friends	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
and	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
in	1
petticoats	1
another	1
third	1
were	1
his	1
intimate	1
chums	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
were	1
friendly	1
acquaintances	1
Consequently	1
the	1
distributors	1
of	1
earthly	1
blessings	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
places	1
rents	1
shares	1
and	1
such	1
were	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
overlook	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
set	1
and	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
special	1
exertion	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lucrative	1
post	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
refuse	1
things	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
jealousy	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
quarrelsome	1
or	1
take	1
offense	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
from	1
his	1
characteristic	1
good	1
nature	1
he	1
never	1
did	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
absurd	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
a	1
position	1
with	1
the	1
salary	1
he	1
required	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
expected	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
only	1
wanted	1
what	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
age	1
and	1
standing	1
did	1
get	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
worse	1
qualified	1
for	1
performing	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
liked	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
humor	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
bright	1
disposition	1
and	1
his	1
unquestionable	1
honesty	1
In	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
handsome	1
radiant	1
figure	1
his	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
and	1
red	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
which	1
produced	1
a	1
physical	1
effect	1
of	1
kindliness	1
and	1
good	1
humor	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
met	1
him	1
Aha	1
Stiva	1
Oblonsky	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
on	1
meeting	1
him	1
Even	1
though	1
it	1
happened	1
at	1
times	1
that	1
after	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
nothing	1
particularly	1
delightful	1
had	1
happened	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
everyone	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
delighted	1
at	1
meeting	1
him	1
again	1
After	1
filling	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
president	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
boards	1
at	1
Moscow	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
respect	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
liking	1
of	1
his	1
fellow	1
officials	1
subordinates	1
and	1
superiors	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
him	1
The	1
principal	1
qualities	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
which	1
had	1
gained	1
him	1
this	1
universal	1
respect	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
indulgence	1
for	1
others	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
shortcomings	1
secondly	1
of	1
his	1
perfect	1
liberalism	1
not	1
the	1
liberalism	1
he	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
but	1
the	1
liberalism	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
blood	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
treated	1
all	1
men	1
perfectly	1
equally	1
and	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
whatever	1
their	1
fortune	1
or	1
calling	1
might	1
be	1
and	1
thirdly	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
point	1
his	1
complete	1
indifference	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
never	1
made	1
mistakes	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
escorted	1
by	1
a	1
deferential	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
portfolio	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
little	1
private	1
room	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
uniform	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
boardroom	1
The	1
clerks	1
and	1
copyists	1
all	1
rose	1
greeting	1
him	1
with	1
good	1
humored	1
deference	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
moved	1
quickly	1
as	1
ever	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
his	1
colleagues	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
joke	1
or	1
two	1
and	1
talked	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
was	1
consistent	1
with	1
due	1
decorum	1
and	1
began	1
work	1
No	1
one	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
how	1
to	1
hit	1
on	1
the	1
exact	1
line	1
between	1
freedom	1
simplicity	1
and	1
official	1
stiffness	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
agreeable	1
conduct	1
of	1
business	1
A	1
secretary	1
with	1
the	1
good	1
humored	1
deference	1
common	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
office	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
papers	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
familiar	1
and	1
easy	1
tone	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
introduced	1
by	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
We	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
the	1
information	1
from	1
the	1
government	1
department	1
of	1
Penza	1
Here	1
would	1
you	1
care	1
You	1
ve	1
got	1
them	1
at	1
last	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laying	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
paper	1
Now	1
gentlemen	1
And	1
the	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
began	1
If	1
they	1
knew	1
he	1
thought	1
bending	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
air	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
report	1
what	1
a	1
guilty	1
little	1
boy	1
their	1
president	1
was	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
And	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
laughing	1
during	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
report	1
Till	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
sitting	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
without	1
a	1
break	1
and	1
at	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
interval	1
and	1
luncheon	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
two	1
when	1
the	1
large	1
glass	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
boardroom	1
suddenly	1
opened	1
and	1
someone	1
came	1
in	1
All	1
the	1
officials	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
side	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
eagle	1
delighted	1
at	1
any	1
distraction	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
once	1
drove	1
out	1
the	1
intruder	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
glass	1
door	1
after	1
him	1
When	1
the	1
case	1
had	1
been	1
read	1
through	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stretched	1
and	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
liberalism	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1
in	1
the	1
boardroom	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
the	1
old	1
veteran	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
Nikitin	1
and	1
the	1
Kammerjunker	1
Grinevitch	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
We	1
shall	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
after	1
lunch	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
we	1
shall	1
said	1
Nikitin	1
A	1
pretty	1
sharp	1
fellow	1
this	1
Fomin	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
Grinevitch	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
they	1
were	1
examining	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
frowned	1
at	1
Grinevitch	1
s	1
words	1
giving	1
him	1
thereby	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
improper	1
to	1
pass	1
judgment	1
prematurely	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
no	1
reply	1
Who	1
was	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
Someone	1
your	1
excellency	1
crept	1
in	1
without	1
permission	1
directly	1
my	1
back	1
was	1
turned	1
He	1
was	1
asking	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
members	1
come	1
out	1
then	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
Maybe	1
he	1
s	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
but	1
here	1
he	1
comes	1
anyway	1
That	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
strongly	1
built	1
broad	1
shouldered	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
curly	1
beard	1
who	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
sheepskin	1
cap	1
was	1
running	1
lightly	1
and	1
rapidly	1
up	1
the	1
worn	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
stone	1
staircase	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
going	1
down	1
a	1
lean	1
official	1
with	1
a	1
portfolio	1
stood	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
looked	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
then	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Oblonsky	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
His	1
good	1
naturedly	1
beaming	1
face	1
above	1
the	1
embroidered	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
beamed	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
when	1
he	1
recognized	1
the	1
man	1
coming	1
up	1
Why	1
it	1
s	1
actually	1
you	1
Levin	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
mocking	1
smile	1
scanning	1
Levin	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
deigned	1
to	1
look	1
me	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
den	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
with	1
shaking	1
hands	1
he	1
kissed	1
his	1
friend	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
and	1
very	1
much	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
looking	1
shyly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
angrily	1
and	1
uneasily	1
around	1
Well	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
friend	1
s	1
sensitive	1
and	1
irritable	1
shyness	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
drew	1
him	1
along	1
as	1
though	1
guiding	1
him	1
through	1
dangers	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
on	1
familiar	1
terms	1
with	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
called	1
almost	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
Christian	1
names	1
old	1
men	1
of	1
sixty	1
boys	1
of	1
twenty	1
actors	1
ministers	1
merchants	1
and	1
adjutant	1
generals	1
so	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
intimate	1
chums	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
social	1
ladder	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
Oblonsky	1
something	1
in	1
common	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
familiar	1
friend	1
of	1
everyone	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne	1
with	1
everyone	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
consequence	1
he	1
met	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
disreputable	1
chums	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
in	1
joke	1
to	1
call	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
subordinates	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
how	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
tact	1
to	1
diminish	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
them	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
disreputable	1
chum	1
but	1
Oblonsky	1
with	1
his	1
ready	1
tact	1
felt	1
that	1
Levin	1
fancied	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
intimacy	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
his	1
subordinates	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
off	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
Levin	1
was	1
almost	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
as	1
Oblonsky	1
their	1
intimacy	1
did	1
not	1
rest	1
merely	1
on	1
champagne	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
friend	1
and	1
companion	1
of	1
his	1
early	1
youth	1
They	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
their	1
characters	1
and	1
tastes	1
as	1
friends	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
together	1
in	1
early	1
youth	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
selected	1
careers	1
of	1
different	1
kinds	1
though	1
in	1
discussion	1
he	1
would	1
even	1
justify	1
the	1
other	1
s	1
career	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
despised	1
it	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
led	1
himself	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
real	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
led	1
by	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
phantasm	1
Oblonsky	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
a	1
slight	1
mocking	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Levin	1
How	1
often	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
but	1
what	1
precisely	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
could	1
never	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
and	1
indeed	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
Levin	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
always	1
excited	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
rather	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
want	1
of	1
ease	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
with	1
a	1
perfectly	1
new	1
unexpected	1
view	1
of	1
things	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughed	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
liked	1
it	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Levin	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
despised	1
the	1
town	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
his	1
official	1
duties	1
which	1
he	1
laughed	1
at	1
and	1
regarded	1
as	1
trifling	1
But	1
the	1
difference	1
was	1
that	1
Oblonsky	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
everyone	1
did	1
laughed	1
complacently	1
and	1
good	1
humoredly	1
while	1
Levin	1
laughed	1
without	1
complacency	1
and	1
sometimes	1
angrily	1
We	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
expecting	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
going	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
letting	1
Levin	1
s	1
hand	1
go	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
here	1
all	1
danger	1
was	1
over	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
Well	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
Eh	1
When	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
Levin	1
was	1
silent	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
unknown	1
faces	1
of	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
two	1
companions	1
and	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
elegant	1
Grinevitch	1
which	1
had	1
such	1
long	1
white	1
fingers	1
such	1
long	1
yellow	1
filbert	1
shaped	1
nails	1
and	1
such	1
huge	1
shining	1
studs	1
on	1
the	1
shirt	1
cuff	1
that	1
apparently	1
they	1
absorbed	1
all	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
allowed	1
him	1
no	1
freedom	1
of	1
thought	1
Oblonsky	1
noticed	1
this	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
smiled	1
Ah	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
My	1
colleagues	1
Philip	1
Ivanitch	1
Nikitin	1
Mihail	1
Stanislavitch	1
Grinevitch	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Levin	1
a	1
district	1
councilor	1
a	1
modern	1
district	1
councilman	1
a	1
gymnast	1
who	1
lifts	1
thirteen	1
stone	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
a	1
cattle	1
breeder	1
and	1
sportsman	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Levin	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Koznishev	1
Delighted	1
said	1
the	1
veteran	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
knowing	1
your	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
said	1
Grinevitch	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
slender	1
hand	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
nails	1
Levin	1
frowned	1
shook	1
hands	1
coldly	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
turned	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
half	1
brother	1
an	1
author	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
Russia	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
it	1
when	1
people	1
treated	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Koznishev	1
No	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
district	1
councilor	1
I	1
have	1
quarreled	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
meetings	1
any	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
You	1
ve	1
been	1
quick	1
about	1
it	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
But	1
how	1
why	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
story	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
said	1
Levin	1
but	1
he	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
Well	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
shortly	1
I	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
really	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
district	1
councils	1
or	1
ever	1
could	1
be	1
he	1
began	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
had	1
just	1
insulted	1
him	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
plaything	1
they	1
play	1
at	1
being	1
a	1
parliament	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
neither	1
young	1
enough	1
nor	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
amusement	1
in	1
playthings	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
he	1
stammered	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
means	1
for	1
the	1
coterie	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
to	1
make	1
money	1
Formerly	1
they	1
had	1
wardships	1
courts	1
of	1
justice	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
bribes	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
unearned	1
salary	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
hotly	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
had	1
opposed	1
his	1
opinion	1
Aha	1
You	1
re	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
phase	1
again	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
conservative	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
However	1
we	1
can	1
go	1
into	1
that	1
later	1
Yes	1
later	1
But	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
looking	1
with	1
hatred	1
at	1
Grinevitch	1
s	1
hand	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
gave	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
wear	1
European	1
dress	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
scanning	1
his	1
new	1
suit	1
obviously	1
cut	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
tailor	1
Ah	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
new	1
phase	1
Levin	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
not	1
as	1
grown	1
men	1
blush	1
slightly	1
without	1
being	1
themselves	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
as	1
boys	1
blush	1
feeling	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
ridiculous	1
through	1
their	1
shyness	1
and	1
consequently	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
blushing	1
still	1
more	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
tears	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
sensible	1
manly	1
face	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
childish	1
plight	1
that	1
Oblonsky	1
left	1
off	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
Oh	1
where	1
shall	1
we	1
meet	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
want	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
Oblonsky	1
seemed	1
to	1
ponder	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
to	1
Gurin	1
s	1
to	1
lunch	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
can	1
talk	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
till	1
three	1
No	1
answered	1
Levin	1
after	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
thought	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
somewhere	1
else	1
All	1
right	1
then	1
let	1
s	1
dine	1
together	1
Dine	1
together	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
very	1
particular	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
a	1
question	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
afterwards	1
Well	1
say	1
the	1
few	1
words	1
then	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
gossip	1
after	1
dinner	1
Well	1
it	1
s	1
this	1
said	1
Levin	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
though	1
His	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
took	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
from	1
the	1
effort	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
to	1
surmount	1
his	1
shyness	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
doing	1
Everything	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
Kitty	1
gave	1
a	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
merrily	1
You	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
because	1
Excuse	1
me	1
a	1
minute	1
A	1
secretary	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
respectful	1
familiarity	1
and	1
the	1
modest	1
consciousness	1
characteristic	1
of	1
every	1
secretary	1
of	1
superiority	1
to	1
his	1
chief	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
business	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
with	1
some	1
papers	1
and	1
began	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
asking	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
explain	1
some	1
objection	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
without	1
hearing	1
him	1
out	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
genially	1
on	1
the	1
secretary	1
s	1
sleeve	1
No	1
you	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
softening	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
brief	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
said	1
So	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
way	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
Zahar	1
Nikititch	1
The	1
secretary	1
retired	1
in	1
confusion	1
During	1
the	1
consultation	1
with	1
the	1
secretary	1
Levin	1
had	1
completely	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
embarrassment	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
ironical	1
attention	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
What	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
understand	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
smiling	1
as	1
brightly	1
as	1
ever	1
and	1
picking	1
up	1
a	1
cigarette	1
He	1
expected	1
some	1
queer	1
outburst	1
from	1
Levin	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
said	1
Levin	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
seriously	1
Why	1
not	1
Why	1
because	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
You	1
think	1
so	1
but	1
we	1
re	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
work	1
On	1
paper	1
But	1
there	1
you	1
ve	1
a	1
gift	1
for	1
it	1
added	1
Levin	1
That	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
think	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
something	1
in	1
me	1
Perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
Levin	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
admire	1
your	1
grandeur	1
and	1
am	1
proud	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
person	1
You	1
ve	1
not	1
answered	1
my	1
question	1
though	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
desperate	1
effort	1
looking	1
Oblonsky	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
You	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
yourself	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
nice	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
over	1
six	1
thousand	1
acres	1
in	1
the	1
Karazinsky	1
district	1
and	1
such	1
muscles	1
and	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
twelve	1
still	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
one	1
day	1
Yes	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
question	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
change	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
away	1
so	1
long	1
Oh	1
why	1
so	1
Levin	1
queried	1
panic	1
stricken	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
responded	1
Oblonsky	1
We	1
ll	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
town	1
Oh	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
about	1
that	1
too	1
later	1
on	1
said	1
Levin	1
reddening	1
again	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
ears	1
All	1
right	1
I	1
see	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
should	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
you	1
know	1
but	1
my	1
wife	1
s	1
not	1
quite	1
the	1
thing	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
they	1
re	1
sure	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
at	1

Zoological	1

to	1
five	1
Kitty	1

You	1
drive	1
along	1
there	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
and	1
fetch	1
you	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
dine	1
somewhere	1
together	1
Capital	1
So	1
good	1
bye	1
till	1
then	1
Now	1
mind	1
you	1
ll	1
forget	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
or	1
rush	1
off	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
called	1
out	1
laughing	1
No	1
truly	1
And	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
only	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
remembering	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
colleagues	1
That	1
gentleman	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
energy	1
said	1
Grinevitch	1
when	1
Levin	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
Yes	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
nodding	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
lucky	1
fellow	1
Over	1
six	1
thousand	1
acres	1
in	1
the	1
Karazinsky	1
district	1
everything	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
youth	1
and	1
vigor	1
Not	1
like	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
haven	1
t	1
you	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Ah	1
yes	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
a	1
poor	1
way	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
Chapter	1
6	1
When	1
Oblonsky	1
asked	1
Levin	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
town	1
Levin	1
blushed	1
and	1
was	1
furious	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
blushing	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
an	1
offer	1
though	1
that	1
was	1
precisely	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
The	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Levins	1
and	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
old	1
noble	1
Moscow	1
families	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
on	1
intimate	1
and	1
friendly	1
terms	1
This	1
intimacy	1
had	1
grown	1
still	1
closer	1
during	1
Levin	1
s	1
student	1
days	1
He	1
had	1
both	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
university	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
Prince	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Dolly	1
and	1
had	1
entered	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
him	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
Levin	1
used	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
household	1
Strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
appear	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
household	1
the	1
family	1
that	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
especially	1
with	1
the	1
feminine	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
his	1
own	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
only	1
sister	1
was	1
older	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
inner	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
noble	1
cultivated	1
and	1
honorable	1
family	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
deprived	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
All	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
family	1
especially	1
the	1
feminine	1
half	1
were	1
pictured	1
by	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
mysterious	1
poetical	1
veil	1
and	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
perceived	1
no	1
defects	1
whatever	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
poetical	1
veil	1
that	1
shrouded	1
them	1
he	1
assumed	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
loftiest	1
sentiments	1
and	1
every	1
possible	1
perfection	1
Why	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
had	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
speak	1
French	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
English	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
certain	1
hours	1
they	1
played	1
by	1
turns	1
on	1
the	1
piano	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
audible	1
in	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
room	1
above	1
where	1
the	1
students	1
used	1
to	1
work	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
visited	1
by	1
those	1
professors	1
of	1
French	1
literature	1
of	1
music	1
of	1
drawing	1
of	1
dancing	1
why	1
at	1
certain	1
hours	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
drove	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
to	1
the	1
Tversky	1
boulevard	1
dressed	1
in	1
their	1
satin	1
cloaks	1
Dolly	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
one	1
Natalia	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
long	1
one	1
and	1
Kitty	1
in	1
one	1
so	1
short	1
that	1
her	1
shapely	1
legs	1
in	1
tightly	1
drawn	1
red	1
stockings	1
were	1
visible	1
to	1
all	1
beholders	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
the	1
Tversky	1
boulevard	1
escorted	1
by	1
a	1
footman	1
with	1
a	1
gold	1
cockade	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
their	1
mysterious	1
world	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
there	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
precisely	1
with	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
proceedings	1
In	1
his	1
student	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
but	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
eldest	1
Dolly	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
married	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
second	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sisters	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
which	1
But	1
Natalia	1
too	1
had	1
hardly	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
when	1
she	1
married	1
the	1
diplomat	1
Lvov	1
Kitty	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
Levin	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
Young	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
navy	1
was	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
Baltic	1
and	1
Levin	1
s	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
Oblonsky	1
became	1
less	1
intimate	1
But	1
when	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
this	1
year	1
Levin	1
came	1
to	1
Moscow	1
after	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
he	1
realized	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
he	1
was	1
indeed	1
destined	1
to	1
love	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
simpler	1
than	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
rather	1
rich	1
than	1
poor	1
and	1
thirty	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
young	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
match	1
But	1
Levin	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
so	1
perfect	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1
far	1
above	1
everything	1
earthly	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1
so	1
low	1
and	1
so	1
earthly	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
be	1
conceived	1
that	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
she	1
herself	1
could	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
worthy	1
of	1
her	1
After	1
spending	1
two	1
months	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
enchantment	1
seeing	1
Kitty	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
in	1
society	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
went	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
he	1
abruptly	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
Levin	1
s	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
was	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
disadvantageous	1
and	1
worthless	1
match	1
for	1
the	1
charming	1
Kitty	1
and	1
that	1
Kitty	1
herself	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
In	1
her	1
family	1
s	1
eyes	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
ordinary	1
definite	1
career	1
and	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
while	1
his	1
contemporaries	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
thirty	1
two	1
were	1
already	1
one	1
a	1
colonel	1
and	1
another	1
a	1
professor	1
another	1
director	1
of	1
a	1
bank	1
and	1
railways	1
or	1
president	1
of	1
a	1
board	1
like	1
Oblonsky	1
But	1
he	1
he	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
how	1
he	1
must	1
appear	1
to	1
others	1
was	1
a	1
country	1
gentleman	1
occupied	1
in	1
breeding	1
cattle	1
shooting	1
game	1
and	1
building	1
barns	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
a	1
fellow	1
of	1
no	1
ability	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
turned	1
out	1
well	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
doing	1
just	1
what	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
people	1
fit	1
for	1
nothing	1
else	1
The	1
mysterious	1
enchanting	1
Kitty	1
herself	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
such	1
an	1
ugly	1
person	1
as	1
he	1
conceived	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
such	1
an	1
ordinary	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
striking	1
person	1
Moreover	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
Kitty	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
a	1
grown	1
up	1
person	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
arising	1
from	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
yet	1
another	1
obstacle	1
to	1
love	1
An	1
ugly	1
good	1
natured	1
man	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
might	1
he	1
supposed	1
be	1
liked	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
love	1
as	1
that	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
loved	1
Kitty	1
one	1
would	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
handsome	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
a	1
distinguished	1
man	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
women	1
often	1
did	1
care	1
for	1
ugly	1
and	1
ordinary	1
men	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
for	1
he	1
judged	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
himself	1
have	1
loved	1
any	1
but	1
beautiful	1
mysterious	1
and	1
exceptional	1
women	1
But	1
after	1
spending	1
two	1
months	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
passions	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
experience	1
in	1
his	1
early	1
youth	1
that	1
this	1
feeling	1
gave	1
him	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
rest	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
deciding	1
the	1
question	1
would	1
she	1
or	1
would	1
she	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
despair	1
had	1
arisen	1
only	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
imaginings	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
rejected	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
determination	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
get	1
married	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
accepted	1
Or	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
rejected	1
Chapter	1
7	1
On	1
arriving	1
in	1
Moscow	1
by	1
a	1
morning	1
train	1
Levin	1
had	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
elder	1
half	1
brother	1
Koznishev	1
After	1
changing	1
his	1
clothes	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
study	1
intending	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
about	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
but	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
not	1
alone	1
With	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
professor	1
of	1
philosophy	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Harkov	1
expressly	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
a	1
difference	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
between	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
philosophical	1
question	1
The	1
professor	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
crusade	1
against	1
materialists	1
Sergey	1
Koznishev	1
had	1
been	1
following	1
this	1
crusade	1
with	1
interest	1
and	1
after	1
reading	1
the	1
professor	1
s	1
last	1
article	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
stating	1
his	1
objections	1
He	1
accused	1
the	1
professor	1
of	1
making	1
too	1
great	1
concessions	1
to	1
the	1
materialists	1
And	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
promptly	1
appeared	1
to	1
argue	1
the	1
matter	1
out	1
The	1
point	1
in	1
discussion	1
was	1
the	1
question	1
then	1
in	1
vogue	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
between	1
psychological	1
and	1
physiological	1
phenomena	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
where	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
met	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
chilly	1
friendliness	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
for	1
everyone	1
and	1
introducing	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
professor	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
A	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
spectacles	1
with	1
a	1
narrow	1
forehead	1
tore	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
discussion	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
greet	1
Levin	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
without	1
paying	1
any	1
further	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
Levin	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
professor	1
should	1
go	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
Levin	1
had	1
come	1
across	1
the	1
magazine	1
articles	1
about	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
disputing	1
and	1
had	1
read	1
them	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
science	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
natural	1
science	1
student	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
connected	1
these	1
scientific	1
deductions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
an	1
animal	1
as	1
to	1
reflex	1
action	1
biology	1
and	1
sociology	1
with	1
those	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
to	1
himself	1
which	1
had	1
of	1
late	1
been	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
argument	1
with	1
the	1
professor	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
connected	1
these	1
scientific	1
questions	1
with	1
those	1
spiritual	1
problems	1
that	1
at	1
times	1
they	1
almost	1
touched	1
on	1
the	1
latter	1
but	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
close	1
upon	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
they	1
promptly	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat	1
and	1
plunged	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
subtle	1
distinctions	1
reservations	1
quotations	1
allusions	1
and	1
appeals	1
to	1
authorities	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
I	1
cannot	1
admit	1
it	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
his	1
habitual	1
clearness	1
precision	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
elegance	1
of	1
phrase	1
I	1
cannot	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
agree	1
with	1
Keiss	1
that	1
my	1
whole	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
world	1
has	1
been	1
derived	1
from	1
perceptions	1
The	1
most	1
fundamental	1
idea	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
existence	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
me	1
through	1
sensation	1
indeed	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
special	1
sense	1
organ	1
for	1
the	1
transmission	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
Yes	1
but	1
they	1
Wurt	1
and	1
Knaust	1
and	1
Pripasov	1
would	1
answer	1
that	1
your	1
consciousness	1
of	1
existence	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
conjunction	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
sensations	1
that	1
that	1
consciousness	1
of	1
existence	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
your	1
sensations	1
Wurt	1
indeed	1
says	1
plainly	1
that	1
assuming	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
sensations	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
existence	1
I	1
maintain	1
the	1
contrary	1
began	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
But	1
here	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
close	1
upon	1
the	1
real	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
retreating	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
the	1
professor	1
According	1
to	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
senses	1
are	1
annihilated	1
if	1
my	1
body	1
is	1
dead	1
I	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
existence	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
he	1
queried	1
The	1
professor	1
in	1
annoyance	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
mental	1
suffering	1
at	1
the	1
interruption	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
inquirer	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
bargeman	1
than	1
a	1
philosopher	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
ask	1
What	1
s	1
one	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
with	1
far	1
less	1
heat	1
and	1
one	1
sidedness	1
than	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
sufficient	1
breadth	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
put	1
smiled	1
and	1
said	1
That	1
question	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
answer	1
as	1
yet	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
requisite	1
data	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
professor	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
argument	1
No	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
would	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
if	1
as	1
Pripasov	1
directly	1
asserts	1
perception	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
sensation	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
distinguish	1
sharply	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
conceptions	1
Levin	1
listened	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
simply	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
professor	1
to	1
go	1
Chapter	1
8	1
When	1
the	1
professor	1
had	1
gone	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Delighted	1
that	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
is	1
it	1
How	1
s	1
your	1
farming	1
getting	1
on	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
took	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
farming	1
and	1
only	1
put	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
deference	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
only	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
his	1
wheat	1
and	1
money	1
matters	1
Levin	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
his	1
determination	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
he	1
had	1
indeed	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
But	1
after	1
seeing	1
his	1
brother	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
professor	1
hearing	1
afterwards	1
the	1
unconsciously	1
patronizing	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
brother	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
agricultural	1
matters	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
property	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
divided	1
and	1
Levin	1
took	1
charge	1
of	1
both	1
their	1
shares	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
marrying	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
Well	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
district	1
council	1
doing	1
asked	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
was	1
greatly	1
interested	1
in	1
these	1
local	1
boards	1
and	1
attached	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
them	1
I	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
What	1
Why	1
surely	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
board	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
member	1
now	1
I	1
ve	1
resigned	1
answered	1
Levin	1
and	1
I	1
no	1
longer	1
attend	1
the	1
meetings	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
commented	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
frowning	1
Levin	1
in	1
self	1
defense	1
began	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
meetings	1
in	1
his	1
district	1
That	1
s	1
how	1
it	1
always	1
is	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
interrupted	1
him	1
We	1
Russians	1
are	1
always	1
like	1
that	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
s	1
our	1
strong	1
point	1
really	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
seeing	1
our	1
own	1
shortcomings	1
but	1
we	1
overdo	1
it	1
we	1
comfort	1
ourselves	1
with	1
irony	1
which	1
we	1
always	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
our	1
tongues	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
give	1
such	1
rights	1
as	1
our	1
local	1
self	1
government	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
European	1
people	1
why	1
the	1
Germans	1
or	1
the	1
English	1
would	1
have	1
worked	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
freedom	1
from	1
them	1
while	1
we	1
simply	1
turn	1
them	1
into	1
ridicule	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
helped	1
said	1
Levin	1
penitently	1
It	1
was	1
my	1
last	1
effort	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
try	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
I	1
m	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
it	1

it	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
should	1
Perhaps	1
not	1
Levin	1
answered	1
dejectedly	1
Oh	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
turned	1
up	1
again	1
This	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
was	1
the	1
elder	1
brother	1
of	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
and	1
half	1
brother	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
a	1
man	1
utterly	1
ruined	1
who	1
had	1
dissipated	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
fortune	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
lowest	1
company	1
and	1
had	1
quarreled	1
with	1
his	1
brothers	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
say	1
Levin	1
cried	1
with	1
horror	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
Prokofy	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
Here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
starting	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
s	1
excitement	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
living	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
his	1
IOU	1
to	1
Trubin	1
which	1
I	1
paid	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
answer	1
he	1
sent	1
me	1
And	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
took	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
under	1
a	1
paper	1
weight	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Levin	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
queer	1
familiar	1
handwriting	1
I	1
humbly	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
favor	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
my	1
gracious	1
brothers	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
head	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
note	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
opposite	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
struggle	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
between	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
unhappy	1
brother	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
base	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
He	1
obviously	1
wants	1
to	1
offend	1
me	1
pursued	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
but	1
he	1
cannot	1
offend	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
wished	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
Yes	1
yes	1
repeated	1
Levin	1
I	1
understand	1
and	1
appreciate	1
your	1
attitude	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
I	1
shouldn	1
t	1
advise	1
it	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
As	1
regards	1
myself	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
your	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
you	1
quarrel	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
you	1
would	1
do	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
do	1
him	1
any	1
good	1
still	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
Very	1
likely	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
do	1
any	1
good	1
but	1
I	1
feel	1
especially	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
another	1
thing	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
Well	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
One	1
thing	1
I	1
do	1
understand	1
he	1
added	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
lesson	1
in	1
humility	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
very	1
differently	1
and	1
more	1
charitably	1
on	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
infamous	1
since	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
has	1
become	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
awful	1
repeated	1
Levin	1
After	1
obtaining	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
address	1
from	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
footman	1
Levin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
setting	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thought	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
visit	1
till	1
the	1
evening	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
rest	1
was	1
to	1
accomplish	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
From	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
office	1
and	1
on	1
getting	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
he	1
might	1
find	1

Chapter	1
9	1
At	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
Levin	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
at	1
the	1
Zoological	1
Gardens	1
and	1
turned	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
frozen	1
mounds	1
and	1
the	1
skating	1
ground	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
find	1
her	1
there	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
frosty	1
day	1
Rows	1
of	1
carriages	1
sledges	1
drivers	1
and	1
policemen	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
approach	1
Crowds	1
of	1
well	1
dressed	1
people	1
with	1
hats	1
bright	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
swarmed	1
about	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
well	1
swept	1
little	1
paths	1
between	1
the	1
little	1
houses	1
adorned	1
with	1
carving	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
style	1
The	1
old	1
curly	1
birches	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
all	1
their	1
twigs	1
laden	1
with	1
snow	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
freshly	1
decked	1
in	1
sacred	1
vestments	1
He	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
towards	1
the	1
skating	1
ground	1
and	1
kept	1
saying	1
to	1
himself	1
You	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
excited	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
calm	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
Be	1
quiet	1
stupid	1
he	1
conjured	1
his	1
heart	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
compose	1
himself	1
the	1
more	1
breathless	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
An	1
acquaintance	1
met	1
him	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
name	1
but	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
recognize	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
mounds	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
clank	1
of	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
sledges	1
as	1
they	1
slipped	1
down	1
or	1
were	1
dragged	1
up	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
sliding	1
sledges	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
merry	1
voices	1
He	1
walked	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
skating	1
ground	1
lay	1
open	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
amidst	1
all	1
the	1
skaters	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
He	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
rapture	1
and	1
the	1
terror	1
that	1
seized	1
on	1
his	1
heart	1
She	1
was	1
standing	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
There	1
was	1
apparently	1
nothing	1
striking	1
either	1
in	1
her	1
dress	1
or	1
her	1
attitude	1
But	1
for	1
Levin	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
that	1
crowd	1
as	1
a	1
rose	1
among	1
nettles	1
Everything	1
was	1
made	1
bright	1
by	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
smile	1
that	1
shed	1
light	1
on	1
all	1
round	1
her	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
I	1
can	1
go	1
over	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
ice	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
The	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
stood	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
holy	1
shrine	1
unapproachable	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
retreating	1
so	1
overwhelmed	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
terror	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
master	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
remind	1
himself	1
that	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
were	1
moving	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
might	1
come	1
there	1
to	1
skate	1
He	1
walked	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
avoiding	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
but	1
seeing	1
her	1
as	1
one	1
does	1
the	1
sun	1
without	1
looking	1
On	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
day	1
people	1
of	1
one	1
set	1
all	1
acquainted	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
ice	1
There	1
were	1
crack	1
skaters	1
there	1
showing	1
off	1
their	1
skill	1
and	1
learners	1
clinging	1
to	1
chairs	1
with	1
timid	1
awkward	1
movements	1
boys	1
and	1
elderly	1
people	1
skating	1
with	1
hygienic	1
motives	1
They	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
an	1
elect	1
band	1
of	1
blissful	1
beings	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
here	1
near	1
her	1
All	1
the	1
skaters	1
it	1
seemed	1
with	1
perfect	1
self	1
possession	1
skated	1
towards	1
her	1
skated	1
by	1
her	1
even	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
happy	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
enjoying	1
the	1
capital	1
ice	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
weather	1
Nikolay	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
Kitty	1
s	1
cousin	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
and	1
tight	1
trousers	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
garden	1
seat	1
with	1
his	1
skates	1
on	1
Seeing	1
Levin	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
Ah	1
the	1
first	1
skater	1
in	1
Russia	1
Been	1
here	1
long	1
First	1
rate	1
ice	1
do	1
put	1
your	1
skates	1
on	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
got	1
my	1
skates	1
Levin	1
answered	1
marveling	1
at	1
this	1
boldness	1
and	1
ease	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
second	1
losing	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
coming	1
near	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
turning	1
out	1
her	1
slender	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
high	1
boots	1
with	1
obvious	1
timidity	1
she	1
skated	1
towards	1
him	1
A	1
boy	1
in	1
Russian	1
dress	1
desperately	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
overtook	1
her	1
She	1
skated	1
a	1
little	1
uncertainly	1
taking	1
her	1
hands	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
muff	1
that	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
cord	1
she	1
held	1
them	1
ready	1
for	1
emergency	1
and	1
looking	1
towards	1
Levin	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
recognized	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
fears	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
round	1
the	1
turn	1
she	1
gave	1
herself	1
a	1
push	1
off	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
skated	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
Clutching	1
at	1
his	1
arm	1
she	1
nodded	1
smiling	1
to	1
Levin	1
She	1
was	1
more	1
splendid	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
imagined	1
her	1
When	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
could	1
call	1
up	1
a	1
vivid	1
picture	1
of	1
her	1
to	1
himself	1
especially	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
that	1
little	1
fair	1
head	1
so	1
freely	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
shapely	1
girlish	1
shoulders	1
and	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
childish	1
brightness	1
and	1
good	1
humor	1
The	1
childishness	1
of	1
her	1
expression	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
delicate	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
special	1
charm	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
fully	1
realized	1
But	1
what	1
always	1
struck	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
something	1
unlooked	1
for	1
was	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
soft	1
serene	1
and	1
truthful	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
her	1
smile	1
which	1
always	1
transported	1
Levin	1
to	1
an	1
enchanted	1
world	1
where	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
softened	1
and	1
tender	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
himself	1
in	1
some	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
early	1
childhood	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
Thank	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
as	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
I	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
long	1
yesterday	1
I	1
mean	1
today	1
I	1
arrived	1
answered	1
Levin	1
in	1
his	1
emotion	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
understanding	1
her	1
question	1
I	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
then	1
recollecting	1
with	1
what	1
intention	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
promptly	1
overcome	1
with	1
confusion	1
and	1
blushed	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
could	1
skate	1
and	1
skate	1
so	1
well	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
earnestly	1
as	1
though	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
confusion	1
Your	1
praise	1
is	1
worth	1
having	1
The	1
tradition	1
is	1
kept	1
up	1
here	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
skaters	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
black	1
gloved	1
hand	1
brushing	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
hoarfrost	1
off	1
her	1
muff	1
Yes	1
I	1
used	1
once	1
to	1
skate	1
with	1
passion	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
reach	1
perfection	1
You	1
do	1
everything	1
with	1
passion	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
I	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
skate	1
Put	1
on	1
skates	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
skate	1
together	1
Skate	1
together	1
Can	1
that	1
be	1
possible	1
thought	1
Levin	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
I	1
ll	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
directly	1
he	1
said	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
get	1
skates	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
since	1
we	1
ve	1
seen	1
you	1

sir	1
said	1
the	1
attendant	1
supporting	1
his	1
foot	1
and	1
screwing	1
on	1
the	1
heel	1
of	1
the	1
skate	1
Except	1
you	1
there	1
s	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
first	1
rate	1
skaters	1
Will	1
that	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
said	1
he	1
tightening	1
the	1
strap	1
Oh	1
yes	1
yes	1
make	1
haste	1
please	1
answered	1
Levin	1
with	1
difficulty	1
restraining	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
rapture	1
which	1
would	1
overspread	1
his	1
face	1
Yes	1
he	1
thought	1
this	1
now	1
is	1
life	1
this	1
is	1
happiness	1
Together	1
	1
she	1
said	1
let	1
us	1
skate	1
together	1
	1
Speak	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
because	1
I	1
m	1
happy	1
now	1
happy	1
in	1
hope	1
anyway	1
And	1
then	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
I	1

Away	1
with	1
weakness	1
Levin	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
scurrying	1
over	1
the	1
rough	1
ice	1
round	1
the	1
hut	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
smooth	1
ice	1
and	1
skated	1
without	1
effort	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
simple	1
exercise	1
of	1
will	1
increasing	1
and	1
slackening	1
speed	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
course	1
He	1
approached	1
with	1
timidity	1
but	1
again	1
her	1
smile	1
reassured	1
him	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
off	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
going	1
faster	1
and	1
faster	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
rapidly	1
they	1
moved	1
the	1
more	1
tightly	1
she	1
grasped	1
his	1
hand	1
With	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
learn	1
I	1
somehow	1
feel	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
myself	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
leaning	1
on	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
panic	1
stricken	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
blushed	1
And	1
indeed	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
the	1
sun	1
going	1
behind	1
a	1
cloud	1
her	1
face	1
lost	1
all	1
its	1
friendliness	1
and	1
Levin	1
detected	1
the	1
familiar	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
expression	1
that	1
denoted	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
thought	1
a	1
crease	1
showed	1
on	1
her	1
smooth	1
brow	1
Is	1
there	1
anything	1
troubling	1
you	1
though	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
ask	1
such	1
a	1
question	1
he	1
added	1
hurriedly	1
Oh	1
why	1
so	1
No	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
trouble	1
me	1
she	1
responded	1
coldly	1
and	1
she	1
added	1
immediately	1
You	1
haven	1
t	1
seen	1
Mlle	1
Linon	1
have	1
you	1
Not	1
yet	1
Go	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
likes	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
What	1
s	1
wrong	1
I	1
have	1
offended	1
her	1
Lord	1
help	1
me	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
flew	1
towards	1
the	1
old	1
Frenchwoman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
ringlets	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
Smiling	1
and	1
showing	1
her	1
false	1
teeth	1
she	1
greeted	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
Yes	1
you	1
see	1
we	1
re	1
growing	1
up	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
glancing	1
towards	1
Kitty	1
and	1
growing	1
old	1
Tiny	1
bear	1
has	1
grown	1
big	1
now	1
pursued	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
laughing	1
and	1
she	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
joke	1
about	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
bears	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
nursery	1
tale	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
He	1
remembered	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
joke	1
for	1
ten	1
years	1
now	1
and	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
it	1
Now	1
go	1
and	1
skate	1
go	1
and	1
skate	1
Our	1
Kitty	1
has	1
learned	1
to	1
skate	1
nicely	1
hasn	1
t	1
she	1
When	1
Levin	1
darted	1
up	1
to	1
Kitty	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
stern	1
her	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sincerity	1
and	1
friendliness	1
but	1
Levin	1
fancied	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
friendliness	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
note	1
of	1
deliberate	1
composure	1
And	1
he	1
felt	1
depressed	1
After	1
talking	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
governess	1
and	1
her	1
peculiarities	1
she	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
life	1
Surely	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
dull	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
dull	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
busy	1
he	1
said	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
him	1
in	1
check	1
by	1
her	1
composed	1
tone	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
force	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
town	1
long	1
Kitty	1
questioned	1
him	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
he	1
answered	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
The	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
held	1
in	1
check	1
by	1
her	1
tone	1
of	1
quiet	1
friendliness	1
he	1
would	1
end	1
by	1
going	1
back	1
again	1
without	1
deciding	1
anything	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
struggle	1
against	1
it	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
It	1
depends	1
upon	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
horror	1
stricken	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
words	1
or	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
them	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
stumble	1
twice	1
struck	1
out	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
skated	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
She	1
skated	1
up	1
to	1
Mlle	1
Linon	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilion	1
where	1
the	1
ladies	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
skates	1
My	1
God	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
Merciful	1
God	1
help	1
me	1
guide	1
me	1
said	1
Levin	1
praying	1
inwardly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
feeling	1
a	1
need	1
of	1
violent	1
exercise	1
he	1
skated	1
about	1
describing	1
inner	1
and	1
outer	1
circles	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
skaters	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coffee	1
house	1
in	1
his	1
skates	1
with	1
a	1
cigarette	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
Taking	1
a	1
run	1
he	1
dashed	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
in	1
his	1
skates	1
crashing	1
and	1
bounding	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
He	1
flew	1
down	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
changing	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
skated	1
away	1
over	1
the	1
ice	1
Ah	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
trick	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
promptly	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
new	1
trick	1
Don	1
t	1
break	1
your	1
neck	1
it	1
needs	1
practice	1
Nikolay	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
shouted	1
after	1
him	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
steps	1
took	1
a	1
run	1
from	1
above	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
dashed	1
down	1
preserving	1
his	1
balance	1
in	1
this	1
unwonted	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
On	1
the	1
last	1
step	1
he	1
stumbled	1
but	1
barely	1
touching	1
the	1
ice	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
violent	1
effort	1
recovered	1
himself	1
and	1
skated	1
off	1
laughing	1
How	1
splendid	1
how	1
nice	1
he	1
is	1
Kitty	1
was	1
thinking	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pavilion	1
with	1
Mlle	1
Linon	1
and	1
looked	1
towards	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
quiet	1
affection	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
favorite	1
brother	1
And	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
my	1
fault	1
can	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
anything	1
wrong	1
They	1
talk	1
of	1
flirtation	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
jolly	1
Only	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
mused	1
Catching	1
sight	1
of	1
Kitty	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
meeting	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
Levin	1
flushed	1
from	1
his	1
rapid	1
exercise	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
pondered	1
a	1
minute	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
skates	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
Delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
On	1
Thursdays	1
we	1
are	1
home	1
as	1
always	1
Today	1
then	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
stiffly	1
This	1
stiffness	1
hurt	1
Kitty	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
coldness	1
She	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
said	1
Good	1
bye	1
till	1
this	1
evening	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
his	1
hat	1
cocked	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
beaming	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
strode	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
like	1
a	1
conquering	1
hero	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
his	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
he	1
responded	1
in	1
a	1
mournful	1
and	1
crestfallen	1
tone	1
to	1
her	1
inquiries	1
about	1
Dolly	1
s	1
health	1
After	1
a	1
little	1
subdued	1
and	1
dejected	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
he	1
threw	1
out	1
his	1
chest	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
arm	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
Well	1
shall	1
we	1
set	1
off	1
he	1
asked	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
air	1
Yes	1
come	1
along	1
answered	1
Levin	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
hearing	1
unceasingly	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
voice	1
saying	1
Good	1
bye	1
till	1
this	1
evening	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
To	1
the	1
England	1
or	1
the	1
Hermitage	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
which	1
All	1
right	1
then	1
the	1
England	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
selecting	1
that	1
restaurant	1
because	1
he	1
owed	1
more	1
there	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
Hermitage	1
and	1
consequently	1
considered	1
it	1
mean	1
to	1
avoid	1
it	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
a	1
sledge	1
That	1
s	1
first	1
rate	1
for	1
I	1
sent	1
my	1
carriage	1
home	1
The	1
friends	1
hardly	1
spoke	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
Levin	1
was	1
wondering	1
what	1
that	1
change	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
expression	1
had	1
meant	1
and	1
alternately	1
assuring	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
hope	1
and	1
falling	1
into	1
despair	1
seeing	1
clearly	1
that	1
his	1
hopes	1
were	1
insane	1
and	1
yet	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
quite	1
another	1
man	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
those	1
words	1
Good	1
bye	1
till	1
this	1
evening	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
absorbed	1
during	1
the	1
drive	1
in	1
composing	1
the	1
menu	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
You	1
like	1
turbot	1

he	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
arriving	1
Eh	1
responded	1
Levin	1
Turbot	1
Yes	1
I	1

Chapter	1

When	1
Levin	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
restaurant	1
with	1
Oblonsky	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
a	1
certain	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
expression	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
restrained	1
radiance	1
about	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Oblonsky	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
over	1
one	1
ear	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
giving	1
directions	1
to	1
the	1
Tatar	1
waiters	1
who	1
were	1
clustered	1
about	1
him	1
in	1
evening	1
coats	1
bearing	1
napkins	1
Bowing	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
here	1
as	1
everywhere	1
joyously	1
greeting	1
acquaintances	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sideboard	1
for	1
a	1
preliminary	1
appetizer	1
of	1
fish	1
and	1
vodka	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
painted	1
Frenchwoman	1
decked	1
in	1
ribbons	1
lace	1
and	1
ringlets	1
behind	1
the	1
counter	1
something	1
so	1
amusing	1
that	1
even	1
that	1
Frenchwoman	1
was	1
moved	1
to	1
genuine	1
laughter	1
Levin	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
refrained	1
from	1
taking	1
any	1
vodka	1
simply	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
a	1
loathing	1
of	1
that	1
Frenchwoman	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
it	1
seemed	1
of	1
false	1
hair	1
poudre	1
de	1
riz	1
	1
and	1
vinaigre	1
de	1
toilette	1
He	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
move	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
dirty	1
place	1
His	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
memories	1
of	1
Kitty	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
happiness	1
shining	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
This	1

behind	1
Walk	1
in	1
your	1
excellency	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
showing	1
his	1
respect	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
being	1
attentive	1
to	1
his	1
guest	1
as	1
well	1
Instantly	1
flinging	1
a	1
fresh	1
cloth	1
over	1
the	1
round	1
table	1
under	1
the	1
bronze	1
chandelier	1
though	1
it	1
already	1
had	1
a	1
table	1
cloth	1
on	1
it	1
he	1
pushed	1
up	1
velvet	1
chairs	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
before	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
napkin	1
and	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
awaiting	1
his	1
commands	1
If	1
you	1
prefer	1
it	1
your	1
excellency	1
a	1
private	1
room	1
will	1
be	1
free	1
directly	1
Prince	1

with	1
a	1
lady	1
Fresh	1
oysters	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
Ah	1
oysters	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
became	1
thoughtful	1
How	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
change	1
our	1
program	1
Levin	1
he	1
said	1
keeping	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
And	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
serious	1
hesitation	1
Are	1
the	1
oysters	1
good	1
Mind	1
now	1
They	1
re	1
Flensburg	1
your	1
excellency	1
We	1
ve	1
no	1
Ostend	1
Flensburg	1
will	1
do	1
but	1
are	1
they	1
fresh	1
Only	1
arrived	1
yesterday	1
Well	1
then	1
how	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
oysters	1
and	1
so	1
change	1
the	1
whole	1
program	1
Eh	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
cabbage	1
soup	1
and	1
porridge	1
better	1
than	1
anything	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
like	1
that	1
here	1
Porridge	1
`a	1
la	1
Russe	1
	1
your	1
honor	1
would	1
like	1
said	1
the	1
Tatar	1
bending	1
down	1
to	1
Levin	1
like	1
a	1
nurse	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
No	1
joking	1
apart	1
whatever	1
you	1
choose	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
skating	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
hungry	1
And	1
don	1
t	1
imagine	1
he	1
added	1
detecting	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
on	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
face	1
that	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
appreciate	1
your	1
choice	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
I	1
should	1
hope	1
so	1
After	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Well	1
then	1
my	1
friend	1
you	1
give	1
us	1
two	1
or	1
better	1
say	1
three	1
dozen	1
oysters	1
clear	1
soup	1
with	1
vegetables	1
Printani`ere	1
	1
prompted	1
the	1
Tatar	1
But	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
apparently	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
allow	1
him	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
giving	1
the	1
French	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
dishes	1
With	1
vegetables	1
in	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
Then	1
turbot	1
with	1
thick	1
sauce	1
then	1
roast	1
beef	1
and	1
mind	1
it	1
s	1
good	1
Yes	1
and	1
capons	1
perhaps	1
and	1
then	1
sweets	1
The	1
Tatar	1
recollecting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
way	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
dishes	1
by	1
the	1
names	1
in	1
the	1
French	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
did	1
not	1
repeat	1
them	1
after	1
him	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
rehearsing	1
the	1
whole	1
menu	1
to	1
himself	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
bill	1
Soupe	1
printani`ere	1
turbot	1
sauce	1
Beaumarchais	1
poulard	1
`a	1
l	1
estragon	1
mac'edoine	1
de	1
fruits	1
etc	1
and	1
then	1
instantly	1
as	1
though	1
worked	1
by	1
springs	1
laying	1
down	1
one	1
bound	1
bill	1
of	1
fare	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
another	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
wines	1
and	1
submitted	1
it	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink	1
What	1
you	1
like	1
only	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
Champagne	1
said	1
Levin	1
What	1
to	1
start	1
with	1
You	1
re	1
right	1
though	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
Do	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
white	1
seal	1
Cachet	1
blanc	1
	1
prompted	1
the	1
Tatar	1
Very	1
well	1
then	1
give	1
us	1
that	1
brand	1
with	1
the	1
oysters	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
ll	1
see	1
Yes	1
sir	1
And	1
what	1
table	1
wine	1
You	1
can	1
give	1
us	1
Nuits	1
Oh	1
no	1
better	1
the	1
classic	1
Chablis	1
Yes	1
sir	1
And	1
your	1
cheese	1
your	1
excellency	1
Oh	1
yes	1
Parmesan	1
Or	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
another	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
Levin	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
And	1
the	1
Tatar	1
ran	1
off	1
with	1
flying	1
coat	1
tails	1
and	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
darted	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
opened	1
oysters	1
on	1
mother	1
of	1
pearl	1
shells	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
between	1
his	1
fingers	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
crushed	1
the	1
starchy	1
napkin	1
tucked	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
settling	1
his	1
arms	1
comfortably	1
started	1
on	1
the	1
oysters	1
Not	1
bad	1
he	1
said	1
stripping	1
the	1
oysters	1
from	1
the	1
pearly	1
shell	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
fork	1
and	1
swallowing	1
them	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
Not	1
bad	1
he	1
repeated	1
turning	1
his	1
dewy	1
brilliant	1
eyes	1
from	1
Levin	1
to	1
the	1
Tatar	1
Levin	1
ate	1
the	1
oysters	1
indeed	1
though	1
white	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
would	1
have	1
pleased	1
him	1
better	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
admiring	1
Oblonsky	1
Even	1
the	1
Tatar	1
uncorking	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
pouring	1
the	1
sparkling	1
wine	1
into	1
the	1
delicate	1
glasses	1
glanced	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
settled	1
his	1
white	1
cravat	1
with	1
a	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
much	1
for	1
oysters	1
do	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
emptying	1
his	1
wine	1
glass	1
or	1
you	1
re	1
worried	1
about	1
something	1
Eh	1
He	1
wanted	1
Levin	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
With	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
he	1
felt	1
sore	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
in	1
the	1
restaurant	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
private	1
rooms	1
where	1
men	1
were	1
dining	1
with	1
ladies	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
fuss	1
and	1
bustle	1
the	1
surroundings	1
of	1
bronzes	1
looking	1
glasses	1
gas	1
and	1
waiters	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
offensive	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
sullying	1
what	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
brimful	1
of	1
I	1
Yes	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
bothers	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
conceive	1
how	1
queer	1
it	1
all	1
seems	1
to	1
a	1
country	1
person	1
like	1
me	1
as	1
queer	1
as	1
that	1
gentleman	1
s	1
nails	1
I	1
saw	1
at	1
your	1
place	1
Yes	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
interested	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
poor	1
Grinevitch	1
s	1
nails	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
It	1
s	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me	1
responded	1
Levin	1
Do	1
try	1
now	1
and	1
put	1
yourself	1
in	1
my	1
place	1
take	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
person	1
We	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
try	1
to	1
bring	1
our	1
hands	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
convenient	1
for	1
working	1
with	1
So	1
we	1
cut	1
our	1
nails	1
sometimes	1
we	1
turn	1
up	1
our	1
sleeves	1
And	1
here	1
people	1
purposely	1
let	1
their	1
nails	1
grow	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
and	1
link	1
on	1
small	1
saucers	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
studs	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
Oh	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
do	1
coarse	1
work	1
His	1
work	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
mind	1
Maybe	1
But	1
still	1
it	1
s	1
queer	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
seems	1
queer	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
country	1
folks	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
meals	1
over	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
our	1
work	1
while	1
here	1
are	1
we	1
trying	1
to	1
drag	1
out	1
our	1
meal	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
object	1
eating	1
oysters	1
Why	1
of	1
course	1
objected	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
civilization	1
to	1
make	1
everything	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
Well	1
if	1
that	1
s	1
its	1
aim	1
I	1
d	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
savage	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
savage	1
All	1
you	1
Levins	1
are	1
savages	1
Levin	1
sighed	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
and	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
and	1
sore	1
and	1
he	1
scowled	1
but	1
Oblonsky	1
began	1
speaking	1
of	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
drew	1
his	1
attention	1
Oh	1
I	1
say	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
tonight	1
to	1
our	1
people	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
I	1
mean	1
he	1
said	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkling	1
significantly	1
as	1
he	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
empty	1
rough	1
shells	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
cheese	1
towards	1
him	1
Yes	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
go	1
replied	1
Levin	1
though	1
I	1
fancied	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
warm	1
in	1
her	1
invitation	1
What	1
nonsense	1
That	1
s	1
her	1
manner	1
Come	1
boy	1
the	1
soup	1
That	1
s	1
her	1
manner	1
grande	1
dame	1
	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
m	1
coming	1
too	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Bonina	1
s	1
rehearsal	1
Come	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
savage	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
explain	1
the	1
sudden	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
vanished	1
from	1
Moscow	1
The	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
continually	1
asking	1
me	1
about	1
you	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
always	1
do	1
what	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
does	1
Yes	1
said	1
Levin	1
slowly	1
and	1
with	1
emotion	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
savage	1
Only	1
my	1
savageness	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
having	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
in	1
coming	1
now	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
Oh	1
what	1
a	1
lucky	1
fellow	1
you	1
are	1
broke	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
looking	1
into	1
Levin	1
s	1
eyes	1
Why	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
gallant	1
steed	1
by	1
tokens	1
sure	1
And	1
by	1
his	1
eyes	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
youth	1
in	1
love	1
declaimed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Everything	1
is	1
before	1
you	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
over	1
for	1
you	1
already	1
No	1
not	1
over	1
exactly	1
but	1
the	1
future	1
is	1
yours	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
is	1
mine	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
well	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
How	1
so	1
Oh	1
things	1
go	1
wrong	1
But	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
besides	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
explain	1
it	1
all	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Well	1
why	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
then	1
Hi	1
take	1
away	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
Tatar	1
You	1
guess	1
responded	1
Levin	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
deep	1
wells	1
of	1
light	1
fixed	1
on	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
guess	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
by	1
that	1
whether	1
I	1
guess	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
gazing	1
at	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
Levin	1
in	1
a	1
quivering	1
voice	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
were	1
quivering	1
too	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
slowly	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass	1
of	1
Chablis	1
never	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
Levin	1
I	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
I	1
desire	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
nothing	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
But	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
making	1
a	1
mistake	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
re	1
speaking	1
of	1
said	1
Levin	1
piercing	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
You	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
possible	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
possible	1
Why	1
not	1
possible	1
No	1
do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
possible	1
No	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
you	1
think	1
Oh	1
but	1
if	1
if	1
refusal	1
s	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
me	1
Indeed	1
I	1
feel	1
sure	1
Why	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
excitement	1
It	1
seems	1
so	1
to	1
me	1
sometimes	1
That	1
will	1
be	1
awful	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
too	1
Oh	1
well	1
anyway	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
awful	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
girl	1

of	1
an	1
offer	1
Yes	1
every	1
girl	1

not	1
she	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
He	1
so	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
that	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
were	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
classes	1
one	1
class	1
all	1
the	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
except	1
her	1
and	1
those	1
girls	1
with	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
human	1
weaknesses	1
and	1
very	1
ordinary	1
girls	1
the	1
other	1
class	1
she	1
alone	1
having	1
no	1
weaknesses	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
and	1
higher	1
than	1
all	1
humanity	1
Stay	1
take	1
some	1
sauce	1
he	1
said	1
holding	1
back	1
Levin	1
s	1
hand	1
as	1
it	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
sauce	1
Levin	1
obediently	1
helped	1
himself	1
to	1
sauce	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
dinner	1
No	1
stop	1
a	1
minute	1
stop	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
for	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
anyone	1
of	1
this	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
I	1
could	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
except	1
you	1
You	1
know	1
we	1
re	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
each	1
other	1
different	1
tastes	1
and	1
views	1
and	1
everything	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
re	1
fond	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
understand	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
I	1
like	1
you	1
awfully	1
But	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
be	1
quite	1
straightforward	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
But	1
I	1
ll	1
say	1
more	1
my	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sighed	1
remembering	1
his	1
position	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
resumed	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
gift	1
of	1
foreseeing	1
things	1
She	1
sees	1
right	1
through	1
people	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
all	1
she	1
knows	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
marriages	1
She	1
foretold	1
for	1
instance	1
that	1
Princess	1
Shahovskaya	1
would	1
marry	1
Brenteln	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
believe	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
And	1
she	1
s	1
on	1
your	1
side	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
she	1
likes	1
you	1
she	1
says	1
that	1
Kitty	1
is	1
certain	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
wife	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
Levin	1
s	1
face	1
suddenly	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
a	1
smile	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
tears	1
of	1
emotion	1
She	1
says	1
that	1
cried	1
Levin	1
I	1
always	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
exquisite	1
your	1
wife	1
There	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1
enough	1
said	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
All	1
right	1
but	1
do	1
sit	1
down	1
But	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
He	1
walked	1
with	1
his	1
firm	1
tread	1
twice	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
little	1
cage	1
of	1
a	1
room	1
blinked	1
his	1
eyelids	1
that	1
his	1
tears	1
might	1
not	1
fall	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
said	1
he	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
love	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
that	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
feeling	1
but	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
force	1
outside	1
me	1
has	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
went	1
away	1
you	1
see	1
because	1
I	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
you	1
understand	1
as	1
a	1
happiness	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
on	1
earth	1
but	1
I	1
ve	1
struggled	1
with	1
myself	1
I	1
see	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
living	1
without	1
it	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
settled	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
away	1
for	1
Ah	1
stop	1
a	1
minute	1
Ah	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
come	1
crowding	1
on	1
one	1
The	1
questions	1
one	1
must	1
ask	1
oneself	1
Listen	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
what	1
you	1
ve	1
done	1
for	1
me	1
by	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
happy	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
become	1
positively	1
hateful	1
I	1
ve	1
forgotten	1
everything	1
I	1
heard	1
today	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
s	1
here	1
I	1
had	1
even	1
forgotten	1
him	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
happy	1
too	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
madness	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
s	1
awful	1
Here	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
married	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
feeling	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
that	1
we	1
old	1
with	1
a	1
past	1
not	1
of	1
love	1
but	1
of	1
sins	1
are	1
brought	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
a	1
creature	1
pure	1
and	1
innocent	1
it	1
s	1
loathsome	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
feeling	1
oneself	1
unworthy	1
Oh	1
well	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
many	1
sins	1
on	1
your	1
conscience	1
Alas	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
Levin	1
when	1
with	1
loathing	1
I	1
go	1
over	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
shudder	1
and	1
curse	1
and	1
bitterly	1
regret	1
it	1
Yes	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
The	1
world	1
s	1
made	1
so	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
The	1
one	1
comfort	1
is	1
like	1
that	1
prayer	1
which	1
I	1
always	1
liked	1
Forgive	1
me	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
unworthiness	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
Thy	1
loving	1
kindness	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
she	1
can	1
forgive	1
me	1

Levin	1
emptied	1
his	1
glass	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
There	1

Give	1

Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
directed	1
the	1
Tatar	1
who	1
was	1
filling	1
up	1
their	1
glasses	1
and	1
fidgeting	1
round	1
them	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wanted	1
Why	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
Vronsky	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
rivals	1
Who	1
s	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
suddenly	1
transformed	1
from	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
childlike	1
ecstasy	1
which	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
admiring	1
to	1
an	1
angry	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
Vronsky	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Count	1
Kirill	1
Ivanovitch	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
specimens	1
of	1
the	1
gilded	1
youth	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
made	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
Tver	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
on	1
official	1
business	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
levy	1
of	1
recruits	1
Fearfully	1
rich	1
handsome	1
great	1
connections	1
an	1

de	1
camp	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
But	1
he	1
s	1
more	1
than	1
simply	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
as	1
I	1
ve	1
found	1
out	1
here	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
cultivated	1
man	1
too	1
and	1
very	1
intelligent	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
ll	1
make	1
his	1
mark	1
Levin	1
scowled	1
and	1
was	1
dumb	1
Well	1
he	1
turned	1
up	1
here	1
soon	1
after	1
you	1
d	1
gone	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
he	1
s	1
over	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Kitty	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
Excuse	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
said	1
Levin	1
frowning	1
gloomily	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
recollected	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
and	1
how	1
hateful	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
You	1
wait	1

bit	1
wait	1

Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
and	1
touching	1
his	1
hand	1
I	1
ve	1
told	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
I	1
repeat	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
delicate	1
and	1
tender	1
matter	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
conjecture	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
chances	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
favor	1
Levin	1
dropped	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
thing	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
pursued	1
Oblonsky	1
filling	1
up	1
his	1
glass	1
No	1

I	1
can	1

drink	1
any	1

Levin	1
pushing	1
away	1

I	1

Come	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
are	1
you	1

on	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
obviously	1
anxious	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
One	1
word	1
more	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1

in	1

form	1
and	1
God	1

you	1
Oh	1

you	1
still	1
think	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
some	1
shooting	1
Come	1
next	1
spring	1
do	1
said	1
Levin	1
Now	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
remorse	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
this	1
conversation	1
with	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
A	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
was	1
profaned	1
by	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
rivalry	1
of	1
some	1
Petersburg	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suppositions	1
and	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
He	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
soul	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
some	1
day	1

said	1
But	1

pivot	1
everything	1

upon	1
Things	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
with	1
me	1
very	1
bad	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
through	1
women	1
Tell	1
me	1
frankly	1
now	1
he	1
pursued	1
picking	1
up	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
keeping	1
one	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
glass	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
advice	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
Suppose	1
you	1
re	1
married	1
you	1
love	1
your	1
wife	1
but	1
you	1
re	1
fascinated	1
by	1
another	1
woman	1
Excuse	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
absolutely	1
unable	1
to	1
comprehend	1
how	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
comprehend	1
how	1
I	1
could	1
now	1
after	1
my	1
dinner	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
a	1
baker	1
s	1
shop	1
and	1
steal	1
a	1
roll	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
Why	1
not	1
A	1
roll	1
will	1
sometimes	1
smell	1
so	1
good	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
resist	1

Himmlisch	1

Plaisir	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
subtly	1
Levin	1
too	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
but	1
joking	1
apart	1
resumed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
gentle	1
loving	1
creature	1
poor	1
and	1
lonely	1
and	1
has	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
thing	1
s	1
done	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
see	1
can	1
one	1
possibly	1
cast	1
her	1
off	1
Even	1
supposing	1
one	1
parts	1
from	1
her	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
one	1
s	1
family	1
life	1
still	1
can	1
one	1
help	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
setting	1
her	1
on	1
her	1
feet	1
softening	1
her	1
lot	1
Well	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
there	1
You	1
know	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
women	1
are	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
classes	1
at	1
least	1
no	1
truer	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
are	1
women	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
I	1
ve	1
never	1
seen	1
exquisite	1
fallen	1
beings	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
but	1
such	1
creatures	1
as	1
that	1
painted	1
Frenchwoman	1
at	1
the	1
counter	1
with	1
the	1
ringlets	1
are	1
vermin	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
all	1
fallen	1
women	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
But	1
the	1
Magdalen	1
Ah	1
drop	1
that	1
Christ	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
said	1
those	1
words	1
if	1
He	1
had	1
known	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
abused	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
Gospel	1
those	1
words	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
remembered	1
However	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
saying	1
so	1
much	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
as	1
what	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
loathing	1
for	1
fallen	1
women	1
You	1
re	1
afraid	1
of	1
spiders	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
these	1
vermin	1
Most	1
likely	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
made	1
a	1
study	1
of	1
spiders	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
their	1
character	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
that	1
gentleman	1
in	1
Dickens	1
who	1
used	1

Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
with	1
weary	1
despair	1
Levin	1
half	1
smiled	1
Yes	1
you	1

Oblonsky	1
But	1
what	1
s	1

be	1
done	1
Don	1

Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughed	1
outright	1
Oh	1
moralist	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
women	1
one	1
insists	1
only	1
on	1
her	1
rights	1
and	1
those	1
rights	1
are	1
your	1
love	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
give	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
sacrifices	1
everything	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
asks	1
for	1
nothing	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
act	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
fearful	1
tragedy	1
in	1
it	1
If	1
you	1
care	1
for	1
my	1
profession	1
of	1
faith	1
as	1
regards	1
that	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
tragedy	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
why	1
To	1
my	1
mind	1
love	1
both	1
the	1
sorts	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
you	1
remember	1
Plato	1
defines	1
in	1
his	1
Banquet	1
served	1
as	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
men	1
Some	1
men	1
only	1
understand	1
one	1
sort	1
and	1
some	1
only	1
the	1
other	1
And	1
those	1
who	1
only	1
know	1
the	1
non	1
platonic	1
love	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
tragedy	1
In	1
such	1
love	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
tragedy	1
I	1
m	1
much	1
obliged	1
for	1
the	1
gratification	1
my	1
humble	1
respects	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
tragedy	1
And	1
in	1
platonic	1
love	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
tragedy	1
because	1
in	1
that	1
love	1
all	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
pure	1
because	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
Levin	1
recollected	1
his	1
own	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
inner	1
conflict	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
And	1
he	1
added	1
unexpectedly	1
But	1
perhaps	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
Very	1
likely	1
I	1
don	1

That	1

You	1

of	1
a	1

but	1
that	1

You	1

Levin	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
Oblonsky	1
And	1
suddenly	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
felt	1
that	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
friends	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
dining	1
and	1
drinking	1
together	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
drawn	1
them	1
closer	1
yet	1
each	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
experienced	1
this	1
extreme	1
sense	1
of	1
aloofness	1
instead	1
of	1
intimacy	1
coming	1
on	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
Bill	1
he	1
called	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
promptly	1
came	1
across	1
an	1
aide	1
de	1
camp	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
an	1
actress	1
and	1
her	1
protector	1
And	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
aide	1
de	1
camp	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relaxation	1
and	1
relief	1
after	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
Levin	1
which	1
always	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
mental	1
and	1
spiritual	1
strain	1
When	1
the	1
Tatar	1
appeared	1
with	1
a	1
bill	1
for	1
twenty	1
six	1
roubles	1
and	1
odd	1
kopecks	1
besides	1
a	1
tip	1
for	1
himself	1
Levin	1
who	1
would	1
another	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
horrified	1
like	1
anyone	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
fourteen	1
roubles	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
it	1
paid	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
homewards	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
there	1
to	1
decide	1
his	1
fate	1
Chapter	1
12	1
The	1
young	1
Princess	1
Kitty	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
was	1
eighteen	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
winter	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
Her	1
success	1
in	1
society	1
had	1
been	1
greater	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
elder	1
sisters	1
and	1
greater	1
even	1
than	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
anticipated	1
To	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
danced	1
at	1
the	1
Moscow	1
balls	1
being	1
almost	1
all	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Kitty	1
two	1
serious	1
suitors	1
had	1
already	1
this	1
first	1
winter	1
made	1
their	1
appearance	1
Levin	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
his	1
departure	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
Levin	1
s	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
his	1
frequent	1
visits	1
and	1
evident	1
love	1
for	1
Kitty	1
had	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
serious	1
conversations	1
between	1
Kitty	1
s	1
parents	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
future	1
and	1
to	1
disputes	1
between	1
them	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
on	1
Levin	1
s	1
side	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
better	1
for	1
Kitty	1
The	1
princess	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
going	1
round	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
peculiar	1
to	1
women	1
maintained	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
too	1
young	1
that	1
Levin	1
had	1
done	1
nothing	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
serious	1
intentions	1
that	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
no	1
great	1
attraction	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
other	1
side	1
issues	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
state	1
the	1
principal	1
point	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
her	1
liking	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
When	1
Levin	1
had	1
abruptly	1
departed	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
delighted	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
triumphantly	1
You	1
see	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
delighted	1
confirmed	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
not	1
simply	1
a	1
good	1
but	1
a	1
brilliant	1
match	1
In	1
the	1
mother	1
s	1
eyes	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
comparison	1
between	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Levin	1
She	1
disliked	1
in	1
Levin	1
his	1
strange	1
and	1
uncompromising	1
opinions	1
and	1
his	1
shyness	1
in	1
society	1
founded	1
as	1
she	1
supposed	1
on	1
his	1
pride	1
and	1
his	1
queer	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
absorbed	1
in	1
cattle	1
and	1
peasants	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
kept	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
six	1
weeks	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
something	1
inspecting	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
doing	1
them	1
too	1
great	1
an	1
honor	1
by	1
making	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
continually	1
visits	1
at	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
young	1
unmarried	1
girl	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
intentions	1
clear	1
And	1
suddenly	1
without	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
disappeared	1
It	1
s	1
as	1
well	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
attractive	1
enough	1
for	1
Kitty	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
thought	1
the	1
mother	1
Vronsky	1
satisfied	1
all	1
the	1
mother	1
s	1
desires	1
Very	1
wealthy	1
clever	1
of	1
aristocratic	1
family	1
on	1
the	1
highroad	1
to	1
a	1
brilliant	1
career	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
at	1
court	1
and	1
a	1
fascinating	1
man	1
Nothing	1
better	1
could	1
be	1
wished	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
openly	1
flirted	1
with	1
Kitty	1
at	1
balls	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
came	1
continually	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
consequently	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
his	1
intentions	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
winter	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
terrible	1
anxiety	1
and	1
agitation	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
had	1
herself	1
been	1
married	1
thirty	1
years	1
ago	1
her	1
aunt	1
arranging	1
the	1
match	1
Her	1
husband	1
about	1
whom	1
everything	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
beforehand	1
had	1
come	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
future	1
bride	1
and	1
been	1
looked	1
at	1
The	1
matchmaking	1
aunt	1
had	1
ascertained	1
and	1
communicated	1
their	1
mutual	1
impression	1
That	1
impression	1
had	1
been	1
favorable	1
Afterwards	1
on	1
a	1
day	1
fixed	1
beforehand	1
the	1
expected	1
offer	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
her	1
parents	1
and	1
accepted	1
All	1
had	1
passed	1
very	1
simply	1
and	1
easily	1
So	1
it	1
seemed	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
But	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
daughters	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
how	1
far	1
from	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
is	1
the	1
business	1
apparently	1
so	1
commonplace	1
of	1
marrying	1
off	1
one	1
s	1
daughters	1
The	1
panics	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
lived	1
through	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brooded	1
over	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
wasted	1
and	1
the	1
disputes	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
over	1
marrying	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
girls	1
Darya	1
and	1
Natalia	1
Now	1
since	1
the	1
youngest	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
terrors	1
the	1
same	1
doubts	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
violent	1
quarrels	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
over	1
the	1
elder	1
girls	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
like	1
all	1
fathers	1
indeed	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
punctilious	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
the	1
honor	1
and	1
reputation	1
of	1
his	1
daughters	1
He	1
was	1
irrationally	1
jealous	1
over	1
his	1
daughters	1
especially	1
over	1
Kitty	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
favorite	1
At	1
every	1
turn	1
he	1
had	1
scenes	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
for	1
compromising	1
her	1
daughter	1
The	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
already	1
with	1
her	1
other	1
daughters	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
ground	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
touchiness	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
much	1
was	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
society	1
that	1
a	1
mother	1
s	1
duties	1
had	1
become	1
still	1
more	1
difficult	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
girls	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
age	1
formed	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
clubs	1
went	1
to	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
lectures	1
mixed	1
freely	1
in	1
men	1
s	1
society	1
drove	1
about	1
the	1
streets	1
alone	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
did	1
not	1
curtsey	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
thing	1
all	1
the	1
girls	1
were	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
husbands	1
was	1
their	1
own	1
affair	1
and	1
not	1
their	1
parents	1
Marriages	1
aren	1
t	1
made	1
nowadays	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
was	1
thought	1
and	1
said	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
young	1
girls	1
and	1
even	1
by	1
their	1
elders	1
But	1
how	1
marriages	1
were	1
made	1
now	1
the	1
princess	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
from	1
anyone	1
The	1
French	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
parents	1
arranging	1
their	1
children	1
s	1
future	1
was	1
not	1
accepted	1
it	1
was	1
condemned	1
The	1
English	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
independence	1
of	1
girls	1
was	1
also	1
not	1
accepted	1
and	1
not	1
possible	1
in	1
Russian	1
society	1
The	1
Russian	1
fashion	1
of	1
matchmaking	1
by	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
intermediate	1
persons	1
was	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
considered	1
unseemly	1
it	1
was	1
ridiculed	1
by	1
everyone	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
princess	1
herself	1
But	1
how	1
girls	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
and	1
how	1
parents	1
were	1
to	1
marry	1
them	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
Everyone	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
matter	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
Mercy	1
on	1
us	1
it	1
s	1
high	1
time	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
to	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
that	1
old	1
fashioned	1
business	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
have	1
to	1
marry	1
and	1
not	1
their	1
parents	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
to	1
arrange	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
choose	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
easy	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
daughters	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
realized	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
her	1
daughter	1
might	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
someone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
or	1
who	1
was	1
quite	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
And	1
however	1
much	1
it	1
was	1
instilled	1
into	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
times	1
young	1
people	1
ought	1
to	1
arrange	1
their	1
lives	1
for	1
themselves	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
whatever	1
the	1
most	1
suitable	1
playthings	1
for	1
children	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
loaded	1
pistols	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
more	1
uneasy	1
over	1
Kitty	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
over	1
her	1
elder	1
sisters	1
Now	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
might	1
confine	1
himself	1
to	1
simply	1
flirting	1
with	1
her	1
daughter	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
honorable	1
man	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
knew	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
manners	1
of	1
today	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
girl	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
how	1
lightly	1
men	1
generally	1
regard	1
such	1
a	1
crime	1
The	1
week	1
before	1
Kitty	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
she	1
had	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
during	1
a	1
mazurka	1
This	1
conversation	1
had	1
partly	1
reassured	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
perfectly	1
at	1
ease	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
told	1
Kitty	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
were	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
obeying	1
their	1
mother	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
to	1
any	1
important	1
undertaking	1
without	1
consulting	1
her	1
And	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
impatiently	1
awaiting	1
my	1
mother	1
s	1
arrival	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
peculiarly	1
fortunate	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
Kitty	1
had	1
repeated	1
this	1
without	1
attaching	1
any	1
significance	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
But	1
her	1
mother	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
light	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
was	1
expected	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
pleased	1
at	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
choice	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
his	1
offer	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
vexing	1
his	1
mother	1
However	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
itself	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
for	1
relief	1
from	1
her	1
fears	1
that	1
she	1
believed	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
Bitter	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
unhappiness	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
Dolly	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
leaving	1
her	1
husband	1
her	1
anxiety	1
over	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
her	1
youngest	1
daughter	1
s	1
fate	1
engrossed	1
all	1
her	1
feelings	1
Today	1
with	1
Levin	1
s	1
reappearance	1
a	1
fresh	1
source	1
of	1
anxiety	1
arose	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
as	1
she	1
fancied	1
a	1
feeling	1
for	1
Levin	1
might	1
from	1
extreme	1
sense	1
of	1
honor	1
refuse	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
that	1
Levin	1
s	1
arrival	1
might	1
generally	1
complicate	1
and	1
delay	1
the	1
affair	1
so	1
near	1
being	1
concluded	1
Why	1
has	1
he	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
the	1
princess	1
asked	1
about	1
Levin	1
as	1
they	1
returned	1
home	1
He	1
came	1
today	1
mamma	1
There	1
s	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
began	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
serious	1
and	1
alert	1
face	1
Kitty	1
guessed	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
Mamma	1
she	1
said	1
flushing	1
hotly	1
and	1
turning	1
quickly	1
to	1
her	1
please	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
anything	1
about	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
She	1
wished	1
for	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
wished	1
for	1
but	1
the	1
motives	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
wishes	1
wounded	1
her	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
raise	1
hopes	1
Mamma	1
darling	1
for	1
goodness	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
horrible	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
seeing	1
the	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
eyes	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
my	1
love	1
you	1
promised	1
me	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
secrets	1
from	1
me	1
You	1

Never	1

Kitty	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
looking	1
her	1
mother	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
no	1

in	1
my	1

you	1
anything	1

I	1
I	1

I	1

I	1

No	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
an	1
untruth	1
with	1
those	1
eyes	1
thought	1
the	1
mother	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
agitation	1
and	1
happiness	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
just	1
now	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
child	1
so	1
immense	1
and	1
so	1
important	1
Chapter	1
13	1
After	1
dinner	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
Kitty	1
was	1
feeling	1
a	1
sensation	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
before	1
a	1
battle	1
Her	1
heart	1
throbbed	1
violently	1
and	1
her	1
thoughts	1
would	1
not	1
rest	1
on	1
anything	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
evening	1
when	1
they	1
would	1
both	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
turning	1
point	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
continually	1
picturing	1
them	1
to	1
herself	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
each	1
separately	1
and	1
then	1
both	1
together	1
When	1
she	1
mused	1
on	1
the	1
past	1
she	1
dwelt	1
with	1
pleasure	1
with	1
tenderness	1
on	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Levin	1
The	1
memories	1
of	1
childhood	1
and	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
friendship	1
with	1
her	1
dead	1
brother	1
gave	1
a	1
special	1
poetic	1
charm	1
to	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
His	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
certain	1
was	1
flattering	1
and	1
delightful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Levin	1
In	1
her	1
memories	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
there	1
always	1
entered	1
a	1
certain	1
element	1
of	1
awkwardness	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
well	1
bred	1
and	1
at	1
ease	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
false	1
note	1
not	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
nice	1
but	1
in	1
herself	1
while	1
with	1
Levin	1
she	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
simple	1
and	1
clear	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
directly	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
there	1
arose	1
before	1
her	1
a	1
perspective	1
of	1
brilliant	1
happiness	1
with	1
Levin	1
the	1
future	1
seemed	1
misty	1
When	1
she	1
went	1
upstairs	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
she	1
noticed	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
forces	1
she	1
needed	1
this	1
so	1
for	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
external	1
composure	1
and	1
free	1
grace	1
in	1
her	1
movements	1
At	1
half	1
past	1
seven	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
the	1
footman	1
announced	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Levin	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
seemed	1
to	1
rush	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
She	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
her	1
paleness	1
as	1
she	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
knew	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
early	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
alone	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
And	1
only	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
presented	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
different	1
aspect	1
only	1
then	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
her	1
only	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
that	1
moment	1
to	1
wound	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
liked	1
And	1
to	1
wound	1
him	1
cruelly	1
What	1
for	1
Because	1
he	1
dear	1
fellow	1
loved	1
her	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
My	1
God	1
shall	1
I	1
myself	1
really	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
thought	1
Can	1
I	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
him	1
That	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lie	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
That	1
I	1
love	1
someone	1
else	1
No	1
that	1
s	1
impossible	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
away	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
away	1
She	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
step	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
honest	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
will	1
be	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
And	1
with	1
him	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
seeing	1
his	1
powerful	1
shy	1
figure	1
with	1
his	1
shining	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
She	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
though	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
time	1
yet	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
m	1
too	1
early	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
round	1
the	1
empty	1
drawing	1
room	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
expectations	1
were	1
realized	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
speaking	1
his	1
face	1
became	1
gloomy	1
Oh	1
no	1
said	1
Kitty	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
alone	1
he	1
began	1
not	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
courage	1
Mamma	1
will	1
be	1
down	1
directly	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
tired	1
Yesterday	1
She	1
talked	1
on	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
uttering	1
and	1
not	1
taking	1
her	1
supplicating	1
and	1
caressing	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
she	1
blushed	1
and	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
here	1
long	1
that	1
it	1
depended	1
on	1
you	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
head	1
lower	1
and	1
lower	1
not	1
knowing	1
herself	1
what	1
answer	1
she	1
should	1
make	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
coming	1
That	1
it	1
depended	1
on	1
you	1
he	1
repeated	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
came	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
wife	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
but	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
thing	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
feeling	1
ecstasy	1
Her	1
soul	1
was	1
flooded	1
with	1
happiness	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
anticipated	1
that	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
love	1
would	1
produce	1
such	1
a	1
powerful	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
But	1
it	1
lasted	1
only	1
an	1
instant	1
She	1
remembered	1
Vronsky	1
She	1
lifted	1
her	1
clear	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
and	1
seeing	1
his	1
desperate	1
face	1
she	1
answered	1
hastily	1
That	1
cannot	1
be	1
forgive	1
me	1
A	1
moment	1
ago	1
and	1
how	1
close	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
And	1
how	1
aloof	1
and	1
remote	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
now	1
It	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
He	1
bowed	1
and	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
retreat	1
Chapter	1
14	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
in	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
horror	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
them	1
alone	1
and	1
their	1
disturbed	1
faces	1
Levin	1
bowed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
nor	1
lift	1
her	1
eyes	1
Thank	1
God	1
she	1
has	1
refused	1
him	1
thought	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
habitual	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
greeted	1
her	1
guests	1
on	1
Thursdays	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
Levin	1
about	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
waiting	1
for	1
other	1
visitors	1
to	1
arrive	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
retreat	1
unnoticed	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
married	1
the	1
preceding	1
winter	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
thin	1
sallow	1
sickly	1
and	1
nervous	1
woman	1
with	1
brilliant	1
black	1
eyes	1
She	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
Kitty	1
and	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
showed	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
married	1
women	1
for	1
girls	1
always	1
does	1
in	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
Kitty	1
after	1
her	1
own	1
ideal	1
of	1
married	1
happiness	1
she	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
Vronsky	1
Levin	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
disliked	1
him	1
Her	1
invariable	1
and	1
favorite	1
pursuit	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
consisted	1
in	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
do	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
looks	1
down	1
at	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
grandeur	1
or	1
breaks	1
off	1
his	1
learned	1
conversation	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
fool	1
or	1
is	1
condescending	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
like	1
that	1
so	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
condescending	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
me	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
right	1
for	1
Levin	1
actually	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
her	1
and	1
despised	1
her	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
and	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
fine	1
characteristic	1
her	1
nervousness	1
her	1
delicate	1
contempt	1
and	1
indifference	1
for	1
everything	1
coarse	1
and	1
earthly	1
The	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
and	1
Levin	1
got	1
into	1
that	1
relation	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
not	1
seldom	1
seen	1
in	1
society	1
when	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
remain	1
externally	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
despise	1
each	1
other	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
even	1
take	1
each	1
other	1
seriously	1
and	1
cannot	1
even	1
be	1
offended	1
by	1
each	1
other	1
The	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
pounced	1
upon	1
Levin	1
at	1
once	1
Ah	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
So	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
corrupt	1
Babylon	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
him	1
her	1
tiny	1
yellow	1
hand	1
and	1
recalling	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
say	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
that	1
Moscow	1
was	1
a	1
Babylon	1
Come	1
is	1
Babylon	1
reformed	1
or	1
have	1
you	1
degenerated	1
she	1
added	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
simper	1
at	1
Kitty	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
flattering	1
for	1
me	1
countess	1
that	1
you	1
remember	1
my	1
words	1
so	1
well	1
responded	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
recovering	1
his	1
composure	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
habit	1
dropped	1
into	1
his	1
tone	1
of	1
joking	1
hostility	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
They	1
must	1
certainly	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
impression	1
on	1
you	1
Oh	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
so	1
I	1
always	1
note	1
them	1
all	1
down	1
Well	1
Kitty	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
skating	1
again	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Awkward	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Levin	1
to	1
withdraw	1
now	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
easier	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
perpetrate	1
this	1
awkwardness	1
than	1
to	1
remain	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
see	1
Kitty	1
who	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
avoided	1
his	1
eyes	1
He	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
getting	1
up	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
addressed	1
him	1
Shall	1
you	1
be	1
long	1
in	1
Moscow	1
You	1
re	1
busy	1
with	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
though	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
away	1
for	1
long	1
No	1
princess	1
I	1
m	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
There	1
s	1
something	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
thought	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
stern	1
serious	1
face	1
He	1
isn	1
t	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
argumentative	1
mood	1
But	1
I	1
ll	1
draw	1
him	1
out	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
making	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
him	1
before	1
Kitty	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
do	1
explain	1
to	1
me	1
please	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
You	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
such	1
things	1
At	1
home	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
of	1
Kaluga	1
all	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
have	1
drunk	1
up	1
all	1
they	1
possessed	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
can	1
t	1
pay	1
us	1
any	1
rent	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
You	1
always	1
praise	1
the	1
peasants	1
so	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
another	1
lady	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
Excuse	1
me	1
countess	1
but	1
I	1
really	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
anything	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
behind	1
the	1
lady	1
That	1
must	1
be	1
Vronsky	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
it	1
glanced	1
at	1
Kitty	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Levin	1
And	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
grew	1
unconsciously	1
brighter	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
that	1
man	1
knew	1
it	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
so	1
in	1
words	1
But	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
he	1
Now	1
whether	1
for	1
good	1
or	1
for	1
ill	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
choose	1
but	1
remain	1
he	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
like	1
whom	1
she	1
loved	1
There	1
are	1
people	1
who	1
on	1
meeting	1
a	1
successful	1
rival	1
no	1
matter	1
in	1
what	1
are	1
at	1
once	1
disposed	1
to	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
on	1
everything	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
only	1
what	1
is	1
bad	1
There	1
are	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
who	1
desire	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
that	1
lucky	1
rival	1
the	1
qualities	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
outstripped	1
them	1
and	1
seek	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
ache	1
at	1
heart	1
only	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
Levin	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
attractive	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
It	1
was	1
apparent	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
a	1
squarely	1
built	1
dark	1
man	1
not	1
very	1
tall	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
handsome	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
calm	1
and	1
resolute	1
face	1
Everything	1
about	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
from	1
his	1
short	1
cropped	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
freshly	1
shaven	1
chin	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
loosely	1
fitting	1
brand	1
new	1
uniform	1
was	1
simple	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
elegant	1
Making	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
Kitty	1
As	1
he	1
approached	1
her	1
his	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
specially	1
tender	1
light	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
happy	1
and	1
modestly	1
triumphant	1
smile	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
bowing	1
carefully	1
and	1
respectfully	1
over	1
her	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
small	1
broad	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
Greeting	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
everyone	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
without	1
once	1
glancing	1
at	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
taken	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
indicating	1
Levin	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Levin	1
Count	1
Alexey	1
Kirillovitch	1
Vronsky	1
Vronsky	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
cordially	1
at	1
Levin	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
dined	1
with	1
you	1
this	1
winter	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
his	1
simple	1
and	1
open	1
smile	1
but	1
you	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
left	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
despises	1
and	1
hates	1
town	1
and	1
us	1
townspeople	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
My	1
words	1
must	1
make	1
a	1
deep	1
impression	1
on	1
you	1
since	1
you	1
remember	1
them	1
so	1
well	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
suddenly	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
before	1
he	1
reddened	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
at	1
Levin	1
and	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
and	1
smiled	1
Are	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
inquired	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
dull	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
dull	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
besides	1
one	1
s	1
not	1
dull	1
by	1
oneself	1
Levin	1
replied	1
abruptly	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
noticing	1
and	1
affecting	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
Levin	1
s	1
tone	1
But	1
I	1
hope	1
count	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
always	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
tried	1
for	1
long	1
I	1
experienced	1
a	1
queer	1
feeling	1
once	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
never	1
longed	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
Russian	1
country	1
with	1
bast	1
shoes	1
and	1
peasants	1
as	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
spending	1
a	1
winter	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
in	1
Nice	1
Nice	1
itself	1
is	1
dull	1
enough	1
you	1
know	1
And	1
indeed	1
Naples	1
and	1
Sorrento	1
are	1
only	1
pleasant	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
there	1
that	1
Russia	1
comes	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
most	1
vividly	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
country	1
It	1
s	1
as	1
though	1
He	1
talked	1
on	1
addressing	1
both	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Levin	1
turning	1
his	1
serene	1
friendly	1
eyes	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
saying	1
obviously	1
just	1
what	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
Noticing	1
that	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
without	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
conversation	1
did	1
not	1
flag	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
always	1
kept	1
in	1
reserve	1
in	1
case	1
a	1
subject	1
should	1
be	1
lacking	1
two	1
heavy	1
guns	1
the	1
relative	1
advantages	1
of	1
classical	1
and	1
of	1
modern	1
education	1
and	1
universal	1
military	1
service	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
move	1
out	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
while	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
chaffing	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
wanted	1
to	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
saying	1
to	1
himself	1
every	1
instant	1
Now	1
go	1
he	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
as	1
though	1
waiting	1
for	1
something	1
The	1
conversation	1
fell	1
upon	1
table	1
turning	1
and	1
spirits	1
and	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
who	1
believed	1
in	1
spiritualism	1
began	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
marvels	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Ah	1
countess	1
you	1
really	1
must	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
pity	1
s	1
sake	1
do	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
extraordinary	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
it	1
everywhere	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
Very	1
well	1
next	1
Saturday	1
answered	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
But	1
you	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
asked	1
Levin	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
But	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
opinion	1
My	1
opinion	1
answered	1
Levin	1
is	1
only	1
that	1
this	1
table	1
turning	1
simply	1
proves	1
that	1
educated	1
society	1
so	1
called	1
is	1
no	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
peasants	1
They	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
eye	1
and	1
in	1
witchcraft	1
and	1
omens	1
while	1
we	1
Oh	1
then	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
countess	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
it	1
myself	1
The	1
peasant	1
women	1
too	1
tell	1
us	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
goblins	1
Then	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
And	1
she	1
laughed	1
a	1
mirthless	1
laugh	1
Oh	1
no	1
Masha	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
it	1
said	1
Kitty	1
blushing	1
for	1
Levin	1
and	1
Levin	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
exasperated	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
his	1
bright	1
frank	1
smile	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
was	1
threatening	1
to	1
become	1
disagreeable	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
conceivability	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
queried	1
But	1
why	1
not	1
We	1
admit	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
electricity	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
nothing	1
Why	1
should	1
there	1
not	1
be	1
some	1
new	1
force	1
still	1
unknown	1
to	1
us	1
which	1
When	1
electricity	1
was	1
discovered	1
Levin	1
interrupted	1
hurriedly	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
phenomenon	1
that	1
was	1
discovered	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
unknown	1
from	1
what	1
it	1
proceeded	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
its	1
effects	1
and	1
ages	1
passed	1
before	1
its	1
applications	1
were	1
conceived	1
But	1
the	1
spiritualists	1
have	1
begun	1
with	1
tables	1
writing	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
spirits	1
appearing	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
later	1
started	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unknown	1
force	1
Vronsky	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
Levin	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
listen	1
obviously	1
interested	1
in	1
his	1
words	1
Yes	1
but	1
the	1
spiritualists	1
say	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
at	1
present	1
what	1
this	1
force	1
is	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
force	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
conditions	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
acts	1
Let	1
the	1
scientific	1
men	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
force	1
consists	1
in	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
why	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
force	1
if	1
it	1
Why	1
because	1
with	1
electricity	1
Levin	1
interrupted	1
again	1
every	1
time	1
you	1
rub	1
tar	1
against	1
wool	1
a	1
recognized	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
manifested	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
happen	1
every	1
time	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
follows	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
natural	1
phenomenon	1
Feeling	1
probably	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
tone	1
too	1
serious	1
for	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
Vronsky	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
but	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
trying	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
smiled	1
brightly	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
Do	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
at	1
once	1
countess	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
Levin	1
would	1
finish	1
saying	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
this	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
spiritualists	1
to	1
explain	1
their	1
marvels	1
as	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
new	1
natural	1
force	1
is	1
most	1
futile	1
They	1
boldly	1
talk	1
of	1
spiritual	1
force	1
and	1
then	1
try	1
to	1
subject	1
it	1
to	1
material	1
experiment	1
Everyone	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
finish	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
And	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
medium	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
you	1
Levin	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
reddened	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
Do	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
table	1
turning	1
at	1
once	1
please	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Princess	1
will	1
you	1
allow	1
it	1
And	1
Vronsky	1
stood	1
up	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
Kitty	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
fetch	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
her	1
eyes	1
met	1
Levin	1
s	1
She	1
felt	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
heart	1
the	1
more	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
pitying	1
him	1
for	1
suffering	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
the	1
cause	1
If	1
you	1
can	1
forgive	1
me	1
forgive	1
me	1
said	1
her	1
eyes	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
I	1
hate	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
myself	1
his	1
eyes	1
responded	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
hat	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
destined	1
to	1
escape	1
Just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
arranging	1
themselves	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
retiring	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
after	1
greeting	1
the	1
ladies	1
addressed	1
Levin	1
Ah	1
he	1
began	1
joyously	1
Been	1
here	1
long	1
my	1
boy	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
town	1
Very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
embraced	1
Levin	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
serenely	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
prince	1
should	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
how	1
distasteful	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
warmth	1
was	1
to	1
Levin	1
after	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
She	1
saw	1
too	1
how	1
coldly	1
her	1
father	1
responded	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
bow	1
and	1
how	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
with	1
amiable	1
perplexity	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
and	1
failing	1
to	1
understand	1
how	1
and	1
why	1
anyone	1
could	1
be	1
hostilely	1
disposed	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
flushed	1
Prince	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
an	1
experiment	1
What	1
experiment	1
Table	1
turning	1
Well	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
but	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
fun	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
ring	1
game	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
looking	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
guessing	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
suggestion	1
There	1
s	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
that	1
anyway	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
wonderingly	1
at	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
his	1
resolute	1
eyes	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
began	1
immediately	1
talking	1
to	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
ball	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
off	1
next	1
week	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Kitty	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
unnoticed	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
impression	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
the	1
smiling	1
happy	1
face	1
of	1
Kitty	1
answering	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
inquiry	1
about	1
the	1
ball	1
Chapter	1
15	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
Kitty	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
of	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
Levin	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pity	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
Levin	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
an	1
offer	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
acted	1
rightly	1
But	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
One	1
impression	1
pursued	1
her	1
relentlessly	1
It	1
was	1
Levin	1
s	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
scowling	1
brows	1
and	1
his	1
kind	1
eyes	1
looking	1
out	1
in	1
dark	1
dejection	1
below	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
And	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
But	1
immediately	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
for	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
She	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
his	1
manly	1
resolute	1
face	1
his	1
noble	1
self	1
possession	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
nature	1
conspicuous	1
in	1
everything	1
towards	1
everyone	1
She	1
remembered	1
the	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
all	1
was	1
gladness	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
smiling	1
with	1
happiness	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
but	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
but	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
her	1
something	1
else	1
Whether	1
she	1
felt	1
remorse	1
at	1
having	1
won	1
Levin	1
s	1
love	1
or	1
at	1
having	1
refused	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
But	1
her	1
happiness	1
was	1
poisoned	1
by	1
doubts	1
Lord	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
us	1
Lord	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
us	1
Lord	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
us	1
she	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
till	1
she	1
fell	1
asleep	1
Meanwhile	1
there	1
took	1
place	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
little	1
library	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
scenes	1
so	1
often	1
repeated	1
between	1
the	1
parents	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
favorite	1
daughter	1
What	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
wrapping	1
his	1
squirrel	1
lined	1
dressing	1
gown	1
round	1
him	1
again	1
That	1
you	1
ve	1
no	1
pride	1
no	1
dignity	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
disgracing	1
ruining	1
your	1
daughter	1
by	1
this	1
vulgar	1
stupid	1
matchmaking	1
But	1
really	1
for	1
mercy	1
s	1
sake	1
prince	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
almost	1
crying	1
She	1
pleased	1
and	1
happy	1
after	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
night	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
offer	1
and	1
Kitty	1
s	1
refusal	1
still	1
she	1
hinted	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
she	1
fancied	1
things	1
were	1
practically	1
settled	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
declare	1
himself	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
arrived	1
And	1
thereupon	1
at	1
those	1
words	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
flown	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
use	1
unseemly	1
language	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
re	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
an	1
eligible	1
gentleman	1
and	1
all	1
Moscow	1
will	1
be	1
talking	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
good	1
reason	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
evening	1
parties	1
invite	1
everyone	1
don	1
t	1
pick	1
out	1
the	1
possible	1
suitors	1
Invite	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
bucks	1
Engage	1
a	1
piano	1
player	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
dance	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
things	1
nowadays	1
hunting	1
up	1
good	1
matches	1
It	1
makes	1
me	1
sick	1
sick	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
ve	1
gone	1
on	1
till	1
you	1
ve	1
turned	1
the	1
poor	1
wench	1
s	1
head	1
Levin	1
s	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
the	1
better	1
man	1
As	1
for	1
this	1
little	1
Petersburg	1
swell	1
they	1
re	1
turned	1
out	1
by	1
machinery	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
pattern	1
and	1
all	1
precious	1
rubbish	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
my	1
daughter	1
need	1
not	1
run	1
after	1
anyone	1
But	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
Why	1
you	1
ve	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
crying	1
wrathfully	1
I	1
know	1
if	1
one	1
were	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
you	1
interrupted	1
the	1
princess	1
we	1
should	1
never	1
marry	1
our	1
daughter	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
we	1
d	1
better	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
Well	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
But	1
do	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
Do	1
I	1
try	1
and	1
catch	1
them	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
try	1
to	1
catch	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
A	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
one	1
has	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
I	1
fancy	1
Oh	1
yes	1
you	1
fancy	1
And	1
how	1
if	1
she	1
really	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
no	1
more	1
thinking	1
of	1
marriage	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
Ah	1
spiritualism	1
Ah	1
Nice	1
Ah	1
the	1
ball	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
imagining	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mimicking	1
his	1
wife	1
made	1
a	1
mincing	1
curtsey	1
at	1
each	1
word	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
how	1
we	1
re	1
preparing	1
wretchedness	1
for	1
Kitty	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
really	1
got	1
the	1
notion	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
But	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
suppose	1
so	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
suppose	1
I	1
know	1
We	1
have	1
eyes	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
though	1
women	1
folk	1
haven	1
t	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
serious	1
intentions	1
that	1
s	1
Levin	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
peacock	1
like	1
this	1
feather	1
head	1
who	1
s	1
only	1
amusing	1
himself	1
Oh	1
well	1
when	1
once	1
you	1
get	1

Well	1
you	1
ll	1
remember	1
my	1
words	1
but	1
too	1
late	1
just	1
as	1
with	1
Dolly	1
Well	1
well	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
princess	1
stopped	1
him	1
recollecting	1
her	1
unlucky	1
Dolly	1
By	1
all	1
means	1
and	1
good	1
night	1
And	1
signing	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
parted	1
with	1
a	1
kiss	1
feeling	1
that	1
they	1
each	1
remained	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
opinion	1
The	1
princess	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
that	1
evening	1
had	1
settled	1
Kitty	1
s	1
future	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
intentions	1
but	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
words	1
had	1
disturbed	1
her	1
And	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
in	1
terror	1
before	1
the	1
unknown	1
future	1
she	1
too	1
like	1
Kitty	1
repeated	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1

Vronsky	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
real	1
home	1
life	1
His	1
mother	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
youth	1
a	1
brilliant	1
society	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
during	1
her	1
married	1
life	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
afterwards	1
many	1
love	1
affairs	1
notorious	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
fashionable	1
world	1
His	1
father	1
he	1
scarcely	1
remembered	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
the	1
Corps	1
of	1
Pages	1
Leaving	1
the	1
school	1
very	1
young	1
as	1
a	1
brilliant	1
officer	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
wealthy	1
Petersburg	1
army	1
men	1
Although	1
he	1
did	1
go	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
into	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
his	1
love	1
affairs	1
had	1
always	1
hitherto	1
been	1
outside	1
it	1
In	1
Moscow	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
felt	1
after	1
his	1
luxurious	1
and	1
coarse	1
life	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
intimacy	1
with	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
innocent	1
girl	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
rank	1
who	1
cared	1
for	1
him	1
It	1
never	1
even	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
any	1
harm	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Kitty	1
At	1
balls	1
he	1
danced	1
principally	1
with	1
her	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
visitor	1
at	1
their	1
house	1
He	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
people	1
commonly	1
do	1
talk	1
in	1
society	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
nonsense	1
but	1
nonsense	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
attaching	1
a	1
special	1
meaning	1
in	1
her	1
case	1
Although	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
before	1
everybody	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
dependent	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
the	1
better	1
he	1
liked	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
tenderer	1
was	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
mode	1
of	1
behavior	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
Kitty	1
had	1
a	1
definite	1
character	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
courting	1
young	1
girls	1
with	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
marriage	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
courting	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
actions	1
common	1
among	1
brilliant	1
young	1
men	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
had	1
discovered	1
this	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
enjoying	1
his	1
discovery	1
If	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
her	1
parents	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
evening	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
put	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
Kitty	1
would	1
be	1
unhappy	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
marry	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
what	1
gave	1
such	1
great	1
and	1
delicate	1
pleasure	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
her	1
could	1
be	1
wrong	1
Still	1
less	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
marry	1
Marriage	1
had	1
never	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
possibility	1
He	1
not	1
only	1
disliked	1
family	1
life	1
but	1
a	1
family	1
and	1
especially	1
a	1
husband	1
was	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
views	1
general	1
in	1
the	1
bachelor	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived	1
conceived	1
as	1
something	1
alien	1
repellant	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
ridiculous	1
But	1
though	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
suspicion	1
what	1
the	1
parents	1
were	1
saying	1
he	1
felt	1
on	1
coming	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
that	1
the	1
secret	1
spiritual	1
bond	1
which	1
existed	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Kitty	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
much	1
stronger	1
that	1
evening	1
that	1
some	1
step	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
But	1
what	1
step	1
could	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
What	1
is	1
so	1
exquisite	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
carrying	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
a	1
delicious	1
feeling	1
of	1
purity	1
and	1
freshness	1
arising	1
partly	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
smoking	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
evening	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
a	1
new	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
at	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
what	1
is	1
so	1
exquisite	1
is	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
by	1
me	1
or	1
by	1
her	1
but	1
we	1
understand	1
each	1
other	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
this	1
unseen	1
language	1
of	1
looks	1
and	1
tones	1
that	1
this	1
evening	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
ever	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
she	1
loves	1
me	1
And	1
how	1
secretly	1
simply	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
how	1
trustfully	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
better	1
purer	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good	1
in	1
me	1
Those	1
sweet	1
loving	1
eyes	1
When	1
she	1
said	1
Indeed	1
I	1
do	1
Well	1
what	1
then	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
It	1
s	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
her	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
wondering	1
where	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
evening	1
He	1
passed	1
in	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
places	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
Club	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
bezique	1
champagne	1
with	1
Ignatov	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
Ch^ateau	1
des	1
Fleurs	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
Oblonsky	1
songs	1
the	1
cancan	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
sick	1
of	1
it	1
That	1
s	1
why	1
I	1
like	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
growing	1
better	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
home	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
at	1
Dussots	1
Hotel	1
ordered	1
supper	1
and	1
then	1
undressed	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
head	1
touched	1
the	1
pillow	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
sound	1
sleep	1

Next	1
day	1
at	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Vronsky	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
railway	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
flight	1
of	1
steps	1
was	1
Oblonsky	1
who	1
was	1
expecting	1
his	1
sister	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
train	1
Ah	1
your	1
excellency	1
cried	1
Oblonsky	1
whom	1
are	1
you	1
meeting	1
My	1
mother	1
Vronsky	1
responded	1
smiling	1
as	1
everyone	1
did	1
who	1
met	1
Oblonsky	1
He	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
together	1
they	1
ascended	1
the	1
steps	1
She	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
today	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
till	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
last	1
night	1
Where	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
after	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
Home	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
I	1
felt	1
so	1
well	1
content	1
yesterday	1
after	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
that	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
gallant	1
steed	1
by	1
tokens	1
sure	1
And	1
by	1
his	1
eyes	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
youth	1
in	1
love	1
declaimed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before	1
to	1
Levin	1
Vronsky	1
smiled	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
deny	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
promptly	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
And	1
whom	1
are	1
you	1
meeting	1
he	1
asked	1
I	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
Honi	1
soit	1

pense	1
	1
My	1
sister	1
Anna	1
Ah	1
that	1
s	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
You	1
know	1
her	1
no	1
doubt	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
do	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
not	1
I	1
really	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
Vronsky	1
answered	1
heedlessly	1
with	1
a	1
vague	1
recollection	1
of	1
something	1
stiff	1
and	1
tedious	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
Karenina	1
But	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
my	1
celebrated	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
you	1
surely	1
must	1
know	1
All	1
the	1
world	1
knows	1
him	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
by	1
reputation	1
and	1
by	1
sight	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
clever	1
learned	1
religious	1
somewhat	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
line	1
	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
English	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
man	1
rather	1
a	1
conservative	1
but	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
observed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
Oh	1
well	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
Oh	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
a	1
tall	1
old	1
footman	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
come	1
here	1
Besides	1
the	1
charm	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
in	1
general	1
for	1
everyone	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
felt	1
of	1
late	1
specially	1
drawn	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
he	1
was	1
associated	1
with	1
Kitty	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
Shall	1
we	1
give	1
a	1
supper	1
on	1
Sunday	1
for	1
the	1
diva	1
	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
taking	1
his	1
arm	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
m	1
collecting	1
subscriptions	1
Oh	1
did	1
you	1
make	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
Levin	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Yes	1
but	1
he	1
left	1
rather	1
early	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
pursued	1
Oblonsky	1
Isn	1
t	1
he	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
responded	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
all	1
Moscow	1
people	1
present	1
company	1
of	1
course	1
excepted	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
jestingly	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
uncompromising	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
defensive	1
lose	1
their	1
tempers	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
all	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
feel	1
something	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
good	1
humoredly	1
Will	1
the	1
train	1
soon	1
be	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
asked	1
a	1
railway	1
official	1
The	1
train	1
s	1
signaled	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
The	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
evident	1
by	1
the	1
preparatory	1
bustle	1
in	1
the	1
station	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
porters	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
policemen	1
and	1
attendants	1
and	1
people	1
meeting	1
the	1
train	1
Through	1
the	1
frosty	1
vapor	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
workmen	1
in	1
short	1
sheepskins	1
and	1
soft	1
felt	1
boots	1
crossing	1
the	1
rails	1
of	1
the	1
curving	1
line	1
The	1
hiss	1
of	1
the	1
boiler	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
distant	1
rails	1
and	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
something	1
heavy	1
No	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
felt	1
a	1
great	1
inclination	1
to	1
tell	1
Vronsky	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
intentions	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
Kitty	1
No	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
got	1
a	1
true	1
impression	1
of	1
Levin	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nervous	1
man	1
and	1
is	1
sometimes	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
often	1
very	1
nice	1
He	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
true	1
honest	1
nature	1
and	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
gold	1
But	1
yesterday	1
there	1
were	1
special	1
reasons	1
pursued	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
meaning	1
smile	1
totally	1
oblivious	1
of	1
the	1
genuine	1
sympathy	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
for	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
same	1
sympathy	1
now	1
only	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
Yes	1
there	1
were	1
reasons	1
why	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
either	1
particularly	1
happy	1
or	1
particularly	1
unhappy	1
Vronsky	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
asked	1
directly	1
How	1
so	1
Do	1
you	1
mean	1
he	1
made	1
your	1
belle	1
soeur	1
an	1
offer	1

fancied	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
yesterday	1
Yes	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
early	1
and	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
too	1
it	1
must	1
mean	1
it	1
He	1
s	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
So	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
imagine	1
though	1
she	1
might	1
reckon	1
on	1
a	1
better	1
match	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
about	1
again	1
though	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
him	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
added	1
Yes	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
hateful	1
position	1
That	1
s	1
why	1
most	1
fellows	1
prefer	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Klaras	1
If	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
succeed	1
with	1
them	1
it	1
only	1
proves	1
that	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
enough	1
cash	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
one	1
s	1
dignity	1
s	1
at	1
stake	1
But	1
here	1
s	1
the	1
train	1
The	1
engine	1
had	1
already	1
whistled	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
A	1
few	1
instants	1
later	1
the	1
platform	1
was	1
quivering	1
and	1
with	1
puffs	1
of	1
steam	1
hanging	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
from	1
the	1
frost	1
the	1
engine	1
rolled	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
lever	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
wheel	1
rhythmically	1
moving	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
stooping	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
engine	1
driver	1
covered	1
with	1
frost	1
Behind	1
the	1
tender	1
setting	1
the	1
platform	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
slowly	1
swaying	1
came	1
the	1
luggage	1
van	1
with	1
a	1
dog	1
whining	1
in	1
it	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
passenger	1
carriages	1
rolled	1
in	1
oscillating	1
before	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
A	1
smart	1
guard	1
jumped	1
out	1
giving	1
a	1
whistle	1
and	1
after	1
him	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
impatient	1
passengers	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
down	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
holding	1
himself	1
erect	1
and	1
looking	1
severely	1
about	1
him	1
a	1
nimble	1
little	1
merchant	1
with	1
a	1
satchel	1
smiling	1
gaily	1
a	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
sack	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
Vronsky	1
standing	1
beside	1
Oblonsky	1
watched	1
the	1
carriages	1
and	1
the	1
passengers	1
totally	1
oblivious	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
What	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
heard	1
about	1
Kitty	1
excited	1
and	1
delighted	1
him	1
Unconsciously	1
he	1
arched	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
flashed	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
conqueror	1
Countess	1
Vronskaya	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
compartment	1
said	1
the	1
smart	1
guard	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
The	1
guard	1
s	1
words	1
roused	1
him	1
and	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
approaching	1
meeting	1
with	1
her	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
respect	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
without	1
acknowledging	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
though	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
set	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
education	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
conceived	1
of	1
any	1
behavior	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
respectful	1
and	1
obedient	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
externally	1
obedient	1
and	1
respectful	1

behavior	1

Chapter	1
18	1
Vronsky	1
followed	1
the	1
guard	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
compartment	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
was	1
getting	1
out	1
With	1
the	1
insight	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
one	1
glance	1
at	1
this	1
lady	1
s	1
appearance	1
Vronsky	1
classified	1
her	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society	1
He	1
begged	1
pardon	1
and	1
was	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
but	1
felt	1
he	1
must	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
once	1
more	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
beautiful	1
not	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
elegance	1
and	1
modest	1
grace	1
which	1
were	1
apparent	1
in	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
but	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
close	1
by	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
peculiarly	1
caressing	1
and	1
soft	1
As	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
she	1
too	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
Her	1
shining	1
gray	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
dark	1
from	1
the	1
thick	1
lashes	1
rested	1
with	1
friendly	1
attention	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
recognizing	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
promptly	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
passing	1
crowd	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
someone	1
In	1
that	1
brief	1
look	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
suppressed	1
eagerness	1
which	1
played	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
flitted	1
between	1
the	1
brilliant	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
faint	1
smile	1
that	1
curved	1
her	1
red	1
lips	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
nature	1
were	1
so	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
something	1
that	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
it	1
showed	1
itself	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
flash	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
now	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
Deliberately	1
she	1
shrouded	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
it	1
shone	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
faintly	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
Vronsky	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
His	1
mother	1
a	1
dried	1
up	1
old	1
lady	1
with	1
black	1
eyes	1
and	1
ringlets	1
screwed	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
scanning	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
smiled	1
slightly	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
lips	1
Getting	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
handing	1
her	1
maid	1
a	1
bag	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
little	1
wrinkled	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
her	1
hand	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
cheek	1
You	1
got	1
my	1
telegram	1
Quite	1
well	1
Thank	1
God	1
You	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
journey	1
said	1
her	1
son	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
listening	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
voice	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
He	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
All	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
s	1
voice	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
view	1
madame	1
Not	1
Petersburg	1
but	1
simply	1
feminine	1
she	1
responded	1
Well	1
well	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
kiss	1
your	1
hand	1
Good	1
bye	1
Ivan	1
Petrovitch	1
And	1
could	1
you	1
see	1
if	1
my	1
brother	1
is	1
here	1
and	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
stepped	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
compartment	1
Well	1
have	1
you	1
found	1
your	1
brother	1
said	1
Countess	1
Vronskaya	1
addressing	1
the	1
lady	1
Vronsky	1
understood	1
now	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
Your	1
brother	1
is	1
here	1
he	1
said	1
standing	1
up	1
Excuse	1
me	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
indeed	1
our	1
acquaintance	1
was	1
so	1
slight	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
bowing	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
me	1
Oh	1
no	1
said	1
she	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
because	1
your	1
mother	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
talking	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
As	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
let	1
the	1
eagerness	1
that	1
would	1
insist	1
on	1
coming	1
out	1
show	1
itself	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
And	1
still	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
Do	1
call	1
him	1
Alexey	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
Vronsky	1
stepped	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
shouted	1
Oblonsky	1
Here	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
however	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
stepped	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
light	1
resolute	1
step	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
her	1
brother	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
that	1
struck	1
Vronsky	1
by	1
its	1
decision	1
and	1
its	1
grace	1
she	1
flung	1
her	1
left	1
arm	1
around	1
his	1
neck	1
drew	1
him	1
rapidly	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
warmly	1
Vronsky	1
gazed	1
never	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
smiled	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
why	1
But	1
recollecting	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
She	1
s	1
very	1
sweet	1
isn	1
t	1
she	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
of	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
Her	1
husband	1
put	1
her	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
We	1
ve	1
been	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
I	1
hear	1
vous	1
filez	1
le	1
parfait	1
amour	1
Tant	1
mieux	1
mon	1
cher	1
tant	1
mieux	1
	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
referring	1
to	1
maman	1
he	1
answered	1
coldly	1
Come	1
maman	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
entered	1
the	1
carriage	1
again	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
Well	1
countess	1
you	1
have	1
met	1
your	1
son	1
and	1
I	1
my	1
brother	1
she	1
said	1
And	1
all	1
my	1
gossip	1
is	1
exhausted	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
Oh	1
no	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
I	1
could	1
go	1
all	1
around	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
never	1
be	1
dull	1
You	1
are	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
delightful	1
women	1
in	1
whose	1
company	1
it	1
s	1
sweet	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
talk	1
Now	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
fret	1
over	1
your	1
son	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
expect	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
holding	1
herself	1
very	1
erect	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
smiling	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
the	1
countess	1
said	1
in	1
explanation	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
has	1
a	1
little	1
son	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
I	1
believe	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
before	1
and	1
she	1
keeps	1
fretting	1
over	1
leaving	1
him	1
Yes	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
she	1
of	1
hers	1
said	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
smile	1
lighted	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
a	1
caressing	1
smile	1
intended	1
for	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
dreadfully	1
bored	1
he	1
said	1
promptly	1
catching	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
coquetry	1
she	1
had	1
flung	1
him	1
But	1
apparently	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
that	1
strain	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
Thank	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
The	1
time	1
has	1
passed	1
so	1
quickly	1
Good	1
bye	1
countess	1
Good	1
bye	1
my	1
love	1
answered	1
the	1
countess	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
your	1
pretty	1
face	1
I	1
speak	1
plainly	1
at	1
my	1
age	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
simply	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
lost	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
you	1
Stereotyped	1
as	1
the	1
phrase	1
was	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
obviously	1
believed	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
by	1
it	1
She	1
flushed	1
bent	1
down	1
slightly	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
cheek	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
s	1
lips	1
drew	1
herself	1
up	1
again	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
fluttering	1
between	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
pressed	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
as	1
though	1
at	1
something	1
special	1
by	1
the	1
energetic	1
squeeze	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
freely	1
and	1
vigorously	1
shook	1
his	1
hand	1
She	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
rapid	1
step	1
which	1
bore	1
her	1
rather	1
fully	1
developed	1
figure	1
with	1
such	1
strange	1
lightness	1
Very	1
charming	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
That	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
her	1
son	1
was	1
thinking	1
His	1
eyes	1
followed	1
her	1
till	1
her	1
graceful	1
figure	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
smile	1
remained	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
He	1
saw	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
how	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
put	1
her	1
arm	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
something	1
eagerly	1
obviously	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
annoyed	1
Well	1
maman	1
are	1
you	1
perfectly	1
well	1
he	1
repeated	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
Everything	1
has	1
been	1
delightful	1
Alexander	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
Marie	1
has	1
grown	1
very	1
pretty	1
She	1
s	1
very	1
interesting	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
again	1
of	1
what	1
interested	1
her	1
most	1
the	1
christening	1
of	1
her	1
grandson	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
the	1
special	1
favor	1

looking	1
out	1

the	1
window	1
now	1

if	1

The	1
old	1
butler	1
who	1
had	1
traveled	1
with	1
the	1
countess	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
ready	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
Come	1

Vronsky	1
The	1

the	1
butler	1
and	1
a	1
porter	1
the	1

Vronsky	1
gave	1
his	1
mother	1
his	1
arm	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
several	1
men	1
ran	1
suddenly	1
by	1
with	1
panic	1
stricken	1
faces	1
The	1
station	1
master	1
too	1
ran	1
by	1
in	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
colored	1
cap	1
Obviously	1
something	1
unusual	1
had	1
happened	1
The	1
crowd	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
train	1
were	1
running	1
back	1
again	1

the	1
crowd	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
turned	1
back	1
They	1
too	1
looked	1
scared	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
carriage	1
door	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
crowd	1
The	1
ladies	1
got	1
in	1
while	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
followed	1
the	1
crowd	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
disaster	1
A	1
guard	1
either	1
drunk	1
or	1
too	1
much	1
muffled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
bitter	1
frost	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
train	1
moving	1
back	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
crushed	1
Before	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Oblonsky	1
came	1
back	1
the	1
ladies	1
heard	1
the	1
facts	1
from	1
the	1
butler	1
Oblonsky	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
both	1
seen	1
the	1
mutilated	1
corpse	1
Oblonsky	1
was	1
evidently	1
upset	1
He	1
frowned	1
and	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
Ah	1
how	1
awful	1
Ah	1
Anna	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
Ah	1
how	1
awful	1
he	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
was	1
serious	1
but	1
perfectly	1
composed	1
Oh	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
countess	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
And	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
there	1
It	1
was	1
awful	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
She	1
flung	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
support	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
family	1
How	1
awful	1
Couldn	1
t	1
one	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
her	1
said	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
in	1
an	1
agitated	1
whisper	1
Vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
immediately	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
back	1
directly	1
maman	1
he	1
remarked	1
turning	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
countess	1
about	1
the	1
new	1
singer	1
while	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
impatiently	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
Now	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
off	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
coming	1
in	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
together	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
Behind	1
walked	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
Just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
station	1
the	1
station	1
master	1
overtook	1
Vronsky	1
You	1
gave	1
my	1
assistant	1
two	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
Would	1
you	1
kindly	1
explain	1
for	1
whose	1
benefit	1
you	1
intend	1
them	1
For	1
the	1
widow	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
You	1
gave	1
that	1
cried	1
Oblonsky	1
behind	1
and	1
pressing	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
hand	1
he	1
added	1
Very	1
nice	1
very	1
nice	1
Isn	1
t	1
he	1
a	1
splendid	1
fellow	1
Good	1
bye	1
countess	1
And	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
stood	1
still	1
looking	1
for	1
her	1
maid	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
carriage	1
had	1
already	1
driven	1
away	1
People	1
coming	1
in	1
were	1
still	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1
What	1
a	1
horrible	1
death	1
said	1
a	1
gentleman	1
passing	1
by	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
cut	1
in	1
two	1
pieces	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
easiest	1
instantaneous	1
observed	1
another	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
take	1
proper	1
precautions	1
said	1
a	1
third	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
seated	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
with	1
surprise	1
that	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
restraining	1
her	1
tears	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
Anna	1
he	1
asked	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
yards	1
It	1
s	1
an	1
omen	1
of	1
evil	1
she	1
said	1
What	1
nonsense	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
You	1
ve	1
come	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
conceive	1
how	1
I	1
m	1
resting	1
my	1
hopes	1
on	1
you	1
Have	1
you	1
known	1
Vronsky	1
long	1
she	1
asked	1
Yes	1
You	1
know	1
we	1
re	1
hoping	1
he	1
will	1
marry	1
Kitty	1
Yes	1
said	1
Anna	1
softly	1
Come	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
tossing	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
physically	1
shake	1
off	1
something	1
superfluous	1
oppressing	1
her	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
your	1
affairs	1
I	1
got	1
your	1
letter	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
Yes	1
all	1
my	1
hopes	1
are	1
in	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Well	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story	1
On	1
reaching	1
home	1
Oblonsky	1
helped	1
his	1
sister	1
out	1
sighed	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
office	1
Chapter	1
19	1
When	1
Anna	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Dolly	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
headed	1
fat	1
little	1
boy	1
already	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
lesson	1
in	1
French	1
reading	1
As	1
the	1
boy	1
read	1
he	1
kept	1
twisting	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
tear	1
off	1
a	1
button	1
that	1
was	1
nearly	1
off	1
his	1
jacket	1
His	1
mother	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
taken	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
fat	1
little	1
hand	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
button	1
again	1
His	1
mother	1
pulled	1
the	1
button	1
off	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
pocket	1
Keep	1
your	1
hands	1
still	1
Grisha	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
work	1
a	1
coverlet	1
she	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
making	1
She	1
always	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
it	1
at	1
depressed	1
moments	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
knitted	1
at	1
it	1
nervously	1
twitching	1
her	1
fingers	1
and	1
counting	1
the	1
stitches	1
Though	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
word	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
whether	1
his	1
sister	1
came	1
or	1
not	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
everything	1
ready	1
for	1
her	1
arrival	1
and	1
was	1
expecting	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
emotion	1
Dolly	1
was	1
crushed	1
by	1
her	1
sorrow	1
utterly	1
swallowed	1
up	1
by	1
it	1
Still	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
Anna	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
personages	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
Petersburg	1
grande	1
dame	1
And	1
thanks	1
to	1
this	1
circumstance	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
out	1
her	1
threat	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
coming	1
And	1
after	1
all	1
Anna	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
to	1
blame	1
thought	1
Dolly	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
except	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing	1
but	1
kindness	1
and	1
affection	1
from	1
her	1
towards	1
myself	1
It	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
recall	1
her	1
impressions	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
the	1
Karenins	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
their	1
household	1
itself	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
artificial	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
framework	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
life	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
not	1
receive	1
her	1
If	1
only	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
console	1
me	1
thought	1
Dolly	1
All	1
consolation	1
and	1
counsel	1
and	1
Christian	1
forgiveness	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
over	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
no	1
use	1
All	1
these	1
days	1
Dolly	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
her	1
sorrow	1
but	1
with	1
that	1
sorrow	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
outside	1
matters	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
Anna	1
everything	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
alternately	1
glad	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
speaking	1
freely	1
and	1
angry	1
at	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
speaking	1
of	1
her	1
humiliation	1
with	1
her	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
of	1
hearing	1
her	1
ready	1
made	1
phrases	1
of	1
good	1
advice	1
and	1
comfort	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
her	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
every	1
minute	1
and	1
as	1
so	1
often	1
happens	1
let	1
slip	1
just	1
that	1
minute	1
when	1
her	1
visitor	1
arrived	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
bell	1
Catching	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
skirts	1
and	1
light	1
steps	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
she	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
her	1
care	1
worn	1
face	1
unconsciously	1
expressed	1
not	1
gladness	1
but	1
wonder	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
What	1
here	1
already	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
Dolly	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
too	1
said	1
Dolly	1
faintly	1
smiling	1
and	1
trying	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
she	1
knew	1
Most	1
likely	1
she	1
knows	1
she	1
thought	1
noticing	1
the	1
sympathy	1
in	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
Well	1
come	1
along	1
I	1
ll	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
room	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
trying	1
to	1
defer	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
confidences	1
Is	1
this	1
Grisha	1
Heavens	1
how	1
he	1
s	1
grown	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
kissing	1
him	1
never	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
Dolly	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
flushed	1
a	1
little	1
No	1
please	1
let	1
us	1
stay	1
here	1
She	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
kerchief	1
and	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
catching	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
curls	1
she	1
tossed	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
hair	1
down	1
You	1
are	1
radiant	1
with	1
health	1
and	1
happiness	1
said	1
Dolly	1
almost	1
with	1
envy	1
I	1
Yes	1
said	1
Anna	1
Merciful	1
heavens	1
Tanya	1
You	1
re	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
as	1
my	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
added	1
addressing	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
in	1
She	1
took	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
Delightful	1
child	1
delightful	1
Show	1
me	1
them	1
all	1
She	1
mentioned	1
them	1
not	1
only	1
remembering	1
the	1
names	1
but	1
the	1
years	1
months	1
characters	1
illnesses	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
Dolly	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
appreciate	1
that	1
Very	1
well	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
them	1
she	1
said	1
It	1
s	1

pity	1
Vassya	1
s	1
asleep	1
After	1
seeing	1
the	1
children	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
alone	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
coffee	1
Anna	1
took	1
the	1
tray	1
and	1
then	1
pushed	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
Dolly	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
Dolly	1
looked	1
coldly	1
at	1
Anna	1
she	1
was	1
waiting	1
now	1
for	1
phrases	1
of	1
conventional	1
sympathy	1
but	1
Anna	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
Dolly	1
dear	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
nor	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
comfort	1
you	1
that	1
s	1
impossible	1
But	1
darling	1
I	1
m	1
simply	1
sorry	1
sorry	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
for	1
you	1
Under	1
the	1
thick	1
lashes	1
of	1
her	1
shining	1
eyes	1
tears	1
suddenly	1
glittered	1
She	1
moved	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
vigorous	1
little	1
hand	1
Dolly	1
did	1
not	1
shrink	1
away	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
its	1
frigid	1
expression	1
She	1
said	1
To	1
comfort	1
me	1

And	1
directly	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
softened	1
Anna	1
lifted	1
the	1
wasted	1
thin	1
hand	1
of	1
Dolly	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
said	1
But	1
Dolly	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
act	1
in	1
this	1
awful	1
position	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
you	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
All	1
s	1
over	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
more	1
said	1
Dolly	1
And	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
cast	1
him	1
off	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
I	1
am	1
tied	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
torture	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
Dolly	1
darling	1
he	1
has	1
spoken	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
from	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
Dolly	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
inquiringly	1
Sympathy	1
and	1
love	1
unfeigned	1
were	1
visible	1
on	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
Very	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
was	1
married	1
With	1
the	1
education	1
mamma	1
gave	1
us	1
I	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
innocent	1
I	1
was	1
stupid	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
say	1
men	1
tell	1
their	1
wives	1
of	1
their	1
former	1
lives	1
but	1
Stiva	1
she	1
corrected	1
herself	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
told	1
me	1
nothing	1
You	1
ll	1
hardly	1
believe	1
it	1
but	1
till	1
now	1
I	1
imagined	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
So	1
I	1
lived	1
eight	1
years	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
suspecting	1
infidelity	1
I	1
regarded	1
it	1
as	1
impossible	1
and	1
then	1
try	1
to	1
imagine	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
ideas	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
suddenly	1
all	1
the	1
horror	1
all	1
the	1
loathsomeness	1
You	1
must	1
try	1
and	1
understand	1
me	1
To	1
be	1
fully	1
convinced	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
continued	1
Dolly	1
holding	1
back	1
her	1
sobs	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
letter	1
his	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
mistress	1
my	1
governess	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
awful	1
She	1
hastily	1
pulled	1
out	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
being	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
feeling	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
silence	1
but	1
deliberately	1
slyly	1
deceiving	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
To	1
go	1
on	1
being	1
my	1
husband	1
together	1
with	1
her	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
Oh	1
yes	1
I	1
understand	1
I	1
understand	1
Dolly	1
dearest	1
I	1
do	1
understand	1
said	1
Anna	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
he	1
realizes	1
all	1
the	1
awfulness	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
Dolly	1
resumed	1
Not	1
the	1
slightest	1
He	1
s	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
Oh	1
no	1
Anna	1
interposed	1
quickly	1
He	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
he	1
s	1
weighed	1
down	1
by	1
remorse	1
Is	1
he	1
capable	1
of	1
remorse	1
Dolly	1
interrupted	1
gazing	1
intently	1
into	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
s	1
face	1
Yes	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
feeling	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
We	1
both	1
know	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
good	1
hearted	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
proud	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
humiliated	1
What	1
touched	1
me	1
most	1
and	1
here	1
Anna	1
guessed	1
what	1
would	1
touch	1
Dolly	1
most	1
he	1
s	1
tortured	1
by	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
ashamed	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
sake	1
and	1
that	1
loving	1
you	1
yes	1
yes	1
loving	1
you	1
beyond	1
everything	1
on	1
earth	1
she	1
hurriedly	1
interrupted	1
Dolly	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
he	1
has	1
hurt	1
you	1
pierced	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
No	1
no	1
she	1
cannot	1
forgive	1
me	1
he	1
keeps	1
saying	1
Dolly	1
looked	1
dreamily	1
away	1
beyond	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
as	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
words	1
Yes	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
position	1
is	1
awful	1
it	1
s	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
guilty	1
than	1
the	1
innocent	1
she	1
said	1
if	1
he	1
feels	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
comes	1
from	1
his	1
fault	1
But	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
again	1
after	1
her	1
For	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
torture	1
just	1
because	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
past	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
And	1
sobs	1
cut	1
short	1
her	1
words	1
But	1
as	1
though	1
of	1
set	1
design	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
softened	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
again	1
of	1
what	1
exasperated	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
young	1
you	1
see	1
she	1
s	1
pretty	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Anna	1
my	1
youth	1
and	1
my	1
beauty	1
are	1
gone	1
taken	1
by	1
whom	1
By	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
I	1
have	1
worked	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
I	1
had	1
has	1
gone	1
in	1
his	1
service	1
and	1
now	1
of	1
course	1
any	1
fresh	1
vulgar	1
creature	1
has	1
more	1
charm	1
for	1
him	1
No	1
doubt	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
me	1
together	1
or	1
worse	1
still	1
they	1
were	1
silent	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
Again	1
her	1
eyes	1
glowed	1
with	1
hatred	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
believe	1
him	1
Never	1
No	1
everything	1
is	1
over	1
everything	1
that	1
once	1
made	1
my	1
comfort	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
my	1
work	1
and	1
my	1
sufferings	1
Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it	1
I	1
was	1
teaching	1
Grisha	1
just	1
now	1
once	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
joy	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
torture	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
strive	1
and	1
toil	1
for	1
Why	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
here	1
What	1
s	1
so	1
awful	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
my	1
heart	1
s	1
turned	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
tenderness	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
hatred	1
for	1
him	1
yes	1
hatred	1
I	1
could	1
kill	1
him	1
Darling	1
Dolly	1
I	1
understand	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
torture	1
yourself	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
distressed	1
so	1
overwrought	1
that	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
many	1
things	1
mistakenly	1
Dolly	1
grew	1
calmer	1
and	1
for	1
two	1
minutes	1
both	1
were	1
silent	1
What	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
Think	1
for	1
me	1
Anna	1
help	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
over	1
everything	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
nothing	1
Anna	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
heart	1
responded	1
instantly	1
to	1
each	1
word	1
to	1
each	1
change	1
of	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
One	1
thing	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
began	1
Anna	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
sister	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
character	1
that	1
faculty	1
of	1
forgetting	1
everything	1
everything	1
she	1
waved	1
her	1
hand	1
before	1
her	1
forehead	1
that	1
faculty	1
for	1
being	1
completely	1
carried	1
away	1
but	1
for	1
completely	1
repenting	1
too	1
He	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
he	1
cannot	1
comprehend	1
now	1
how	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
acted	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
No	1
he	1
understands	1
he	1
understood	1
Dolly	1
broke	1
in	1
But	1
I	1
you	1
are	1
forgetting	1
me	1
does	1
it	1
make	1
it	1
easier	1
for	1
me	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
When	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
own	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
all	1
the	1
awfulness	1
of	1
your	1
position	1
I	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
was	1
broken	1
up	1
I	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
after	1
talking	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
quite	1
differently	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
agony	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
sorry	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
you	1
But	1
Dolly	1
darling	1
I	1
fully	1
realize	1
your	1
sufferings	1
only	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
love	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
for	1
him	1
That	1
you	1
know	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
forgive	1
him	1
No	1
Dolly	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
Anna	1
cut	1
her	1
short	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
you	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
men	1
like	1
Stiva	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
You	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
talking	1
of	1
you	1
with	1
her	1
That	1
never	1
happened	1
Such	1
men	1
are	1
unfaithful	1
but	1
their	1
home	1
and	1
wife	1
are	1
sacred	1
to	1
them	1
Somehow	1
or	1
other	1
these	1
women	1
are	1
still	1
looked	1
on	1
with	1
contempt	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
touch	1
on	1
their	1
feeling	1
for	1
their	1
family	1
They	1
draw	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
line	1
that	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
crossed	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
Yes	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
kissed	1
her	1
Dolly	1
hush	1
darling	1
I	1
saw	1
Stiva	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
cried	1
talking	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
poetry	1
and	1
loftiness	1
of	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
longer	1
he	1
has	1
lived	1
with	1
you	1
the	1
loftier	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
You	1
know	1
we	1
have	1
sometimes	1
laughed	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
putting	1
in	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
Dolly	1
s	1
a	1
marvelous	1
woman	1
You	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
divinity	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
that	1
still	1
and	1
this	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
an	1
infidelity	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
repeated	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
Yes	1
but	1
could	1
you	1
forgive	1
it	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
judge	1
Yes	1
I	1
can	1
said	1
Anna	1
thinking	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
grasping	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
her	1
thought	1
and	1
weighing	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
inner	1
balance	1
she	1
added	1
Yes	1
I	1
can	1
I	1
can	1
I	1
can	1
Yes	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
it	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
no	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
it	1
and	1
forgive	1
it	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
never	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
Oh	1
of	1
course	1
Dolly	1
interposed	1
quickly	1
as	1
though	1
saying	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
thought	1
else	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
forgiveness	1
If	1
one	1
forgives	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
completely	1
completely	1
Come	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
I	1
ll	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
she	1
embraced	1
Anna	1
My	1
dear	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
came	1
It	1
has	1
made	1
things	1
better	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
Chapter	1
20	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
Anna	1
spent	1
at	1
home	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
and	1
received	1
no	1
one	1
though	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
arrival	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
Anna	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
with	1
Dolly	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
She	1
merely	1
sent	1
a	1
brief	1
note	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
home	1
Come	1
God	1
is	1
merciful	1
she	1
wrote	1
Oblonsky	1
did	1
dine	1
at	1
home	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
general	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
addressed	1
him	1
as	1
Stiva	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
before	1
In	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
the	1
same	1
estrangement	1
still	1
remained	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
talk	1
now	1
of	1
separation	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
explanation	1
and	1
reconciliation	1
Immediately	1
after	1
dinner	1
Kitty	1
came	1
in	1
She	1
knew	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
but	1
only	1
very	1
slightly	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
now	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
with	1
some	1
trepidation	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
meeting	1
this	1
fashionable	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
whom	1
everyone	1
spoke	1
so	1
highly	1
of	1
But	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
favorable	1
impression	1
on	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
at	1
once	1
Anna	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
admiring	1
her	1
loveliness	1
and	1
her	1
youth	1
before	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
not	1
merely	1
under	1
Anna	1
s	1
sway	1
but	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
young	1
girls	1
do	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
older	1
and	1
married	1
women	1
Anna	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
fashionable	1
lady	1
nor	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
In	1
the	1
elasticity	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
the	1
freshness	1
and	1
the	1
unflagging	1
eagerness	1
which	1
persisted	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
broke	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
glance	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
passed	1
for	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
twenty	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
mournful	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
struck	1
and	1
attracted	1
Kitty	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
perfectly	1
simple	1
and	1
was	1
concealing	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
another	1
higher	1
world	1
of	1
interests	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
her	1
complex	1
and	1
poetic	1
After	1
dinner	1
when	1
Dolly	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
Anna	1
rose	1
quickly	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
just	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigar	1
Stiva	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
winking	1
gaily	1
crossing	1
him	1
and	1
glancing	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
go	1
and	1
God	1
help	1
you	1
He	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
cigar	1
understanding	1
her	1
and	1
departed	1
through	1
the	1
doorway	1
When	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
disappeared	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
children	1
Either	1
because	1
the	1
children	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
aunt	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
felt	1
a	1
special	1
charm	1
in	1
her	1
themselves	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
ones	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
following	1
their	1
lead	1
as	1
children	1
so	1
often	1
do	1
had	1
clung	1
about	1
their	1
new	1
aunt	1
since	1
before	1
dinner	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
side	1
And	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
game	1
among	1
them	1
to	1
sit	1
a	1
close	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
their	1
aunt	1
to	1
touch	1
her	1
hold	1
her	1
little	1
hand	1
kiss	1
it	1
play	1
with	1
her	1
ring	1
or	1
even	1
touch	1
the	1
flounce	1
of	1
her	1
skirt	1
Come	1
come	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
sitting	1
before	1
said	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
And	1
again	1
Grisha	1
poked	1
his	1
little	1
face	1
under	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
nestled	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
her	1
gown	1
beaming	1
with	1
pride	1
and	1
happiness	1
And	1
when	1
is	1
your	1
next	1
ball	1
she	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
Next	1
week	1
and	1
a	1
splendid	1
ball	1
One	1
of	1
those	1
balls	1
where	1
one	1
always	1
enjoys	1
oneself	1
Why	1
are	1
there	1
balls	1
where	1
one	1
always	1
enjoys	1
oneself	1
Anna	1
said	1
with	1
tender	1
irony	1
It	1
s	1
strange	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
At	1
the	1
Bobrishtchevs	1
one	1
always	1
enjoys	1
oneself	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
Nikitins	1
too	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
Mezhkovs	1
it	1
s	1
always	1
dull	1
Haven	1
t	1
you	1
noticed	1
it	1
No	1
my	1
dear	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
balls	1
now	1
where	1
one	1
enjoys	1
oneself	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
Kitty	1
detected	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
mysterious	1
world	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
open	1
to	1
her	1
For	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
less	1
dull	1
and	1
tiresome	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
dull	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
Why	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
be	1
dull	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
inquired	1
Anna	1
Kitty	1
perceived	1
that	1
Anna	1
knew	1
what	1
answer	1
would	1
follow	1
Because	1
you	1
always	1
look	1
nicer	1
than	1
anyone	1
Anna	1
had	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
blushing	1
She	1
blushed	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
said	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
it	1
s	1
never	1
so	1
and	1
secondly	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
what	1
difference	1
would	1
it	1
make	1
to	1
me	1
Are	1
you	1
coming	1
to	1
this	1
ball	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
I	1
imagine	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
avoid	1
going	1
Here	1
take	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Tanya	1
who	1
was	1
pulling	1
the	1
loosely	1
fitting	1
ring	1
off	1
her	1
white	1
slender	1
tipped	1
finger	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
I	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
Anyway	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
go	1
I	1
shall	1
comfort	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
you	1
Grisha	1
don	1
t	1
pull	1
my	1
hair	1
It	1
s	1
untidy	1
enough	1
without	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
up	1
a	1
straying	1
lock	1
which	1
Grisha	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
with	1
I	1
imagine	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
lilac	1
And	1
why	1
in	1
lilac	1
precisely	1
asked	1
Anna	1
smiling	1
Now	1
children	1
run	1
along	1
run	1
along	1
Do	1
you	1
hear	1
Miss	1
Hoole	1
is	1
calling	1
you	1
to	1
tea	1
she	1
said	1
tearing	1
the	1
children	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
sending	1
them	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
I	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
press	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
You	1
expect	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
this	1
ball	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
everyone	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
Yes	1
Oh	1
what	1
a	1
happy	1
time	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
pursued	1
Anna	1
I	1
remember	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
blue	1
haze	1
like	1
the	1
mist	1
on	1
the	1
mountains	1
in	1
Switzerland	1
That	1
mist	1
which	1
covers	1
everything	1
in	1
that	1
blissful	1
time	1
when	1
childhood	1
is	1
just	1
ending	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
vast	1
circle	1
happy	1
and	1
gay	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
path	1
growing	1
narrower	1
and	1
narrower	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
delightful	1
and	1
alarming	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
ballroom	1
bright	1
and	1
splendid	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
Who	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
through	1
it	1
Kitty	1
smiled	1
without	1
speaking	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
she	1
go	1
through	1
it	1
How	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
her	1
love	1
story	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
recalling	1
the	1
unromantic	1
appearance	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
her	1
husband	1
I	1
know	1
something	1
Stiva	1
told	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
I	1
liked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
Anna	1
continued	1
I	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
Oh	1
was	1
he	1
there	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
blushing	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
Stiva	1
told	1
you	1
Stiva	1
gossiped	1
about	1
it	1
all	1
And	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
glad	1
I	1
traveled	1
yesterday	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
mother	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
talked	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
her	1
favorite	1
I	1
know	1
mothers	1
are	1
partial	1
but	1
What	1
did	1
his	1
mother	1
tell	1
you	1
Oh	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
her	1
favorite	1
still	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
how	1
chivalrous	1
he	1
is	1
Well	1
for	1
instance	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
property	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
child	1
saved	1
a	1
woman	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
hero	1
in	1
fact	1
said	1
Anna	1
smiling	1
and	1
recollecting	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
Kitty	1
about	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
For	1
some	1
reason	1
it	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
something	1
that	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
She	1
pressed	1
me	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
Anna	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
tomorrow	1
Stiva	1
is	1
staying	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
Dolly	1
s	1
room	1
thank	1
God	1
Anna	1
added	1
changing	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
Kitty	1
fancied	1
displeased	1
with	1
something	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
first	1
No	1
I	1
screamed	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
finished	1
tea	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
Aunt	1
Anna	1
All	1
together	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
laughing	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
and	1
embraced	1
and	1
swung	1
round	1
all	1
the	1
throng	1
of	1
swarming	1
children	1
shrieking	1
with	1
delight	1
Chapter	1
21	1
Dolly	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
tea	1
of	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
He	1
must	1
have	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
room	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
cold	1
upstairs	1
observed	1
Dolly	1
addressing	1
Anna	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
move	1
you	1
downstairs	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
nearer	1
Oh	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
trouble	1
about	1
me	1
answered	1
Anna	1
looking	1
intently	1
into	1
Dolly	1
s	1
face	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
or	1
not	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
lighter	1
for	1
you	1
here	1
answered	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
sleep	1
everywhere	1
and	1
always	1
like	1
a	1
marmot	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
question	1
inquired	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
addressing	1
his	1
wife	1
From	1
his	1
tone	1
both	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Anna	1
knew	1
that	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
move	1
Anna	1
downstairs	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
hang	1
up	1
blinds	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
myself	1
answered	1
Dolly	1
addressing	1
him	1
God	1
knows	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
fully	1
reconciled	1
thought	1
Anna	1
hearing	1
her	1
tone	1
cold	1
and	1
composed	1
Oh	1
nonsense	1
Dolly	1
always	1
making	1
difficulties	1
answered	1
her	1
husband	1
Come	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
all	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
Yes	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
reconciled	1
thought	1
Anna	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
you	1
do	1
everything	1
answered	1
Dolly	1
You	1
tell	1
Matvey	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
yourself	1
leaving	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
muddle	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
her	1
habitual	1
mocking	1
smile	1
curved	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
Dolly	1
s	1
lips	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
Full	1
full	1
reconciliation	1
full	1
thought	1
Anna	1
thank	1
God	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Dolly	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
always	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
Matvey	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
hardly	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
addressing	1
his	1
wife	1
The	1
whole	1
evening	1
Dolly	1
was	1
as	1
always	1
a	1
little	1
mocking	1
in	1
her	1
tone	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
while	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
cheerful	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
seem	1
as	1
though	1
having	1
been	1
forgiven	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
his	1
offense	1
At	1
half	1
past	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
a	1
particularly	1
joyful	1
and	1
pleasant	1
family	1
conversation	1
over	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
was	1
broken	1
up	1
by	1
an	1
apparently	1
simple	1
incident	1
But	1
this	1
simple	1
incident	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
struck	1
everyone	1
as	1
strange	1
Talking	1
about	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Anna	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
She	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
album	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
ll	1
show	1
you	1
my	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
mother	1
s	1
smile	1
of	1
pride	1
Towards	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
she	1
usually	1
said	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
often	1
before	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
ball	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
herself	1
she	1
felt	1
depressed	1
at	1
being	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
whatever	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
she	1
kept	1
coming	1
back	1
in	1
thought	1
to	1
her	1
curly	1
headed	1
Seryozha	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
photograph	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
him	1
Seizing	1
the	1
first	1
pretext	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
light	1
resolute	1
step	1
went	1
for	1
her	1
album	1
The	1
stairs	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
warm	1
main	1
staircase	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
a	1
ring	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
Who	1

that	1

said	1
Dolly	1
It	1

for	1

Sure	1

Arkadyevitch	1
When	1
Anna	1
was	1
passing	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
staircase	1
a	1
servant	1
was	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
visitor	1
while	1
the	1
visitor	1
himself	1
was	1
standing	1
under	1
a	1
lamp	1
Anna	1
glancing	1
down	1
at	1
once	1
recognized	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
dread	1
of	1
something	1
stirred	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
still	1
not	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
pulling	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
At	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
facing	1
the	1
stairs	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
there	1
passed	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
dismay	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
inclination	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
passed	1
hearing	1
behind	1
her	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
loud	1
voice	1
calling	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
quiet	1
soft	1
and	1
composed	1
voice	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
refusing	1
When	1
Anna	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
album	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
gone	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
telling	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
to	1
inquire	1
about	1
the	1
dinner	1
they	1
were	1
giving	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
a	1
celebrity	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
And	1
nothing	1
would	1
induce	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
What	1
a	1
queer	1
fellow	1
he	1
is	1
added	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Kitty	1
blushed	1
She	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
knew	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
why	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
home	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
didn	1
t	1
find	1
me	1
and	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
here	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
late	1
and	1
Anna	1
s	1
here	1
All	1
of	1
them	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
saying	1
nothing	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Anna	1
s	1
album	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
either	1
exceptional	1
or	1
strange	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
calling	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
nine	1
on	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
inquire	1
details	1
of	1
a	1
proposed	1
dinner	1
party	1
and	1
not	1
coming	1
in	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
Above	1
all	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange	1
and	1
not	1
right	1
to	1
Anna	1
Chapter	1
22	1
The	1
ball	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
as	1
Kitty	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
walked	1
up	1
the	1
great	1
staircase	1
flooded	1
with	1
light	1
and	1
lined	1
with	1
flowers	1
and	1
footmen	1
in	1
powder	1
and	1
red	1
coats	1
From	1
the	1
rooms	1
came	1
a	1
constant	1
steady	1
hum	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
hive	1
and	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
movement	1
and	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
between	1
trees	1
they	1
gave	1
last	1
touches	1
to	1
their	1
hair	1
and	1
dresses	1
before	1
the	1
mirror	1
they	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
ballroom	1
the	1
careful	1
distinct	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
fiddles	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
beginning	1
the	1
first	1
waltz	1
A	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
civilian	1
dress	1
arranging	1
his	1
gray	1
curls	1
before	1
another	1
mirror	1
and	1
diffusing	1
an	1
odor	1
of	1
scent	1
stumbled	1
against	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
stood	1
aside	1
evidently	1
admiring	1
Kitty	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
A	1
beardless	1
youth	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
society	1
youths	1
whom	1
the	1
old	1
Prince	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
called	1
young	1
bucks	1
in	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
open	1
waistcoat	1
straightening	1
his	1
white	1
tie	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
bowed	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
after	1
running	1
by	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
ask	1
Kitty	1
for	1
a	1
quadrille	1
As	1
the	1
first	1
quadrille	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
promise	1
this	1
youth	1
the	1
second	1
An	1
officer	1
buttoning	1
his	1
glove	1
stood	1
aside	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
mustache	1
admired	1
rosy	1
Kitty	1
Although	1
her	1
dress	1
her	1
coiffure	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
cost	1
Kitty	1
great	1
trouble	1
and	1
consideration	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
she	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom	1
in	1
her	1
elaborate	1
tulle	1
dress	1
over	1
a	1
pink	1
slip	1
as	1
easily	1
and	1
simply	1
as	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
rosettes	1
and	1
lace	1
all	1
the	1
minute	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
attire	1
had	1
not	1
cost	1
her	1
or	1
her	1
family	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
attention	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
that	1
tulle	1
and	1
lace	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
done	1
up	1
high	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
rose	1
and	1
two	1
leaves	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
When	1
just	1
before	1
entering	1
the	1
ballroom	1
the	1
princess	1
her	1
mother	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
right	1
side	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ribbon	1
of	1
her	1
sash	1
Kitty	1
had	1
drawn	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
right	1
of	1
itself	1
and	1
graceful	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
need	1
setting	1
straight	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
best	1
days	1
Her	1
dress	1
was	1
not	1
uncomfortable	1
anywhere	1
her	1
lace	1
berthe	1
did	1
not	1
droop	1
anywhere	1
her	1
rosettes	1
were	1
not	1
crushed	1
nor	1
torn	1
off	1
her	1
pink	1
slippers	1
with	1
high	1
hollowed	1
out	1
heels	1
did	1
not	1
pinch	1
but	1
gladdened	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
thick	1
rolls	1
of	1
fair	1
chignon	1
kept	1
up	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
her	1
own	1
hair	1
All	1
the	1
three	1
buttons	1
buttoned	1
up	1
without	1
tearing	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
glove	1
that	1
covered	1
her	1
hand	1
without	1
concealing	1
its	1
lines	1
The	1
black	1
velvet	1
of	1
her	1
locket	1
nestled	1
with	1
special	1
softness	1
round	1
her	1
neck	1
That	1
velvet	1
was	1
delicious	1
at	1
home	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
neck	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
Kitty	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
that	1
velvet	1
was	1
speaking	1
About	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
doubt	1
but	1
the	1
velvet	1
was	1
delicious	1
Kitty	1
smiled	1
here	1
too	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
when	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
Her	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
and	1
arms	1
gave	1
Kitty	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
chill	1
marble	1
a	1
feeling	1
she	1
particularly	1
liked	1
Her	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
and	1
her	1
rosy	1
lips	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
from	1
smiling	1
from	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
attractiveness	1
She	1
had	1
scarcely	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
throng	1
of	1
ladies	1
all	1
tulle	1
ribbons	1
lace	1
and	1
flowers	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
dance	1
Kitty	1
was	1
never	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
throng	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
waltz	1
and	1
asked	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
partner	1
the	1
first	1
star	1
in	1
the	1
hierarchy	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
a	1
renowned	1
director	1
of	1
dances	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
handsome	1
and	1
well	1
built	1
Yegorushka	1
Korsunsky	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
left	1
the	1
Countess	1
Bonina	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
the	1
first	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
waltz	1
and	1
scanning	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
couples	1
who	1
had	1
started	1
dancing	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Kitty	1
entering	1
and	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
easy	1
amble	1
which	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
directors	1
of	1
balls	1
Without	1
even	1
asking	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
cared	1
to	1
dance	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
encircle	1
her	1
slender	1
waist	1
She	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
someone	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
fan	1
to	1
and	1
their	1
hostess	1
smiling	1
to	1
her	1
took	1
it	1
How	1
nice	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
embracing	1
her	1
waist	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
habit	1
to	1
be	1
late	1
Bending	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
she	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
pink	1
slippers	1
began	1
swiftly	1
lightly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
moving	1
over	1
the	1
slippery	1
floor	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
rest	1
to	1
waltz	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
they	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
slow	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
waltz	1
It	1
s	1
exquisite	1
such	1
lightness	1
precision	1
He	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
partners	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
well	1
She	1
smiled	1
at	1
his	1
praise	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
girl	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
ball	1
for	1
whom	1
all	1
faces	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
melt	1
into	1
one	1
vision	1
of	1
fairyland	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
stale	1
round	1
of	1
balls	1
till	1
every	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom	1
was	1
familiar	1
and	1
tiresome	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
stage	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
she	1
was	1
excited	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
sufficient	1
self	1
possession	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
observe	1
In	1
the	1
left	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
society	1
gathered	1
together	1
There	1
incredibly	1
naked	1
was	1
the	1
beauty	1
Lidi	1
Korsunsky	1
s	1
wife	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
shone	1
the	1
bald	1
head	1
of	1
Krivin	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
where	1
the	1
best	1
people	1
were	1
In	1
that	1
direction	1
gazed	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
not	1
venturing	1
to	1
approach	1
There	1
too	1
she	1
descried	1
Stiva	1
and	1
there	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
exquisite	1
figure	1
and	1
head	1
of	1
Anna	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
velvet	1
gown	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
Kitty	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
the	1
evening	1
she	1
refused	1
Levin	1
With	1
her	1
long	1
sighted	1
eyes	1
she	1
knew	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
Another	1
turn	1
eh	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
tired	1
said	1
Korsunsky	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
No	1
thank	1
you	1
Where	1
shall	1
I	1
take	1
you	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
s	1
here	1
I	1
think	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
Wherever	1
you	1
command	1
And	1
Korsunsky	1
began	1
waltzing	1
with	1
measured	1
steps	1
straight	1
towards	1
the	1
group	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
corner	1
continually	1
saying	1
Pardon	1
mesdames	1
pardon	1
pardon	1
mesdames	1
and	1
steering	1
his	1
course	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
lace	1
tulle	1
and	1
ribbon	1
and	1
not	1
disarranging	1
a	1
feather	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
partner	1
sharply	1
round	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
slim	1
ankles	1
in	1
light	1
transparent	1
stockings	1
were	1
exposed	1
to	1
view	1
and	1
her	1
train	1
floated	1
out	1
in	1
fan	1
shape	1
and	1
covered	1
Krivin	1
s	1
knees	1
Korsunsky	1
bowed	1
set	1
straight	1
his	1
open	1
shirt	1
front	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
conduct	1
her	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
Kitty	1
flushed	1
took	1
her	1
train	1
from	1
Krivin	1
s	1
knees	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
giddy	1
looked	1
round	1
seeking	1
Anna	1
Anna	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
lilac	1
as	1
Kitty	1
had	1
so	1
urgently	1
wished	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
low	1
cut	1
velvet	1
gown	1
showing	1
her	1
full	1
throat	1
and	1
shoulders	1
that	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
carved	1
in	1
old	1
ivory	1
and	1
her	1
rounded	1
arms	1
with	1
tiny	1
slender	1
wrists	1
The	1
whole	1
gown	1
was	1
trimmed	1
with	1
Venetian	1
guipure	1
On	1
her	1
head	1
among	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
her	1
own	1
with	1
no	1
false	1
additions	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
wreath	1
of	1
pansies	1
and	1
a	1
bouquet	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
ribbon	1
of	1
her	1
sash	1
among	1
white	1
lace	1
Her	1
coiffure	1
was	1
not	1
striking	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
noticeable	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
wilful	1
tendrils	1
of	1
her	1
curly	1
hair	1
that	1
would	1
always	1
break	1
free	1
about	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
temples	1
Round	1
her	1
well	1
cut	1
strong	1

was	1
a	1
thread	1
of	1
pearls	1
Kitty	1
had	1
been	1
seeing	1
Anna	1
every	1
day	1
she	1
adored	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
pictured	1
her	1
invariably	1
in	1
lilac	1
But	1
now	1
seeing	1
her	1
in	1
black	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
fully	1
seen	1
her	1
charm	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
someone	1
quite	1
new	1
and	1
surprising	1
to	1
her	1
Now	1
she	1
understood	1
that	1
Anna	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
lilac	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
charm	1
was	1
just	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
stood	1
out	1
against	1
her	1
attire	1
that	1
her	1
dress	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
noticeable	1
on	1
her	1
And	1
her	1
black	1
dress	1
with	1
its	1
sumptuous	1
lace	1
was	1
not	1
noticeable	1
on	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
frame	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
seen	1
was	1
she	1
simple	1
natural	1
elegant	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
gay	1
and	1
eager	1
She	1
was	1
standing	1
holding	1
herself	1
as	1
always	1
very	1
erect	1
and	1
when	1
Kitty	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
group	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
her	1
head	1
slightly	1
turned	1
towards	1
him	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
throw	1
stones	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
something	1
though	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
smile	1
of	1
protection	1
towards	1
Kitty	1
With	1
a	1
flying	1
feminine	1
glance	1
she	1
scanned	1
her	1
attire	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
but	1
understood	1
by	1
Kitty	1
signifying	1
approval	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
looks	1
You	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
dancing	1
she	1
added	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
most	1
faithful	1
supporters	1
said	1
Korsunsky	1
bowing	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
The	1

helps	1
to	1
make	1

and	1
successful	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
a	1
waltz	1
he	1
said	1
bending	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
Why	1
have	1
you	1
met	1
inquired	1
their	1
host	1
Is	1
there	1
anyone	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
met	1
My	1
wife	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
like	1
white	1
wolves	1
everyone	1
knows	1
us	1
answered	1
Korsunsky	1
A	1
waltz	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
dance	1
when	1
it	1
s	1
possible	1
not	1
to	1
dance	1
she	1
said	1
But	1
tonight	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
answered	1
Korsunsky	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
Vronsky	1
came	1
up	1
Well	1
since	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
tonight	1
let	1
us	1
start	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
noticing	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
bow	1
and	1
she	1
hastily	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
Korsunsky	1
s	1
shoulder	1
What	1
is	1
she	1
vexed	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
discerning	1
that	1
Anna	1
had	1
intentionally	1
not	1
responded	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
bow	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kitty	1
reminding	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
quadrille	1
and	1
expressing	1
his	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
Kitty	1
gazed	1
in	1
admiration	1
at	1
Anna	1
waltzing	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
She	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
waltz	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
wonderingly	1
at	1
him	1
He	1
flushed	1
slightly	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
waltz	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
put	1
his	1
arm	1
round	1
her	1
waist	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
when	1
the	1
music	1
suddenly	1
stopped	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
long	1
afterwards	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
after	1
that	1
look	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
response	1
cut	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
with	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
shame	1
Pardon	1

from	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

Chapter	1

Vronsky	1
and	1
Kitty	1
waltzed	1
several	1
times	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
After	1
the	1
first	1
waltz	1
Kitty	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
hardly	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
when	1
Vronsky	1
came	1
up	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
quadrille	1
During	1
the	1
quadrille	1
nothing	1
of	1
any	1
significance	1
was	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
disjointed	1
talk	1
between	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Korsunskys	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
whom	1
he	1
described	1
very	1
amusingly	1
as	1
delightful	1
children	1
at	1
forty	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
town	1
theater	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
the	1
conversation	1
touched	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
Levin	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
But	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
quadrille	1
She	1
looked	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
thrill	1
at	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
mazurka	1
She	1
fancied	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
mazurka	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
decided	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
during	1
the	1
quadrille	1
ask	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
mazurka	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
her	1
She	1
felt	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
dance	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
former	1
balls	1
and	1
refused	1
five	1
young	1
men	1
saying	1
she	1
was	1
engaged	1
for	1
the	1
mazurka	1
The	1
whole	1
ball	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
quadrille	1
was	1
for	1
Kitty	1
an	1
enchanted	1
vision	1
of	1
delightful	1
colors	1
sounds	1
and	1
motions	1
She	1
only	1
sat	1
down	1
when	1
she	1
felt	1
too	1
tired	1
and	1
begged	1
for	1
a	1
rest	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
the	1
last	1
quadrille	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tiresome	1
young	1
men	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
she	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
vis	1
`a	1
vis	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
near	1
Anna	1
again	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
suddenly	1
quite	1
new	1
and	1
surprising	1
She	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
that	1
excitement	1
of	1
success	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
herself	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
intoxicated	1
with	1
the	1
delighted	1
admiration	1
she	1
was	1
exciting	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
feeling	1
and	1
knew	1
its	1
signs	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
Anna	1
saw	1
the	1
quivering	1
flashing	1
light	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
excitement	1
unconsciously	1
playing	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
deliberate	1
grace	1
precision	1
and	1
lightness	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
Who	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
All	1
or	1
one	1
And	1
not	1
assisting	1
the	1
harassed	1
young	1
man	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
pick	1
up	1
again	1
she	1
obeyed	1
with	1
external	1
liveliness	1
the	1
peremptory	1
shouts	1
of	1
Korsunsky	1
starting	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
the	1
grand	1
rond	1
and	1
then	1
into	1
the	1
cha^ine	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
kept	1
watch	1
with	1
a	1
growing	1
pang	1
at	1
her	1
heart	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
has	1
intoxicated	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
adoration	1
of	1
one	1
And	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
he	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
Anna	1
the	1
joyous	1
light	1
flashed	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
curved	1
her	1
red	1
lips	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
to	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
delight	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
of	1
themselves	1
But	1
what	1
of	1
him	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
terror	1
What	1
was	1
pictured	1
so	1
clearly	1
to	1
Kitty	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
him	1
What	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
always	1
self	1
possessed	1
resolute	1
manner	1
and	1
the	1
carelessly	1
serene	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
Now	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
humble	1
submission	1
and	1
dread	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
offend	1
you	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
every	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
saying	1
but	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
save	1
myself	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
On	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
such	1
as	1
Kitty	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
They	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
most	1
trivial	1
conversation	1
but	1
to	1
Kitty	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
every	1
word	1
they	1
said	1
was	1
determining	1
their	1
fate	1
and	1
hers	1
And	1
strange	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
actually	1
talking	1
of	1
how	1
absurd	1
Ivan	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
French	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
Eletsky	1
girl	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
better	1
match	1
yet	1
these	1
words	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
consequence	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
feeling	1
just	1
as	1
Kitty	1
did	1
The	1
whole	1
ball	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
everything	1
seemed	1
lost	1
in	1
fog	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
soul	1
Nothing	1
but	1
the	1
stern	1
discipline	1
of	1
her	1
bringing	1
up	1
supported	1
her	1
and	1
forced	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
dance	1
to	1
answer	1
questions	1
to	1
talk	1
even	1
to	1
smile	1
But	1
before	1
the	1
mazurka	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
rearrange	1
the	1
chairs	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
couples	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
rooms	1
into	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
horror	1
came	1
for	1
Kitty	1
She	1
had	1
refused	1
five	1
partners	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
dancing	1
the	1
mazurka	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
asked	1
for	1
it	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
successful	1
in	1
society	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
would	1
never	1
occur	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
remained	1
disengaged	1
till	1
now	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
felt	1
ill	1
and	1
go	1
home	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
She	1
felt	1
crushed	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
furthest	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
Her	1
light	1
transparent	1
skirts	1
rose	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
about	1
her	1
slender	1
waist	1
one	1
bare	1
thin	1
soft	1
girlish	1
arm	1
hanging	1
listlessly	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
pink	1
tunic	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
held	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
with	1
rapid	1
short	1
strokes	1
fanned	1
her	1
burning	1
face	1
But	1
while	1
she	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
butterfly	1
clinging	1
to	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
open	1
its	1
rainbow	1
wings	1
for	1
fresh	1
flight	1
her	1
heart	1
ached	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
despair	1
But	1
perhaps	1
I	1
am	1
wrong	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
recalled	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Kitty	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
stepping	1
noiselessly	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
towards	1
her	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
Kitty	1
s	1
lower	1
lip	1
began	1
to	1
quiver	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
Kitty	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
dancing	1
the	1
mazurka	1
No	1
no	1
said	1
Kitty	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
shaking	1
with	1
tears	1
He	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
mazurka	1
before	1
me	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
knowing	1
Kitty	1
would	1
understand	1
who	1
were	1
he	1
and	1
her	1
She	1
said	1
Why	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
dance	1
it	1
with	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
answered	1
Kitty	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
she	1
herself	1
understood	1
her	1
position	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
refused	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
perhaps	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
refused	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
faith	1
in	1
another	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
found	1
Korsunsky	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
dance	1
the	1
mazurka	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
Kitty	1
Kitty	1
danced	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
couple	1
and	1
luckily	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
talk	1
because	1
Korsunsky	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
running	1
about	1
directing	1
the	1
figure	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
sat	1
almost	1
opposite	1
her	1
She	1
saw	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
long	1
sighted	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
too	1
close	1
by	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
figures	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
she	1
saw	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
was	1
she	1
that	1
her	1
unhappiness	1
was	1
complete	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
felt	1
themselves	1
alone	1
in	1
that	1
crowded	1
room	1
And	1
on	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
always	1
so	1
firm	1
and	1
independent	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
look	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
her	1
of	1
bewilderment	1
and	1
humble	1
submissiveness	1
like	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
intelligent	1
dog	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
wrong	1
Anna	1
smiled	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
was	1
reflected	1
by	1
him	1
She	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
serious	1
Some	1
supernatural	1
force	1
drew	1
Kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
to	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
She	1
was	1
fascinating	1
in	1
her	1
simple	1
black	1
dress	1
fascinating	1
were	1
her	1
round	1
arms	1
with	1
their	1
bracelets	1
fascinating	1
was	1
her	1
firm	1
neck	1
with	1
its	1
thread	1
of	1
pearls	1
fascinating	1
the	1
straying	1
curls	1
of	1
her	1
loose	1
hair	1
fascinating	1
the	1
graceful	1
light	1
movements	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
feet	1
and	1
hands	1
fascinating	1
was	1
that	1
lovely	1
face	1
in	1
its	1
eagerness	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
cruel	1
in	1
her	1
fascination	1
Kitty	1
admired	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
acute	1
was	1
her	1
suffering	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
overwhelmed	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
showed	1
it	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
her	1
coming	1
across	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
mazurka	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
recognize	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
changed	1
Delightful	1
ball	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
Yes	1
she	1
answered	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
mazurka	1
repeating	1
a	1
complicated	1
figure	1
newly	1
invented	1
by	1
Korsunsky	1
Anna	1
came	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
chose	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
summoned	1
a	1
lady	1
and	1
Kitty	1
Kitty	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
dismay	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
Anna	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
drooping	1
eyelids	1
and	1
smiled	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
But	1
noticing	1
that	1
Kitty	1
only	1
responded	1
to	1
her	1
smile	1
by	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
amazement	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
began	1
gaily	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
lady	1
Yes	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
uncanny	1
devilish	1
and	1
fascinating	1
in	1
her	1
Kitty	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
stay	1
to	1
supper	1
but	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
began	1
to	1
press	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
Nonsense	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
said	1
Korsunsky	1
drawing	1
her	1
bare	1
arm	1
under	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
dress	1
coat	1
I	1
ve	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
for	1
a	1
cotillion	1
Un	1
bijou	1
	1
And	1
he	1
moved	1
gradually	1
on	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
Their	1
host	1
smiled	1
approvingly	1
No	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
answered	1
Anna	1
smiling	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
smile	1
both	1
Korsunsky	1
and	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
saw	1
from	1
her	1
resolute	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
stay	1
No	1
why	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
have	1
danced	1
more	1
at	1
your	1
ball	1
in	1
Moscow	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
said	1
Anna	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
stood	1
near	1
her	1
I	1
must	1
rest	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
my	1
journey	1
Are	1
you	1
certainly	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
then	1
asked	1
Vronsky	1
Yes	1
I	1
suppose	1
so	1
answered	1
Anna	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
his	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
irrepressible	1
quivering	1
brilliance	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
fire	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
to	1
supper	1
but	1
went	1
home	1
Chapter	1
24	1
Yes	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
me	1
hateful	1
repulsive	1
thought	1
Levin	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
lodgings	1
And	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
other	1
people	1
Pride	1
they	1
say	1
No	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pride	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
pride	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
put	1
myself	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
And	1
he	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
Vronsky	1
happy	1
good	1
natured	1
clever	1
and	1
self	1
possessed	1
certainly	1
never	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
awful	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
evening	1
Yes	1
she	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
choose	1
him	1
So	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
complain	1
of	1
anyone	1
or	1
anything	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
to	1
blame	1
What	1
right	1
had	1
I	1
to	1
imagine	1
she	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
mine	1
Who	1
am	1
I	1
and	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
A	1
nobody	1
not	1
wanted	1
by	1
anyone	1
nor	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
anybody	1
And	1
he	1
recalled	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
and	1
dwelt	1
with	1
pleasure	1
on	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
Isn	1
t	1
he	1
right	1
that	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
base	1
and	1
loathsome	1
And	1
are	1
we	1
fair	1
in	1
our	1
judgment	1
of	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
Of	1
course	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
Prokofy	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
torn	1
cloak	1
and	1
tipsy	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
despicable	1
person	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
differently	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
like	1
him	1
And	1
I	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
seek	1
him	1
out	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
came	1
here	1
Levin	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
lamppost	1
read	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
address	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
and	1
called	1
a	1
sledge	1
All	1
the	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
Levin	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
life	1
He	1
remembered	1
how	1
his	1
brother	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
afterwards	1
had	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
jeers	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
lived	1
like	1
a	1
monk	1
strictly	1
observing	1
all	1
religious	1
rites	1
services	1
and	1
fasts	1
and	1
avoiding	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
pleasure	1
especially	1
women	1
And	1
afterwards	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
broken	1
out	1
he	1
had	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
people	1
and	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
senseless	1
debauchery	1
He	1
remembered	1
later	1
the	1
scandal	1
over	1
a	1
boy	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
rage	1
had	1
so	1
violently	1
beaten	1
that	1
proceedings	1
were	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
unlawfully	1
wounding	1
Then	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
scandal	1
with	1
a	1
sharper	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
money	1
and	1
given	1
a	1
promissory	1
note	1
and	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
lodged	1
a	1
complaint	1
asserting	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
cheated	1
him	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
money	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
paid	1
Then	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
lockup	1
for	1
disorderly	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
shameful	1
proceedings	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
against	1
his	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
accusing	1
him	1
of	1
not	1
having	1
paid	1
him	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
fortune	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
scandal	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
western	1
province	1
in	1
an	1
official	1
capacity	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
trouble	1
for	1
assaulting	1
a	1
village	1
elder	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
horribly	1
disgusting	1
yet	1
to	1
Levin	1
it	1
appeared	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
disgusting	1
light	1
as	1
it	1
inevitably	1
would	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Nikolay	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
all	1
his	1
story	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
his	1
heart	1
Levin	1
remembered	1
that	1
when	1
Nikolay	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
devout	1
stage	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
fasts	1
and	1
monks	1
and	1
church	1
services	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
seeking	1
in	1
religion	1
a	1
support	1
and	1
a	1
curb	1
for	1
his	1
passionate	1
temperament	1
everyone	1
far	1
from	1
encouraging	1
him	1
had	1
jeered	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
They	1
had	1
teased	1
him	1
called	1
him	1
Noah	1
and	1
monk	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
out	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
helped	1
him	1
but	1
everyone	1
had	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ugliness	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
than	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
despised	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
born	1
with	1
his	1
unbridled	1
temperament	1
and	1
his	1
somehow	1
limited	1
intelligence	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
everything	1
without	1
reserve	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
speak	1
without	1
reserve	1
too	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
understand	1
him	1
Levin	1
resolved	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
towards	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
hotel	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
address	1
At	1
the	1
top	1
12	1
and	1
13	1
the	1
porter	1
answered	1
Levin	1
s	1
inquiry	1
At	1
home	1
Sure	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
No	1
12	1
was	1
half	1
open	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streak	1
of	1
light	1
thick	1
fumes	1
of	1
cheap	1
poor	1
tobacco	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
voice	1
unknown	1
to	1
Levin	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
there	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
cough	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
unknown	1
voice	1
was	1
saying	1
It	1
all	1
depends	1
with	1
how	1
much	1
judgment	1
and	1
knowledge	1
the	1
thing	1
s	1
done	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
looked	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
immense	1
shock	1
of	1
hair	1
wearing	1
a	1
Russian	1
jerkin	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
pockmarked	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
woolen	1
gown	1
without	1
collar	1
or	1
cuffs	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
His	1
brother	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
Konstantin	1
felt	1
a	1
sharp	1
pang	1
at	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
company	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
brother	1
spent	1
his	1
life	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
Konstantin	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
galoshes	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
jerkin	1
was	1
saying	1
He	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
some	1
enterprise	1
Well	1
the	1
devil	1
flay	1
them	1
the	1
privileged	1
classes	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
voice	1
responded	1
with	1
a	1
cough	1
Masha	1
get	1
us	1
some	1
supper	1
and	1
some	1
wine	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
any	1
left	1
or	1
else	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
some	1
The	1
woman	1
rose	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
and	1
saw	1
Konstantin	1
There	1
s	1
some	1
gentleman	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
she	1
said	1
Whom	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
angrily	1
It	1
s	1
I	1
answered	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
coming	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
Who	1
s	1
I	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
voice	1
said	1
again	1
still	1
more	1
angrily	1
He	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
getting	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
stumbling	1
against	1
something	1
and	1
Levin	1
saw	1
facing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
big	1
scared	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
huge	1
thin	1
stooping	1
figure	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
so	1
familiar	1
and	1
yet	1
astonishing	1
in	1
its	1
weirdness	1
and	1
sickliness	1
He	1
was	1
even	1
thinner	1
than	1
three	1
years	1
before	1
when	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
last	1
He	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
big	1
bones	1
seemed	1
huger	1
than	1
ever	1
His	1
hair	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner	1
the	1
same	1
straight	1
mustaches	1
hid	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
same	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
strangely	1
and	1
na"ively	1
at	1
his	1
visitor	1
Ah	1
Kostya	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
suddenly	1
recognizing	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
joy	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
second	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
nervous	1
jerk	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
neck	1
that	1
Konstantin	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
neckband	1
hurt	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
expression	1
wild	1
suffering	1
and	1
cruel	1
rested	1
on	1
his	1
emaciated	1
face	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
both	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
you	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Konstantin	1
had	1
been	1
fancying	1
him	1
The	1
worst	1
and	1
most	1
tiresome	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
what	1
made	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
so	1
difficult	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
by	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
nervous	1
twitching	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
remembered	1
it	1
all	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
he	1
answered	1
timidly	1
I	1
ve	1
simply	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
His	1
brother	1
s	1
timidity	1
obviously	1
softened	1
Nikolay	1
His	1
lips	1
twitched	1
Oh	1
so	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
Well	1
come	1
in	1
sit	1
down	1
Like	1
some	1
supper	1
Masha	1
bring	1
supper	1
for	1
three	1
No	1
stop	1
a	1
minute	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
this	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
indicating	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
jerkin	1
This	1
is	1
Mr	1
Kritsky	1
my	1
friend	1
from	1
Kiev	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
man	1
He	1
s	1
persecuted	1
by	1
the	1
police	1
of	1
course	1
because	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
at	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
Seeing	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
was	1
moving	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
her	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
I	1
said	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
inability	1
to	1
express	1
himself	1
the	1
incoherence	1
that	1
Konstantin	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
another	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
everyone	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
brother	1
Kritsky	1
s	1
story	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
expelled	1
from	1
the	1
university	1
for	1
starting	1
a	1
benefit	1
society	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
students	1
and	1
Sunday	1
schools	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
afterwards	1
been	1
a	1
teacher	1
in	1
a	1
peasant	1
school	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
too	1
and	1
had	1
afterwards	1
been	1
condemned	1
for	1
something	1
You	1
re	1
of	1
the	1
Kiev	1
university	1
said	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
to	1
Kritsky	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
awkward	1
silence	1
that	1
followed	1
Yes	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
Kiev	1
Kritsky	1
replied	1
angrily	1
his	1
face	1
darkening	1
And	1
this	1
woman	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
interrupted	1
him	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
is	1
the	1
partner	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
I	1
took	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
house	1
and	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
neck	1
saying	1
this	1
but	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
respect	1
her	1
and	1
anyone	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
he	1
added	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows	1
I	1
beg	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
respect	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
my	1
wife	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
So	1
now	1
you	1
know	1
whom	1
you	1
ve	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
you	1
re	1
lowering	1
yourself	1
well	1
here	1
s	1
the	1
floor	1
there	1
s	1
the	1
door	1
And	1
again	1
his	1
eyes	1
traveled	1
inquiringly	1
over	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
Why	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
lowering	1
myself	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
Then	1
Masha	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
supper	1
three	1
portions	1
spirits	1
and	1
wine	1
No	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
No	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
matter	1
Go	1
along	1
Chapter	1
25	1
So	1
you	1
see	1
pursued	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
painfully	1
wrinkling	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
twitching	1
It	1
was	1
obviously	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
do	1
Here	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
iron	1
bars	1
fastened	1
together	1
with	1
strings	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
thing	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
into	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
productive	1
association	1
Konstantin	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
him	1
He	1
looked	1
into	1
his	1
sickly	1
consumptive	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
force	1
himself	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
association	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
association	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
anchor	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
self	1
contempt	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
capital	1
oppresses	1
the	1
laborer	1
The	1
laborers	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
peasants	1
bear	1
all	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
labor	1
and	1
are	1
so	1
placed	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
they	1
work	1
they	1
can	1
t	1
escape	1
from	1
their	1
position	1
of	1
beasts	1
of	1
burden	1
All	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
labor	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
improve	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
gain	1
leisure	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
education	1
all	1
the	1
surplus	1
values	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
capitalists	1
And	1
society	1
s	1
so	1
constituted	1
that	1
the	1
harder	1
they	1
work	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
the	1
merchants	1
and	1
landowners	1
while	1
they	1
stay	1
beasts	1
of	1
burden	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
And	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
changed	1
he	1
finished	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
Yes	1
of	1
course	1
said	1
Konstantin	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
red	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
projecting	1
cheekbones	1
And	1
so	1
we	1
re	1
founding	1
a	1
locksmiths	1
association	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
production	1
and	1
profit	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
instruments	1
of	1
production	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
common	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
association	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
In	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Vozdrem	1
Kazan	1
government	1
But	1
why	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
In	1
the	1
villages	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
work	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
Why	1
a	1
locksmiths	1
association	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
Why	1
Because	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
slaves	1
as	1
they	1
ever	1
were	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
you	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
people	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
get	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
slavery	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
exasperated	1
by	1
the	1
objection	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
sighed	1
looking	1
meanwhile	1
about	1
the	1
cheerless	1
and	1
dirty	1
room	1
This	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
to	1
exasperate	1
Nikolay	1
still	1
more	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
aristocratic	1
views	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
applies	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
to	1
justify	1
existing	1
evils	1
No	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
for	1
said	1
Levin	1
smiling	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
for	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
shrieked	1
suddenly	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
for	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
There	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
You	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
welcome	1
to	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
in	1
God	1
s	1
name	1
go	1
away	1
he	1
shrieked	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
And	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
said	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
timidly	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
even	1
dispute	1
it	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
came	1
back	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
looked	1
round	1
angrily	1
at	1
her	1
She	1
went	1
quickly	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
well	1
I	1
ve	1
grown	1
irritable	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
getting	1
calmer	1
and	1
breathing	1
painfully	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
his	1
article	1
It	1
s	1
such	1
rubbish	1
such	1
lying	1
such	1
self	1
deception	1
What	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
write	1
of	1
justice	1
who	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
Have	1
you	1
read	1
his	1
article	1
he	1
asked	1
Kritsky	1
sitting	1
down	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
moving	1
back	1
off	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
scattered	1
cigarettes	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
clear	1
a	1
space	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
read	1
it	1
Kritsky	1
responded	1
gloomily	1
obviously	1
not	1
desiring	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
Why	1
not	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
now	1
turning	1
with	1
exasperation	1
upon	1
Kritsky	1
Because	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
see	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
wasting	1
my	1
time	1
over	1
it	1
Oh	1
but	1
excuse	1
me	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wasting	1
your	1
time	1
That	1
article	1
s	1
too	1
deep	1
for	1
many	1
people	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
But	1
with	1
me	1
it	1
s	1
another	1
thing	1
I	1
see	1
through	1
his	1
ideas	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
its	1
weakness	1
lies	1
Everyone	1
was	1
mute	1
Kritsky	1
got	1
up	1
deliberately	1
and	1
reached	1
his	1
cap	1
Won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
supper	1
All	1
right	1
good	1
bye	1
Come	1
round	1
tomorrow	1
with	1
the	1
locksmith	1
Kritsky	1
had	1
hardly	1
gone	1
out	1
when	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
and	1
winked	1
He	1
s	1
no	1
good	1
either	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
see	1
of	1
course	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
Kritsky	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
called	1
him	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
Left	1
alone	1
with	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
Levin	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
long	1
with	1
my	1
brother	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Yes	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
year	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
s	1
health	1
has	1
become	1
very	1
poor	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
drinks	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
she	1
said	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
does	1
he	1
drink	1
Drinks	1
vodka	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
bad	1
for	1
him	1
And	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
whispered	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
timidly	1
towards	1
the	1
doorway	1
where	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
had	1
reappeared	1
What	1
were	1
you	1
talking	1
about	1
he	1
said	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
scared	1
eyes	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
Konstantin	1
answered	1
in	1
confusion	1
Oh	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
don	1
t	1
Only	1
it	1
s	1
no	1
good	1
your	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
wench	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
gentleman	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
You	1
understand	1
everything	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
stock	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
look	1
with	1
commiseration	1
on	1
my	1
shortcomings	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
whispered	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
again	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
Oh	1
very	1
well	1
very	1
well	1
But	1
where	1
s	1
the	1
supper	1
Ah	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
seeing	1
a	1
waiter	1
with	1
a	1
tray	1
Here	1
set	1
it	1
here	1
he	1
added	1
angrily	1
and	1
promptly	1
seizing	1
the	1
vodka	1
he	1
poured	1
out	1
a	1
glassful	1
and	1
drank	1
it	1
greedily	1
Like	1
a	1
drink	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
became	1
better	1
humored	1
Well	1
enough	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1

After	1
all	1

and	1

Come	1

he	1
went	1
on	1
greedily	1
munching	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
pouring	1
out	1
another	1
glassful	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
living	1
I	1
live	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
I	1
m	1
busy	1
looking	1
after	1
the	1
land	1
answered	1
Konstantin	1
watching	1
with	1
horror	1
the	1
greediness	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
brother	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
conceal	1
that	1
he	1
noticed	1
it	1
Why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
get	1
married	1
It	1
hasn	1
t	1
happened	1
so	1
Konstantin	1
answered	1
reddening	1
a	1
little	1
Why	1
not	1
For	1
me	1
now	1
everything	1
s	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
I	1
ve	1
made	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
ve	1
said	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
still	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
share	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
needed	1
it	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
Konstantin	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
your	1
little	1
Vanya	1
s	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
clerk	1
in	1
the	1
countinghouse	1
at	1
Pokrovskoe	1
Nikolay	1
jerked	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
thought	1
Yes	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
s	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
Pokrovskoe	1
Is	1
the	1
house	1
standing	1
still	1
and	1
the	1
birch	1
trees	1
and	1
our	1
schoolroom	1
And	1
Philip	1
the	1
gardener	1
is	1
he	1
living	1
How	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
arbor	1
and	1
the	1
seat	1
Now	1
mind	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
alter	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
get	1
married	1
and	1
make	1
everything	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
again	1
Then	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
if	1
your	1
wife	1
is	1
nice	1
But	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
said	1
Levin	1
How	1
nicely	1
we	1
would	1
arrange	1
it	1
I	1
d	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
find	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
find	1
him	1
there	1
I	1
live	1
quite	1
independently	1
of	1
him	1
Yes	1
but	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
like	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
choose	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
timidly	1
into	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
face	1
This	1
timidity	1
touched	1
Konstantin	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
confession	1
of	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
your	1
quarrel	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
take	1
neither	1
side	1
You	1
re	1
both	1
wrong	1
You	1
re	1
more	1
wrong	1
externally	1
and	1
he	1
inwardly	1
Ah	1
ah	1
You	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
Nikolay	1
shouted	1
joyfully	1
But	1
I	1
personally	1
value	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
you	1
more	1
because	1
Why	1
why	1
Konstantin	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
valued	1
it	1
more	1
because	1
Nikolay	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
needed	1
affection	1
But	1
Nikolay	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
scowling	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
vodka	1
again	1
Enough	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
said	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
stretching	1
out	1
her	1
plump	1
bare	1
arm	1
towards	1
the	1
decanter	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
Don	1
t	1
insist	1
I	1
ll	1
beat	1
you	1
he	1
shouted	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
smiled	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
reflected	1
on	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
she	1
understands	1
nothing	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
She	1
understands	1
it	1
all	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
true	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
good	1
and	1
sweet	1
in	1
her	1
Were	1
you	1
never	1
before	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Konstantin	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
Only	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
polite	1
and	1
stiff	1
with	1
her	1
It	1
frightens	1
her	1
No	1
one	1
ever	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
but	1
the	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
who	1
tried	1
her	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
ill	1
fame	1
Mercy	1
on	1
us	1
the	1
senselessness	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
cried	1
suddenly	1
These	1
new	1
institutions	1
these	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
rural	1
councils	1
what	1
hideousness	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
enlarge	1
on	1
his	1
encounters	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
institutions	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
disbelief	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
all	1
public	1
institutions	1
which	1
he	1
shared	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
often	1
expressed	1
was	1
distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
from	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
lips	1
In	1
another	1
world	1
we	1
shall	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
lightly	1
In	1
another	1
world	1
Ah	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
that	1
other	1
world	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
letting	1
his	1
scared	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
eyes	1
Here	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
baseness	1
and	1
the	1
mess	1
one	1
s	1
own	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
of	1
death	1
awfully	1
afraid	1
of	1
death	1
He	1
shuddered	1
But	1
do	1
drink	1
something	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
some	1
champagne	1
Or	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
somewhere	1
Let	1
s	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Gypsies	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
Gypsies	1
and	1
Russian	1
songs	1
His	1
speech	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
falter	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
abruptly	1
from	1
one	1
subject	1
to	1
another	1
Konstantin	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
Masha	1
persuaded	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
anywhere	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
hopelessly	1
drunk	1
Masha	1
promised	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
Konstantin	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
need	1
and	1
to	1
persuade	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
stay	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
Chapter	1
26	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
left	1
Moscow	1
and	1
towards	1
evening	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
On	1
the	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
neighbors	1
about	1
politics	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
railways	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
confusion	1
of	1
ideas	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
himself	1
shame	1
of	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
station	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
one	1
eyed	1
coachman	1
Ignat	1
with	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
turned	1
up	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
reflected	1
by	1
the	1
station	1
fires	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
sledge	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
with	1
their	1
tails	1
tied	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
harness	1
trimmed	1
with	1
rings	1
and	1
tassels	1
when	1
the	1
coachman	1
Ignat	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
luggage	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
village	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
contractor	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
that	1
Pava	1
had	1
calved	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
the	1
confusion	1
was	1
clearing	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
self	1
dissatisfaction	1
were	1
passing	1
away	1
He	1
felt	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
Ignat	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
sheepskin	1
brought	1
for	1
him	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sledge	1
and	1
had	1
driven	1
off	1
pondering	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
horse	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
saddle	1
horse	1
past	1
his	1
prime	1
now	1
but	1
a	1
spirited	1
beast	1
from	1
the	1
Don	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
light	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
anyone	1
else	1
All	1
he	1
wanted	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
before	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
resolved	1
that	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
hoping	1
for	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
happiness	1
such	1
as	1
marriage	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
so	1
disdain	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
Secondly	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
let	1
himself	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
low	1
passion	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
tortured	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
Then	1
remembering	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
forget	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
not	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
when	1
things	1
should	1
go	1
ill	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
he	1
felt	1
Then	1
too	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
talk	1
of	1
communism	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
treated	1
so	1
lightly	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
now	1
made	1
him	1
think	1
He	1
considered	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
economic	1
conditions	1
nonsense	1
But	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
abundance	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
determined	1
that	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
feel	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
worked	1
hard	1
and	1
lived	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
luxuriously	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
now	1
work	1
still	1
harder	1
and	1
would	1
allow	1
himself	1
even	1
less	1
luxury	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
easy	1
a	1
conquest	1
over	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
drive	1
in	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
daydreams	1
With	1
a	1
resolute	1
feeling	1
of	1
hope	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
better	1
life	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
before	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
at	1
night	1
The	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
quadrangle	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
windows	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
nurse	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
who	1
performed	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
housekeeper	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
asleep	1
Kouzma	1
waked	1
up	1
by	1
her	1
came	1
sidling	1
sleepily	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
A	1
setter	1
bitch	1
Laska	1
ran	1
out	1
too	1
almost	1
upsetting	1
Kouzma	1
and	1
whining	1
turned	1
round	1
about	1
Levin	1
s	1
knees	1
jumping	1
up	1
and	1
longing	1
but	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
forepaws	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
You	1
re	1
soon	1
back	1
again	1
sir	1
said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
I	1
got	1
tired	1
of	1
it	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
With	1
friends	1
one	1
is	1
well	1
but	1
at	1
home	1
one	1
is	1
better	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
The	1
study	1
was	1
slowly	1
lit	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
candle	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
The	1
familiar	1
details	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
stag	1
s	1
horns	1
the	1
bookshelves	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
the	1
stove	1
with	1
its	1
ventilator	1
which	1
had	1
long	1
wanted	1
mending	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
sofa	1
a	1
large	1
table	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
an	1
open	1
book	1
a	1
broken	1
ashtray	1
a	1
manuscript	1
book	1
with	1
his	1
handwriting	1
As	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
there	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
arranging	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
All	1
these	1
traces	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
seemed	1
to	1
clutch	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
No	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
different	1
but	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
you	1
ve	1
always	1
been	1
with	1
doubts	1
everlasting	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
yourself	1
vain	1
efforts	1
to	1
amend	1
and	1
falls	1
and	1
everlasting	1
expectation	1
of	1
a	1
happiness	1
which	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
get	1
and	1
which	1
isn	1
t	1
possible	1
for	1
you	1
This	1
the	1
things	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
another	1
voice	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
sway	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
oneself	1
And	1
hearing	1
that	1
voice	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
corner	1
where	1
stood	1
his	1
two	1
heavy	1
dumbbells	1
and	1
began	1
brandishing	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
gymnast	1
trying	1
to	1
restore	1
his	1
confident	1
temper	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
creak	1
of	1
steps	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
He	1
hastily	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
dumbbells	1
The	1
bailiff	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
said	1
everything	1
thank	1
God	1
was	1
doing	1
well	1
but	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
drying	1
machine	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
scorched	1
This	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
irritated	1
Levin	1
The	1
new	1
drying	1
machine	1
had	1
been	1
constructed	1
and	1
partly	1
invented	1
by	1
Levin	1
The	1
bailiff	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
against	1
the	1
drying	1
machine	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
suppressed	1
triumph	1
that	1
he	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
had	1
been	1
scorched	1
Levin	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
had	1
been	1
scorched	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
precautions	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1
given	1
orders	1
He	1
was	1
annoyed	1
and	1
reprimanded	1
the	1
bailiff	1
But	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
important	1
and	1
joyful	1
event	1
Pava	1
his	1
best	1
cow	1
an	1
expensive	1
beast	1
bought	1
at	1
a	1
show	1
had	1
calved	1
Kouzma	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
sheepskin	1
And	1
you	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
lantern	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
bailiff	1
The	1
cowhouse	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
valuable	1
cows	1
was	1
just	1
behind	1
the	1
house	1
Walking	1
across	1
the	1
yard	1
passing	1
a	1
snowdrift	1
by	1
the	1
lilac	1
tree	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
cowhouse	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
warm	1
steamy	1
smell	1
of	1
dung	1
when	1
the	1
frozen	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
cows	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lantern	1
stirred	1
on	1
the	1
fresh	1
straw	1
He	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
smooth	1
black	1
and	1
piebald	1
back	1
of	1
Hollandka	1
Berkoot	1
the	1
bull	1
was	1
lying	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
ring	1
in	1
his	1
lip	1
and	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
but	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
only	1
gave	1
two	1
snorts	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
by	1
him	1
Pava	1
a	1
perfect	1
beauty	1
huge	1
as	1
a	1
hippopotamus	1
with	1
her	1
back	1
turned	1
to	1
them	1
prevented	1
their	1
seeing	1
the	1
calf	1
as	1
she	1
sniffed	1
her	1
all	1
over	1
Levin	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
pen	1
looked	1
Pava	1
over	1
and	1
lifted	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
spotted	1
calf	1
onto	1
her	1
long	1
tottering	1
legs	1
Pava	1
uneasy	1
began	1
lowing	1
but	1
when	1
Levin	1
put	1
the	1
calf	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
soothed	1
and	1
sighing	1
heavily	1
began	1
licking	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
rough	1
tongue	1
The	1
calf	1
fumbling	1
poked	1
her	1
nose	1
under	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
udder	1
and	1
stiffened	1
her	1
tail	1
out	1
straight	1
Here	1
bring	1
the	1
light	1
Fyodor	1
this	1
way	1
said	1
Levin	1
examining	1
the	1
calf	1
Like	1
the	1
mother	1
though	1
the	1
color	1
takes	1
after	1
the	1
father	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
nothing	1
Very	1
good	1
Long	1
and	1
broad	1
in	1
the	1
haunch	1
Vassily	1
Fedorovitch	1
isn	1
t	1
she	1
splendid	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
bailiff	1
quite	1
forgiving	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
buckwheat	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
calf	1
How	1
could	1
she	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
Oh	1
Semyon	1
the	1
contractor	1
came	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
you	1
left	1
You	1
must	1
settle	1
with	1
him	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
said	1
the	1
bailiff	1
I	1
did	1
inform	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
machine	1
This	1
question	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
take	1
Levin	1
back	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
and	1
complicated	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
cowhouse	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
bailiff	1
and	1
Semyon	1
the	1
contractor	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
straight	1
upstairs	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
Chapter	1
27	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
big	1
and	1
old	1
fashioned	1
and	1
Levin	1
though	1
he	1
lived	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
heated	1
and	1
used	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
stupid	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
positively	1
not	1
right	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
new	1
plans	1
but	1
this	1
house	1
was	1
a	1
whole	1
world	1
to	1
Levin	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
had	1
lived	1
and	1
died	1
They	1
had	1
lived	1
just	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
to	1
Levin	1
seemed	1
the	1
ideal	1
of	1
perfection	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dreamed	1
of	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
his	1
family	1
Levin	1
scarcely	1
remembered	1
his	1
mother	1
His	1
conception	1
of	1
her	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
sacred	1
memory	1
and	1
his	1
future	1
wife	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
that	1
exquisite	1
holy	1
ideal	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
been	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
conceiving	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
woman	1
apart	1
from	1
marriage	1
that	1
he	1
positively	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
first	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
only	1
secondarily	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
family	1
His	1
ideas	1
of	1
marriage	1
were	1
consequently	1
quite	1
unlike	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
for	1
whom	1
getting	1
married	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
facts	1
of	1
social	1
life	1
For	1
Levin	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
affair	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
which	1
its	1
whole	1
happiness	1
turned	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
that	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
tea	1
and	1
had	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
tea	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
Well	1
I	1
ll	1
stay	1
a	1
while	1
sir	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
however	1
strange	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
parted	1
from	1
his	1
daydreams	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
them	1
Whether	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
with	1
another	1
still	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
He	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
and	1
stopping	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
who	1
gossiped	1
away	1
without	1
flagging	1
and	1
yet	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
pictures	1
of	1
family	1
life	1
and	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
rose	1
disconnectedly	1
before	1
his	1
imagination	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
something	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
settled	1
down	1
and	1
laid	1
to	1
rest	1
He	1
heard	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
talking	1
of	1
how	1
Prohor	1
had	1
forgotten	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
money	1
Levin	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
horse	1
had	1
been	1
drinking	1
without	1
stopping	1
and	1
had	1
beaten	1
his	1
wife	1
till	1
he	1
d	1
half	1
killed	1
her	1
He	1
listened	1
and	1
read	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
recalled	1
the	1
whole	1
train	1
of	1
ideas	1
suggested	1
by	1
his	1
reading	1
It	1
was	1
Tyndall	1
s	1
Treatise	1
on	1
Heat	1
He	1
recalled	1
his	1
own	1
criticisms	1
of	1
Tyndall	1
of	1
his	1
complacent	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
cleverness	1
of	1
his	1
experiments	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
philosophic	1
insight	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
floated	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
joyful	1
thought	1
In	1
two	1
years	1
time	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
two	1
Dutch	1
cows	1
Pava	1
herself	1
will	1
perhaps	1
still	1
be	1
alive	1
a	1
dozen	1
young	1
daughters	1
of	1
Berkoot	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
others	1
how	1
lovely	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
book	1
again	1
Very	1
good	1
electricity	1
and	1
heat	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
but	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
substitute	1
the	1
one	1
quantity	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
equation	1
for	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
any	1
problem	1
No	1
Well	1
then	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
The	1
connection	1
between	1
all	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
is	1
felt	1
instinctively	1
It	1
s	1
particulary	1
nice	1
if	1
Pava	1
s	1
daughter	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
red	1
spotted	1
cow	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
herd	1
will	1
take	1
after	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
three	1
too	1
Splendid	1
To	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
visitors	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
herd	1
My	1
wife	1
says	1
Kostya	1
and	1
I	1
looked	1
after	1
that	1
calf	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
interest	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
says	1
a	1
visitor	1
Everything	1
that	1
interests	1
him	1
interests	1
me	1
But	1
who	1
will	1
she	1
be	1
And	1
he	1
remembered	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
at	1
Moscow	1
Well	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
But	1
now	1
everything	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
way	1
It	1
s	1
nonsense	1
to	1
pretend	1
that	1
life	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
one	1
that	1
the	1
past	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
one	1
One	1
must	1
struggle	1
to	1
live	1
better	1
much	1
better	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
dreaming	1
Old	1
Laska	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
fully	1
digested	1
her	1
delight	1
at	1
his	1
return	1
and	1
had	1
run	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
bark	1
came	1
back	1
wagging	1
her	1
tail	1
and	1
crept	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
fresh	1
air	1
put	1
her	1
head	1
under	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
whined	1
plaintively	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
stroked	1
There	1
who	1
d	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
The	1
dog	1
now	1
why	1
she	1
understands	1
that	1
her	1
master	1
s	1
come	1
home	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
low	1
spirited	1
Why	1
low	1
spirited	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
it	1
sir	1
It	1
s	1
high	1
time	1
I	1
should	1
know	1
the	1
gentry	1
Why	1
I	1
ve	1
grown	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
thing	1
with	1
them	1
It	1
s	1
nothing	1
sir	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
s	1
health	1
and	1
a	1
clear	1
conscience	1
Levin	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
surprised	1
at	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
knew	1
his	1
thought	1
Shall	1
I	1
fetch	1
you	1
another	1
cup	1
said	1
she	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
cup	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
Laska	1
kept	1
poking	1
her	1
head	1
under	1
his	1
hand	1
He	1
stroked	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
promptly	1
curled	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
laying	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
a	1
hindpaw	1
And	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
all	1
now	1
being	1
well	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
a	1
little	1
smacked	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
settling	1
her	1
sticky	1
lips	1
more	1
comfortably	1
about	1
her	1
old	1
teeth	1
she	1
sank	1
into	1
blissful	1
repose	1
Levin	1
watched	1
all	1
her	1
movements	1
attentively	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1

Nothing	1

All	1

After	1
the	1
ball	1
early	1
next	1
morning	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
sent	1
her	1
husband	1
a	1
telegram	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
No	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
she	1
explained	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
plans	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
suggested	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
remember	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
enumerating	1
them	1
no	1
it	1
had	1
really	1
better	1
be	1
today	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
not	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
but	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
sister	1
off	1
at	1
seven	1
o	1
clock	1
Kitty	1
too	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
sending	1
a	1
note	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
Dolly	1
and	1
Anna	1
dined	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
fickle	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
acute	1
senses	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
now	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
abruptly	1
dropped	1
their	1
play	1
with	1
their	1
aunt	1
and	1
their	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
quite	1
indifferent	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
Anna	1
was	1
absorbed	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
in	1
preparations	1
for	1
her	1
departure	1
She	1
wrote	1
notes	1
to	1
her	1
Moscow	1
acquaintances	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
accounts	1
and	1
packed	1
Altogether	1
Dolly	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
placid	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
worried	1
mood	1
which	1
Dolly	1
knew	1
well	1
with	1
herself	1
and	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
without	1
cause	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
covers	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
self	1
After	1
dinner	1
Anna	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
Dolly	1
followed	1
her	1
How	1
queer	1
you	1
are	1
today	1
Dolly	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
queer	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
nasty	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
that	1
sometimes	1
I	1
keep	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
cry	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
stupid	1
but	1
it	1
ll	1
pass	1
off	1
said	1
Anna	1
quickly	1
and	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
over	1
a	1
tiny	1
bag	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
packing	1
a	1
nightcap	1
and	1
some	1
cambric	1
handkerchiefs	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
particularly	1
bright	1
and	1
were	1
continually	1
swimming	1
with	1
tears	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
leave	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
here	1
You	1
came	1
here	1
and	1
did	1
a	1
good	1
deed	1
said	1
Dolly	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
Anna	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
eyes	1
wet	1
with	1
tears	1
Don	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
Dolly	1
I	1
ve	1
done	1
nothing	1
and	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
I	1
often	1
wonder	1
why	1
people	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
league	1
to	1
spoil	1
me	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
and	1
what	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
In	1
your	1
heart	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
love	1
enough	1
to	1
forgive	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
you	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
How	1
happy	1
you	1
are	1
Anna	1
said	1
Dolly	1
Everything	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
good	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
Every	1
heart	1
has	1
its	1
own	1
skeletons	1
as	1
the	1
English	1
say	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
skeleton	1
have	1
you	1
Everything	1
is	1
so	1
clear	1
in	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
Anna	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
after	1
her	1
tears	1
a	1
sly	1
ironical	1
smile	1
curved	1
her	1
lips	1
Come	1
he	1
s	1
amusing	1
anyway	1
your	1
skeleton	1
and	1
not	1
depressing	1
said	1
Dolly	1
smiling	1
No	1
he	1
s	1
depressing	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
today	1
instead	1
of	1
tomorrow	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
confession	1
that	1
weighs	1
on	1
me	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
Anna	1
letting	1
herself	1
drop	1
definitely	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
Dolly	1
s	1
face	1
And	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
Dolly	1
saw	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
blushing	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
ears	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
curly	1
black	1
ringlets	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
Yes	1
Anna	1
went	1
on	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
Kitty	1
didn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
She	1
s	1
jealous	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
spoiled	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
ball	1
being	1
a	1
torture	1
to	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure	1
But	1
truly	1
truly	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
or	1
only	1
my	1
fault	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
she	1
said	1
daintily	1
drawling	1
the	1
words	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
Oh	1
how	1
like	1
Stiva	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
said	1
Dolly	1
laughing	1
Anna	1
was	1
hurt	1
Oh	1
no	1
oh	1
no	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
Stiva	1
she	1
said	1
knitting	1
her	1
brows	1
That	1
s	1
why	1
I	1
m	1
telling	1
you	1
just	1
because	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
let	1
myself	1
doubt	1
myself	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
said	1
Anna	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
uttering	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
true	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
doubting	1
herself	1
she	1
felt	1
emotion	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
sooner	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
simply	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
him	1
Yes	1
Stiva	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
danced	1
the	1
mazurka	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
how	1
absurdly	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
about	1
I	1
only	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
matchmaking	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
quite	1
differently	1
Possibly	1
against	1
my	1
own	1
will	1
She	1
crimsoned	1
and	1
stopped	1
Oh	1
they	1
feel	1
it	1
directly	1
said	1
Dolly	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
despair	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
anything	1
serious	1
in	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
Anna	1
interrupted	1
her	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
forgotten	1
and	1
Kitty	1
will	1
leave	1
off	1
hating	1
me	1
All	1
the	1
same	1
Anna	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
very	1
anxious	1
for	1
this	1
marriage	1
for	1
Kitty	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
nothing	1
if	1
he	1
Vronsky	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
day	1
Oh	1
heavens	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
silly	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
deep	1
flush	1
of	1
pleasure	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
absorbed	1
her	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
And	1
so	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
having	1
made	1
an	1
enemy	1
of	1
Kitty	1
whom	1
I	1
liked	1
so	1
much	1
Ah	1
how	1
sweet	1
she	1
is	1
But	1
you	1
ll	1
make	1
it	1
right	1
Dolly	1
Eh	1
Dolly	1
could	1
scarcely	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
She	1
loved	1
Anna	1
but	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
her	1
weaknesses	1
An	1
enemy	1
That	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
want	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
said	1
Anna	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
Ah	1
how	1
silly	1
I	1
am	1
today	1
She	1
passed	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
began	1
dressing	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
of	1
starting	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
arrived	1
late	1
rosy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
smelling	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
cigars	1
Anna	1
s	1
emotionalism	1
infected	1
Dolly	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
embraced	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
she	1
whispered	1
Remember	1
Anna	1
what	1
you	1
ve	1
done	1
for	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
And	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
shall	1
always	1
love	1
you	1
as	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
why	1
said	1
Anna	1
kissing	1
her	1
and	1
hiding	1
her	1
tears	1
You	1
understood	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
understand	1
Good	1
bye	1
my	1
darling	1
Chapter	1
29	1
Come	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
thank	1
God	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
blocking	1
up	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
till	1
the	1
third	1
bell	1
rang	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
lounge	1
beside	1
Annushka	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
carriage	1
Thank	1
God	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
all	1
nice	1
and	1
as	1
usual	1
Still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
anxious	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
Anna	1
took	1
pleasure	1
in	1
arranging	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
with	1
great	1
care	1
With	1
her	1
little	1
deft	1
hands	1
she	1
opened	1
and	1
shut	1
her	1
little	1
red	1
bag	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cushion	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
carefully	1
wrapping	1
up	1
her	1
feet	1
settled	1
herself	1
comfortably	1
An	1
invalid	1
lady	1
had	1
already	1
lain	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
Two	1
other	1
ladies	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
Anna	1
and	1
a	1
stout	1
elderly	1
lady	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
made	1
observations	1
about	1
the	1
heating	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
Anna	1
answered	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
but	1
not	1
foreseeing	1
any	1
entertainment	1
from	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
asked	1
Annushka	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lamp	1
hooked	1
it	1
onto	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
her	1
seat	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
her	1
bag	1
a	1
paper	1
knife	1
and	1
an	1
English	1
novel	1
At	1
first	1
her	1
reading	1
made	1
no	1
progress	1
The	1
fuss	1
and	1
bustle	1
were	1
disturbing	1
then	1
when	1
the	1
train	1
had	1
started	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
noises	1
then	1
the	1
snow	1
beating	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
window	1
and	1
sticking	1
to	1
the	1
pane	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
muffled	1
guard	1
passing	1
by	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
conversations	1
about	1
the	1
terrible	1
snowstorm	1
raging	1
outside	1
distracted	1
her	1
attention	1
Farther	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
continually	1
the	1
same	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
shaking	1
and	1
rattling	1
the	1
same	1
snow	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
the	1
same	1
rapid	1
transitions	1
from	1
steaming	1
heat	1
to	1
cold	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
heat	1
the	1
same	1
passing	1
glimpses	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
figures	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
voices	1
and	1
Anna	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
read	1
Annushka	1
was	1
already	1
dozing	1
the	1
red	1
bag	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
clutched	1
by	1
her	1
broad	1
hands	1
in	1
gloves	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
was	1
torn	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
read	1
and	1
understood	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
distasteful	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
read	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
lives	1
She	1
had	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
live	1
herself	1
If	1
she	1
read	1
that	1
the	1
heroine	1
of	1
the	1
novel	1
was	1
nursing	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
move	1
with	1
noiseless	1
steps	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
if	1
she	1
read	1
of	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
Parliament	1
making	1
a	1
speech	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
delivering	1
the	1
speech	1
if	1
she	1
read	1
of	1
how	1
Lady	1
Mary	1
had	1
ridden	1
after	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
had	1
provoked	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
had	1
surprised	1
everyone	1
by	1
her	1
boldness	1
she	1
too	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
the	1
same	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
and	1
twisting	1
the	1
smooth	1
paper	1
knife	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
hands	1
she	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
read	1
The	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
novel	1
was	1
already	1
almost	1
reaching	1
his	1
English	1
happiness	1
a	1
baronetcy	1
and	1
an	1
estate	1
and	1
Anna	1
was	1
feeling	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
estate	1
when	1
she	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
But	1
what	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
in	1
injured	1
surprise	1
She	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
sank	1
against	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
tightly	1
gripping	1
the	1
paper	1
cutter	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
She	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
her	1
Moscow	1
recollections	1
All	1
were	1
good	1
pleasant	1
She	1
remembered	1
the	1
ball	1
remembered	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
of	1
slavish	1
adoration	1
remembered	1
all	1
her	1
conduct	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
shameful	1
And	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
in	1
her	1
memories	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
was	1
intensified	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
her	1
Warm	1
very	1
warm	1
hot	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
resolutely	1
shifting	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
lounge	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
Am	1
I	1
afraid	1
to	1
look	1
it	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
this	1
officer	1
boy	1
there	1
exist	1
or	1
can	1
exist	1
any	1
other	1
relations	1
than	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
common	1
with	1
every	1
acquaintance	1
She	1
laughed	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
book	1
again	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
definitely	1
unable	1
to	1
follow	1
what	1
she	1
read	1
She	1
passed	1
the	1
paper	1
knife	1
over	1
the	1
window	1
pane	1
then	1
laid	1
its	1
smooth	1
cool	1
surface	1
to	1
her	1
cheek	1
and	1
almost	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
at	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
delight	1
that	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
cause	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
She	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
nerves	1
were	1
strings	1
being	1
strained	1
tighter	1
and	1
tighter	1
on	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
screwing	1
peg	1
She	1
felt	1
her	1
eyes	1
opening	1
wider	1
and	1
wider	1
her	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes	1
twitching	1
nervously	1
something	1
within	1
oppressing	1
her	1
breathing	1
while	1
all	1
shapes	1
and	1
sounds	1
seemed	1
in	1
the	1
uncertain	1
half	1
light	1
to	1
strike	1
her	1
with	1
unaccustomed	1
vividness	1
Moments	1
of	1
doubt	1
were	1
continually	1
coming	1
upon	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
the	1
train	1
were	1
going	1
forwards	1
or	1
backwards	1
or	1
were	1
standing	1
still	1
altogether	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
Annushka	1
at	1
her	1
side	1
or	1
a	1
stranger	1
What	1
s	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
a	1
fur	1
cloak	1
or	1
some	1
beast	1
And	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
myself	1
Myself	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
woman	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
this	1
delirium	1
But	1
something	1
drew	1
her	1
towards	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
yield	1
to	1
it	1
or	1
resist	1
it	1
at	1
will	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
rouse	1
herself	1
and	1
slipped	1
off	1
her	1
plaid	1
and	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
her	1
warm	1
dress	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
regained	1
her	1
self	1
possession	1
and	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
thin	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
wearing	1
a	1
long	1
overcoat	1
with	1
buttons	1
missing	1
from	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
stoveheater	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
thermometer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
snow	1
bursting	1
in	1
after	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
then	1
everything	1
grew	1
blurred	1
again	1
That	1
peasant	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
waist	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
gnawing	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
began	1
stretching	1
her	1
legs	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
filling	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
cloud	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fearful	1
shrieking	1
and	1
banging	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
were	1
being	1
torn	1
to	1
pieces	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
blinding	1
dazzle	1
of	1
red	1
fire	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
wall	1
seemed	1
to	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
hide	1
everything	1
Anna	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
sinking	1
down	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
terrible	1
but	1
delightful	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
muffled	1
up	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
shouted	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
ear	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
pulled	1
herself	1
together	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
a	1
station	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
guard	1
She	1
asked	1
Annushka	1
to	1
hand	1
her	1
the	1
cape	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
and	1
her	1
shawl	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
and	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
asked	1
Annushka	1
Yes	1
I	1
want	1
a	1
little	1
air	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
hot	1
in	1
here	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
The	1
driving	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
rushed	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
and	1
struggled	1
with	1
her	1
over	1
the	1
door	1
But	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
struggle	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
The	1
wind	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
gleeful	1
whistle	1
it	1
tried	1
to	1
snatch	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
bear	1
her	1
off	1
but	1
she	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
skirt	1
got	1
down	1
onto	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
The	1
wind	1
had	1
been	1
powerful	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
under	1
the	1
lee	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lull	1
With	1
enjoyment	1
she	1
drew	1
deep	1
breaths	1
of	1
the	1
frozen	1
snowy	1
air	1
and	1
standing	1
near	1
the	1
carriage	1
looked	1
about	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
the	1
lighted	1
station	1
Chapter	1
30	1
The	1
raging	1
tempest	1
rushed	1
whistling	1
between	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
about	1
the	1
scaffolding	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
station	1
The	1
carriages	1
posts	1
people	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
was	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
thickly	1
covered	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
there	1
would	1
come	1
a	1
lull	1
in	1
the	1
storm	1
but	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
swoop	1
down	1
again	1
with	1
such	1
onslaughts	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
it	1
Meanwhile	1
men	1
ran	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
talking	1
merrily	1
together	1
their	1
steps	1
crackling	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
as	1
they	1
continually	1
opened	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
big	1
doors	1
The	1
bent	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
glided	1
by	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
she	1
heard	1
sounds	1
of	1
a	1
hammer	1
upon	1
iron	1
Hand	1
over	1
that	1
telegram	1
came	1
an	1
angry	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stormy	1
darkness	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
This	1
way	1
No	1
28	1
several	1
different	1
voices	1
shouted	1
again	1
and	1
muffled	1
figures	1
ran	1
by	1
covered	1
with	1
snow	1
Two	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
lighted	1
cigarettes	1
passed	1
by	1
her	1
She	1
drew	1
one	1
more	1
deep	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
when	1
another	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
quite	1
close	1
beside	1
her	1
stepped	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
flickering	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
post	1
She	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
recognized	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
Putting	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
peak	1
of	1
his	1
cap	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
asked	1
Was	1
there	1
anything	1
she	1
wanted	1
Could	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
gazed	1
rather	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
answering	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
she	1
saw	1
or	1
fancied	1
she	1
saw	1
both	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
It	1
was	1
again	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
reverential	1
ecstasy	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
worked	1
upon	1
her	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
herself	1
during	1
the	1
past	1
few	1
days	1
and	1
again	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
before	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hundreds	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
forever	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
are	1
met	1
everywhere	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
herself	1
to	1
bestow	1
a	1
thought	1
upon	1
him	1
But	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joyful	1
pride	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
She	1
knew	1
as	1
certainly	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
letting	1
fall	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
grasped	1
the	1
door	1
post	1
And	1
irrepressible	1
delight	1
and	1
eagerness	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
coming	1
for	1
he	1
repeated	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
wind	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
surmounting	1
all	1
obstacles	1
sent	1
the	1
snow	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
roofs	1
and	1
clanked	1
some	1
sheet	1
of	1
iron	1
it	1
had	1
torn	1
off	1
while	1
the	1
hoarse	1
whistle	1
of	1
the	1
engine	1
roared	1
in	1
front	1
plaintively	1
and	1
gloomily	1
All	1
the	1
awfulness	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
more	1
splendid	1
now	1
He	1
had	1
said	1
what	1
her	1
soul	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
though	1
she	1
feared	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
reason	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
he	1
saw	1
conflict	1
Forgive	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
dislike	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
he	1
said	1
humbly	1
He	1
had	1
spoken	1
courteously	1
deferentially	1
yet	1
so	1
firmly	1
so	1
stubbornly	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
no	1
answer	1
It	1
s	1
wrong	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
you	1
ve	1
said	1
as	1
I	1
forget	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
Not	1
one	1
word	1
not	1
one	1
gesture	1
of	1
yours	1
shall	1
I	1
could	1
I	1
ever	1
forget	1
Enough	1
enough	1
she	1
cried	1
trying	1
assiduously	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
stern	1
expression	1
to	1
her	1
face	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
gazing	1
greedily	1
And	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
cold	1
door	1
post	1
she	1
clambered	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
got	1
rapidly	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
corridor	1
she	1
paused	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
Though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
her	1
own	1
words	1
or	1
his	1
she	1
realized	1
instinctively	1
that	1
the	1
momentary	1
conversation	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
fearfully	1
closer	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
panic	1
stricken	1
and	1
blissful	1
at	1
it	1
After	1
standing	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
The	1
overstrained	1
condition	1
which	1
had	1
tormented	1
her	1
before	1
did	1
not	1
only	1
come	1
back	1
but	1
was	1
intensified	1
and	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
every	1
minute	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
snap	1
within	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
excessive	1
tension	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
all	1
night	1
But	1
in	1
that	1
nervous	1
tension	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
that	1
filled	1
her	1
imagination	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
disagreeable	1
or	1
gloomy	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
blissful	1
glowing	1
and	1
exhilarating	1
Towards	1
morning	1
Anna	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
doze	1
sitting	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
waked	1
it	1
was	1
daylight	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
near	1
Petersburg	1
At	1
once	1
thoughts	1
of	1
home	1
of	1
husband	1
and	1
of	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
At	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
train	1
stopped	1
and	1
she	1
got	1
out	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
that	1
attracted	1
her	1
attention	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
Oh	1
mercy	1
why	1
do	1
his	1
ears	1
look	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
frigid	1
and	1
imposing	1
figure	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
ears	1
that	1
struck	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
as	1
propping	1
up	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
his	1
round	1
hat	1
Catching	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
his	1
lips	1
falling	1
into	1
their	1
habitual	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
tired	1
eyes	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
her	1
An	1
unpleasant	1
sensation	1
gripped	1
at	1
her	1
heart	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
his	1
obstinate	1
and	1
weary	1
glance	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
different	1
She	1
was	1
especially	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
experienced	1
on	1
meeting	1
him	1
That	1
feeling	1
was	1
an	1
intimate	1
familiar	1
feeling	1
like	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
which	1
she	1
experienced	1
in	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
But	1
hitherto	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
clearly	1
and	1
painfully	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
Yes	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
your	1
tender	1
spouse	1
as	1
devoted	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
after	1
marriage	1
burned	1
with	1

he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
deliberate	1
high	1
pitched	1
voice	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
tone	1
which	1
he	1
almost	1
always	1
took	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
jeering	1
at	1
anyone	1
who	1
should	1
say	1
in	1
earnest	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
Is	1
Seryozha	1
quite	1
well	1
she	1
asked	1
And	1
is	1
this	1
all	1
the	1
reward	1
said	1
he	1
for	1
my	1
ardor	1
He	1

Chapter	1
31	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
tried	1
to	1
sleep	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
He	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
or	1
scanning	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
got	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
indeed	1
on	1
previous	1
occasions	1
struck	1
and	1
impressed	1
people	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
air	1
of	1
unhesitating	1
composure	1
he	1
seemed	1
now	1
more	1
haughty	1
and	1
self	1
possessed	1
than	1
ever	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
people	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
things	1
A	1
nervous	1
young	1
man	1
a	1
clerk	1
in	1
a	1
law	1
court	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him	1
hated	1
him	1
for	1
that	1
look	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
pushed	1
against	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
but	1
a	1
person	1
But	1
Vronsky	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
under	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
this	1
refusal	1
to	1
recognize	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
person	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
nothing	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
Anna	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
believe	1
that	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
gave	1
him	1
happiness	1
and	1
pride	1
What	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
forces	1
hitherto	1
dissipated	1
wasted	1
were	1
centered	1
on	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
bent	1
with	1
fearful	1
energy	1
on	1
one	1
blissful	1
goal	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
at	1
it	1
He	1
knew	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
only	1
meaning	1
in	1
life	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
lay	1
in	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing	1
her	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
at	1
Bologova	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
seltzer	1
water	1
and	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Anna	1
involuntarily	1
his	1
first	1
word	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
now	1
and	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
all	1
night	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
kept	1
unceasingly	1
going	1
over	1
every	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
every	1
word	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
fancy	1
making	1
his	1
heart	1
faint	1
with	1
emotion	1
floated	1
pictures	1
of	1
a	1
possible	1
future	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
felt	1
after	1
his	1
sleepless	1
night	1
as	1
keen	1
and	1
fresh	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
cold	1
bath	1
He	1
paused	1
near	1
his	1
compartment	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
smiling	1
unconsciously	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
walk	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
will	1
say	1
something	1
turn	1
her	1
head	1
glance	1
smile	1
maybe	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
husband	1
whom	1
the	1
station	1
master	1
was	1
deferentially	1
escorting	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
Ah	1
yes	1
The	1
husband	1
Only	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
did	1
Vronsky	1
realize	1
clearly	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
attached	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
husband	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
husband	1
but	1
had	1
hardly	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
only	1
now	1
fully	1
believed	1
in	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
and	1
his	1
legs	1
clad	1
in	1
black	1
trousers	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
this	1
husband	1
calmly	1
take	1
her	1
arm	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
property	1
Seeing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
his	1
Petersburg	1
face	1
and	1
severely	1
self	1
confident	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
round	1
hat	1
with	1
his	1
rather	1
prominent	1
spine	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
sensation	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
feel	1
tortured	1
by	1
thirst	1
who	1
on	1
reaching	1
a	1
spring	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
dog	1
a	1
sheep	1
or	1
a	1
pig	1
who	1
has	1
drunk	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
muddied	1
the	1
water	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
swing	1
of	1
the	1
hips	1
and	1
flat	1
feet	1
particularly	1
annoyed	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
could	1
recognize	1
in	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself	1
an	1
indubitable	1
right	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
affected	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
physically	1
reviving	1
him	1
stirring	1
him	1
and	1
filling	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
rapture	1
He	1
told	1
his	1
German	1
valet	1
who	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
things	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
first	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
noted	1
with	1
a	1
lover	1
s	1
insight	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
slight	1
reserve	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
No	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
cannot	1
love	1
him	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
himself	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
approaching	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
he	1
noticed	1
too	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
near	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
Have	1
you	1
passed	1
a	1
good	1
night	1
he	1
asked	1
bowing	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
together	1
and	1
leaving	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
bow	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account	1
and	1
to	1
recognize	1
it	1
or	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
fit	1
Thank	1
you	1
very	1
good	1
she	1
answered	1
Her	1
face	1
looked	1
weary	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
play	1
of	1
eagerness	1
in	1
it	1
peeping	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
as	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
flash	1
died	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
for	1
that	1
moment	1
She	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
Vronsky	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
displeasure	1
vaguely	1
recalling	1
who	1
this	1
was	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
composure	1
and	1
self	1
confidence	1
here	1
struck	1
like	1
a	1
scythe	1
against	1
a	1
stone	1
upon	1
the	1
cold	1
self	1
confidence	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
Anna	1
Ah	1
We	1
are	1
acquainted	1
I	1
believe	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
indifferently	1
giving	1
his	1
hand	1
You	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
you	1
return	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
he	1
said	1
articulating	1
each	1
syllable	1
as	1
though	1
each	1
were	1
a	1
separate	1
favor	1
he	1
was	1
bestowing	1
You	1
re	1
back	1
from	1
leave	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
his	1
jesting	1
tone	1
Well	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
tears	1
shed	1
at	1
Moscow	1
at	1
parting	1
By	1
addressing	1
his	1
wife	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
gave	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
and	1
turning	1
slightly	1
towards	1
him	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
hat	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
turned	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
calling	1
on	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
glanced	1
with	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
Delighted	1
he	1
said	1
coldly	1
On	1
Mondays	1
we	1
re	1
at	1
home	1
Most	1
fortunate	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
dismissing	1
Vronsky	1
altogether	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
just	1
have	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
jesting	1
tone	1
You	1
lay	1
too	1
much	1
stress	1
on	1
your	1
devotion	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
value	1
it	1
much	1
she	1
responded	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
jesting	1
tone	1
involuntarily	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
steps	1
behind	1
them	1
But	1
what	1
has	1
it	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
asking	1
her	1
husband	1
how	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
got	1
on	1
without	1
her	1
Oh	1
capitally	1
Mariette	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
good	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
disappoint	1
you	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
missed	1
you	1
as	1
your	1
husband	1
has	1
But	1
once	1
more	1
merci	1
	1
my	1
dear	1
for	1
giving	1
me	1
a	1
day	1
Our	1
dear	1
Samovar	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
well	1
known	1
in	1
society	1
a	1
samovar	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
bubbling	1
over	1
with	1
excitement	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
continually	1
asking	1
after	1
you	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
venture	1
to	1
advise	1
you	1
you	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
today	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
takes	1
everything	1
to	1
heart	1
Just	1
now	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
cares	1
she	1
s	1
anxious	1
about	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
being	1
brought	1
together	1
The	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
and	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
coteries	1
of	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
world	1
with	1
which	1
Anna	1
was	1
through	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
relations	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
Still	1
she	1
ll	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
details	1
Go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
too	1
tired	1
my	1
dear	1
Well	1
Kondraty	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
committee	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
alone	1
at	1
dinner	1
again	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
on	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
tone	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
I	1
ve	1
missed	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
pressure	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
meaning	1
smile	1
he	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
carriage	1
Chapter	1
32	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
to	1
meet	1
Anna	1
at	1
home	1
was	1
her	1
son	1
He	1
dashed	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
governess	1
s	1
call	1
and	1
with	1
desperate	1
joy	1
shrieked	1
Mother	1
mother	1
Running	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
hung	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
mother	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
governess	1
I	1
knew	1
And	1
her	1
son	1
like	1
her	1
husband	1
aroused	1
in	1
Anna	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
disappointment	1
She	1
had	1
imagined	1
him	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
She	1
had	1
to	1
let	1
herself	1
drop	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
reality	1
to	1
enjoy	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
But	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
charming	1
with	1
his	1
fair	1
curls	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
plump	1
graceful	1
little	1
legs	1
in	1
tightly	1
pulled	1
up	1
stockings	1
Anna	1
experienced	1
almost	1
physical	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
his	1
nearness	1
and	1
his	1
caresses	1
and	1
moral	1
soothing	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
his	1
simple	1
confiding	1
and	1
loving	1
glance	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
na"ive	1
questions	1
Anna	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
presents	1
Dolly	1
s	1
children	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
son	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
little	1
girl	1
was	1
Tanya	1
at	1
Moscow	1
and	1
how	1
Tanya	1
could	1
read	1
and	1
even	1
taught	1
the	1
other	1
children	1
Why	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
so	1
nice	1
as	1
she	1
asked	1
Seryozha	1
To	1
me	1
you	1
re	1
nicer	1
than	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
said	1
Seryozha	1
smiling	1
Anna	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
drink	1
her	1
coffee	1
when	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
announced	1
The	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
stout	1
woman	1
with	1
an	1
unhealthily	1
sallow	1
face	1
and	1
splendid	1
pensive	1
black	1
eyes	1
Anna	1
liked	1
her	1
but	1
today	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
seeing	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
defects	1
Well	1
my	1
dear	1
so	1
you	1
took	1
the	1
olive	1
branch	1
inquired	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
much	1
less	1
serious	1
than	1
we	1
had	1
supposed	1
answered	1
Anna	1
My	1
belle	1
soeur	1
is	1
in	1
general	1
too	1
hasty	1
But	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
everything	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
concern	1
her	1
had	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
never	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
interested	1
her	1
she	1
interrupted	1
Anna	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
plenty	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
worried	1
today	1
Oh	1
why	1
asked	1
Anna	1
trying	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
I	1
m	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
weary	1
of	1
fruitlessly	1
championing	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
sometimes	1
I	1
m	1
quite	1
unhinged	1
by	1
it	1
The	1
Society	1
of	1
the	1
Little	1
Sisters	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
religiously	1
patriotic	1
philanthropic	1
institution	1
was	1
going	1
splendidly	1
but	1
with	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
added	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
ironical	1
submission	1
to	1
destiny	1
They	1
pounce	1
on	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
distort	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
work	1
it	1
out	1
so	1
pettily	1
and	1
unworthily	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
people	1
your	1
husband	1
among	1
them	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
simply	1
drag	1
it	1
down	1
Yesterday	1
Pravdin	1
wrote	1
to	1
me	1
Pravdin	1
was	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
Panslavist	1
abroad	1
and	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
described	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
Then	1
the	1
countess	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
more	1
disagreements	1
and	1
intrigues	1
against	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
unification	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
and	1
departed	1
in	1
haste	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
some	1
society	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
committee	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
before	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
notice	1
it	1
before	1
Anna	1
asked	1
herself	1
Or	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
very	1
much	1
irritated	1
today	1
It	1
s	1
really	1
ludicrous	1
her	1
object	1
is	1
doing	1
good	1
she	1
a	1
Christian	1
yet	1
she	1
s	1
always	1
angry	1
and	1
she	1
always	1
has	1
enemies	1
and	1
always	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christianity	1
and	1
doing	1
good	1
After	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
another	1
friend	1
came	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
chief	1
secretary	1
who	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
At	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
she	1
too	1
went	1
away	1
promising	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
ministry	1
Anna	1
left	1
alone	1
spent	1
the	1
time	1
till	1
dinner	1
in	1
assisting	1
at	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
dinner	1
he	1
dined	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
parents	1
and	1
in	1
putting	1
her	1
things	1
in	1
order	1
and	1
in	1
reading	1
and	1
answering	1
the	1
notes	1
and	1
letters	1
which	1
had	1
accumulated	1
on	1
her	1
table	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
causeless	1
shame	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
journey	1
and	1
her	1
excitement	1
too	1
had	1
completely	1
vanished	1
In	1
the	1
habitual	1
conditions	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
she	1
felt	1
again	1
resolute	1
and	1
irreproachable	1
She	1
recalled	1
with	1
wonder	1
her	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
Nothing	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
something	1
silly	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
and	1
I	1
answered	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
attach	1
importance	1
to	1
what	1
has	1
no	1
importance	1
She	1
remembered	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
husband	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
declaration	1
made	1
her	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
subordinates	1
and	1
how	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
answered	1
that	1
every	1
woman	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
exposed	1
to	1
such	1
incidents	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
fullest	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
tact	1
and	1
could	1
never	1
lower	1
her	1
and	1
himself	1
by	1
jealousy	1
So	1
then	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
indeed	1
thank	1
God	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
Chapter	1
33	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
at	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
but	1
as	1
often	1
happened	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
people	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
petitions	1
and	1
to	1
sign	1
some	1
papers	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
chief	1
secretary	1
At	1
dinner	1
time	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
a	1
few	1
people	1
dining	1
with	1
the	1
Karenins	1
there	1
arrived	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
a	1
cousin	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
department	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
Anna	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
receive	1
these	1
guests	1
Precisely	1
at	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
before	1
the	1
bronze	1
Peter	1
the	1
First	1
clock	1
had	1
struck	1
the	1
fifth	1
stroke	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
came	1
in	1
wearing	1
a	1
white	1
tie	1
and	1
evening	1
coat	1
with	1
two	1
stars	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
directly	1
after	1
dinner	1
Every	1
minute	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
life	1
was	1
portioned	1
out	1
and	1
occupied	1
And	1
to	1
make	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
all	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
adhered	1
to	1
the	1
strictest	1
punctuality	1
Unhasting	1
and	1
unresting	1
was	1
his	1
motto	1
He	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
hall	1
greeted	1
everyone	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
sat	1
down	1
smiling	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
Yes	1
my	1
solitude	1
is	1
over	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
uncomfortable	1
he	1
laid	1
stress	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
uncomfortable	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
dine	1
alone	1
At	1
dinner	1
he	1
talked	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
about	1
Moscow	1
matters	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
asked	1
her	1
after	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
but	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
general	1
dealing	1
with	1
Petersburg	1
official	1
and	1
public	1
news	1
After	1
dinner	1
he	1
spent	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
with	1
his	1
guests	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
pressed	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
withdrew	1
and	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
council	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
that	1
evening	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
Tverskaya	1
who	1
hearing	1
of	1
her	1
return	1
had	1
invited	1
her	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
theater	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
box	1
for	1
that	1
evening	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
principally	1
because	1
the	1
dress	1
she	1
had	1
reckoned	1
upon	1
was	1
not	1
ready	1
Altogether	1
Anna	1
on	1
turning	1
after	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
her	1
guests	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
her	1
attire	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
annoyed	1
She	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
dressing	1
well	1
without	1
great	1
expense	1
and	1
before	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
dressmaker	1
three	1
dresses	1
to	1
transform	1
The	1
dresses	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
altered	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
recognized	1
and	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ready	1
three	1
days	1
before	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
two	1
dresses	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
at	1
all	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
altered	1
as	1
Anna	1
had	1
intended	1
The	1
dressmaker	1
came	1
to	1
explain	1
declaring	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
and	1
Anna	1
was	1
so	1
furious	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
when	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
afterwards	1
To	1
regain	1
her	1
serenity	1
completely	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
herself	1
signed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
tucked	1
him	1
up	1
She	1
was	1
glad	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
out	1
anywhere	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
so	1
well	1
She	1
felt	1
so	1
light	1
hearted	1
and	1
serene	1
she	1
saw	1
so	1
clearly	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
important	1
on	1
her	1
railway	1
journey	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
trivial	1
incidents	1
of	1
fashionable	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
before	1
anyone	1
else	1
or	1
before	1
herself	1
Anna	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
hearth	1
with	1
an	1
English	1
novel	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
Exactly	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
nine	1
she	1
heard	1
his	1
ring	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Here	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
observed	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
Altogether	1
then	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
visit	1
was	1
a	1
success	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Oh	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
about	1
everything	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
her	1
journey	1
with	1
Countess	1
Vronskaya	1
her	1
arrival	1
the	1
accident	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
Then	1
she	1
described	1
the	1
pity	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
first	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
afterwards	1
for	1
Dolly	1
I	1
imagine	1
one	1
cannot	1
exonerate	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
blame	1
though	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
brother	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
severely	1
Anna	1
smiled	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
simply	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
family	1
considerations	1
could	1
not	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
expressing	1
his	1
genuine	1
opinion	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
characteristic	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
liked	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
it	1
has	1
all	1
ended	1
so	1
satisfactorily	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
back	1
again	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
Come	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
new	1
act	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
council	1
Anna	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
act	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
conscience	1
stricken	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
able	1
so	1
readily	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
Here	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
it	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
sensation	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
complacent	1
smile	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
something	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
questions	1
to	1
telling	1
it	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
complacent	1
smile	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
ovations	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
act	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
It	1
shows	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
reasonable	1
and	1
steady	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
becoming	1
prevalent	1
among	1
us	1
Having	1
drunk	1
his	1
second	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
with	1
cream	1
and	1
bread	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
towards	1
his	1
study	1
And	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
anywhere	1
this	1
evening	1
You	1
ve	1
been	1
dull	1
I	1
expect	1
he	1
said	1
Oh	1
no	1
she	1
answered	1
getting	1
up	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
accompanying	1
him	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
reading	1
now	1
she	1
asked	1

A	1
very	1

book	1
Anna	1
smiled	1
as	1
people	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
weaknesses	1
of	1
those	1
they	1
love	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
hand	1
under	1
his	1
she	1
escorted	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
She	1
knew	1
his	1
habit	1
that	1
had	1
grown	1
into	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
reading	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
She	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
official	1
duties	1
which	1
swallowed	1
up	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
everything	1
of	1
note	1
that	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
intellectual	1
world	1
She	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
interested	1
in	1
books	1
dealing	1
with	1
politics	1
philosophy	1
and	1
theology	1
that	1
art	1
was	1
utterly	1
foreign	1
to	1
his	1
nature	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
rather	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
never	1
passed	1
over	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
art	1
but	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
read	1
everything	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
politics	1
in	1
philosophy	1
in	1
theology	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
often	1
had	1
doubts	1
and	1
made	1
investigations	1
but	1
on	1
questions	1
of	1
art	1
and	1
poetry	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
of	1
music	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
totally	1
devoid	1
of	1
understanding	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
most	1
distinct	1
and	1
decided	1
opinions	1
He	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
Shakespeare	1
Raphael	1
Beethoven	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
new	1
schools	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
music	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
classified	1
by	1
him	1
with	1
very	1
conspicuous	1
consistency	1
Well	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
where	1
a	1
shaded	1
candle	1
and	1
a	1
decanter	1
of	1
water	1
were	1
already	1
put	1
by	1
his	1
armchair	1
And	1
I	1
ll	1
write	1
to	1
Moscow	1
He	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
again	1
kissed	1
it	1
All	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
truthful	1
good	1
hearted	1
and	1
remarkable	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
line	1
Anna	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
defending	1
him	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
had	1
attacked	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
But	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
his	1
ears	1
stick	1
out	1
so	1
strangely	1
Or	1
has	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
hair	1
cut	1
Precisely	1
at	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
Anna	1
was	1
still	1
sitting	1
at	1
her	1
writing	1
table	1
finishing	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Dolly	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
measured	1
steps	1
in	1
slippers	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
freshly	1
washed	1
and	1
combed	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
It	1
s	1
time	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
meaning	1
smile	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
their	1
bedroom	1
And	1
what	1
right	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
like	1
that	1
thought	1
Anna	1
recalling	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
glance	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Undressing	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
eagerness	1
which	1
during	1
her	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
had	1
fairly	1
flashed	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
smile	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
now	1
the	1
fire	1
seemed	1
quenched	1
in	1
her	1
hidden	1
somewhere	1
far	1
away	1
Chapter	1
34	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
large	1
set	1
of	1
rooms	1
in	1
Morskaia	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
favorite	1
comrade	1
Petritsky	1
Petritsky	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
lieutenant	1
not	1
particularly	1
well	1
connected	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
not	1
wealthy	1
but	1
always	1
hopelessly	1
in	1
debt	1
Towards	1
evening	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
drunk	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
locked	1
up	1
after	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
ludicrous	1
and	1
disgraceful	1
scandals	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
favorite	1
both	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
his	1
superior	1
officers	1
On	1
arriving	1
at	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
from	1
the	1
station	1
at	1
his	1
flat	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
outer	1
door	1
a	1
hired	1
carriage	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
While	1
still	1
outside	1
his	1
own	1
door	1
as	1
he	1
rang	1
he	1
heard	1
masculine	1
laughter	1
the	1
lisp	1
of	1
a	1
feminine	1
voice	1
and	1
Petritsky	1
s	1
voice	1
If	1
that	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
villains	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
him	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
told	1
the	1
servant	1
not	1
to	1
announce	1
him	1
and	1
slipped	1
quietly	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
room	1
Baroness	1
Shilton	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
Petritsky	1
s	1
with	1
a	1
rosy	1
little	1
face	1
and	1
flaxen	1
hair	1
resplendent	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
satin	1
gown	1
and	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
like	1
a	1
canary	1
with	1
her	1
Parisian	1
chatter	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
round	1
table	1
making	1
coffee	1
Petritsky	1
in	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
the	1
cavalry	1
captain	1
Kamerovsky	1
in	1
full	1
uniform	1
probably	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
duty	1

sitting	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
Bravo	1
Vronsky	1
shouted	1
Petritsky	1

up	1
scraping	1
his	1
chair	1
Our	1

some	1
coffee	1
for	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

Why	1

Hope	1
you	1

satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
your	1
study	1
he	1
said	1
indicating	1
the	1
baroness	1
You	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
so	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
smile	1
pressing	1
the	1
baroness	1
s	1
little	1
hand	1
What	1
next	1
I	1
m	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
You	1

after	1
a	1
journey	1

the	1
baroness	1
so	1
I	1
m	1
flying	1
Oh	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
off	1
this	1
minute	1
if	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
You	1
re	1
home	1
wherever	1
you	1
are	1
baroness	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
Kamerovsky	1
he	1
added	1
coldly	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
Kamerovsky	1
There	1
you	1
never	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
such	1
pretty	1
things	1
said	1
the	1
baroness	1
turning	1
to	1
Petritsky	1
No	1
what	1
s	1
that	1
for	1
After	1
dinner	1
I	1
say	1
things	1
quite	1
as	1
good	1
After	1
dinner	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
credit	1
in	1
them	1
Well	1
then	1
I	1
ll	1
make	1
you	1
some	1
coffee	1
so	1
go	1
and	1
wash	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
said	1
the	1
baroness	1
sitting	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
anxiously	1
turning	1
the	1
screw	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
coffee	1
pot	1
Pierre	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
coffee	1
she	1
said	1
addressing	1
Petritsky	1
whom	1
she	1
called	1
Pierre	1
as	1
a	1
contraction	1
of	1
his	1
surname	1
making	1
no	1
secret	1
of	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
ll	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
You	1
ll	1
spoil	1
it	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
spoil	1
it	1
Well	1
and	1
your	1
wife	1
said	1
the	1
baroness	1
suddenly	1
interrupting	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
comrade	1
We	1
ve	1
been	1
marrying	1
you	1
here	1
Have	1
you	1
brought	1
your	1
wife	1
No	1
baroness	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
a	1
Bohemian	1
and	1
a	1
Bohemian	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
Shake	1
hands	1
on	1
it	1
And	1
the	1
baroness	1
detaining	1
Vronsky	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
with	1
many	1
jokes	1
about	1
her	1
last	1
new	1
plans	1
of	1
life	1
asking	1
his	1
advice	1
He	1
persists	1
in	1
refusing	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
divorce	1
Well	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
He	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
Now	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
suit	1
against	1
him	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
advise	1
Kamerovsky	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
coffee	1
it	1
s	1
boiling	1
over	1
You	1
see	1
I	1
m	1
engrossed	1
with	1
business	1
I	1
want	1
a	1
lawsuit	1
because	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
my	1
property	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
unfaithful	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
contemptuously	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
my	1
fortune	1
Vronsky	1
heard	1
with	1
pleasure	1
this	1
light	1
hearted	1
prattle	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
agreed	1
with	1
her	1
gave	1
her	1
half	1
joking	1
counsel	1
and	1
altogether	1
dropped	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
tone	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
such	1
women	1
In	1
his	1
Petersburg	1
world	1
all	1
people	1
were	1
divided	1
into	1
utterly	1
opposed	1
classes	1
One	1
the	1
lower	1
class	1
vulgar	1
stupid	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
ridiculous	1
people	1
who	1
believe	1
that	1
one	1
husband	1
ought	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
wife	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
lawfully	1
married	1
that	1
a	1
girl	1
should	1
be	1
innocent	1
a	1
woman	1
modest	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
manly	1
self	1
controlled	1
and	1
strong	1
that	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
one	1
s	1
children	1
earn	1
one	1
s	1
bread	1
and	1
pay	1
one	1
s	1
debts	1
and	1
various	1
similar	1
absurdities	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
old	1
fashioned	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
people	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
class	1
of	1
people	1
the	1
real	1
people	1
To	1
this	1
class	1
they	1
all	1
belonged	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
elegant	1
generous	1
plucky	1
gay	1
to	1
abandon	1
oneself	1
without	1
a	1
blush	1
to	1
every	1
passion	1
and	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
everything	1
else	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
only	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
startled	1
after	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
world	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Moscow	1
But	1
immediately	1
as	1
though	1
slipping	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
old	1
slippers	1
he	1
dropped	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
hearted	1
pleasant	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
lived	1
in	1
The	1
coffee	1
was	1
never	1
really	1
made	1
but	1
spluttered	1
over	1
everyone	1
and	1
boiled	1
away	1
doing	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
providing	1
much	1
cause	1
for	1
much	1
noise	1
and	1
laughter	1
and	1
spoiling	1
a	1
costly	1
rug	1
and	1
the	1
baroness	1
s	1
gown	1
Well	1
now	1
good	1
bye	1
or	1
you	1
ll	1
never	1
get	1
washed	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
on	1
my	1
conscience	1
the	1
worst	1
sin	1
a	1
gentleman	1
can	1
commit	1
So	1
you	1
would	1
advise	1
a	1
knife	1
to	1
his	1
throat	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
manage	1
that	1
your	1
hand	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1
He	1
ll	1
kiss	1
your	1
hand	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
end	1
satisfactorily	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
So	1
at	1
the	1
Francais	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
skirts	1
she	1
vanished	1
Kamerovsky	1
got	1
up	1
too	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
shook	1
hands	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
dressing	1
room	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
washing	1
Petritsky	1
described	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
brief	1
outlines	1
his	1
position	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
No	1
money	1
at	1
all	1
His	1
father	1
said	1
he	1
wouldn	1
t	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
and	1
pay	1
his	1
debts	1
His	1
tailor	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
locked	1
up	1
and	1
another	1
fellow	1
too	1
was	1
threatening	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
locked	1
up	1
The	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
announced	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
scandals	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
leave	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
baroness	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
to	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
especially	1
since	1
she	1
d	1
taken	1
to	1
offering	1
continually	1
to	1
lend	1
him	1
money	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
girl	1
he	1
d	1
show	1
her	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
a	1
marvel	1
exquisite	1
in	1
the	1
strict	1
Oriental	1
style	1
genre	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1
Rebecca	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
He	1
d	1
had	1
a	1
row	1
too	1
with	1
Berkoshov	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
send	1
seconds	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
nothing	1
Altogether	1
everything	1
was	1
supremely	1
amusing	1
and	1
jolly	1
And	1
not	1
letting	1
his	1
comrade	1
enter	1
into	1
further	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
Petritsky	1
proceeded	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
interesting	1
news	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Petritsky	1
s	1
familiar	1
stories	1
in	1
the	1
familiar	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
rooms	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
years	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
a	1
delightful	1
sense	1
of	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
careless	1
Petersburg	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
Impossible	1
he	1
cried	1
letting	1
down	1
the	1
pedal	1
of	1
the	1
washing	1
basin	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sousing	1
his	1
healthy	1
red	1
neck	1
Impossible	1
he	1
cried	1
at	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
Laura	1
had	1
flung	1
over	1
Fertinghof	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
Mileev	1
And	1
is	1
he	1
as	1
stupid	1
and	1
pleased	1
as	1
ever	1
Well	1
and	1
how	1
s	1
Buzulukov	1
Oh	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
tale	1
about	1
Buzulukov	1
simply	1
lovely	1
cried	1
Petritsky	1
You	1
know	1
his	1
weakness	1
for	1
balls	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
misses	1
a	1
single	1
court	1
ball	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
big	1
ball	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
helmet	1
Have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
new	1
helmets	1
Very	1
nice	1
lighter	1
Well	1
so	1
he	1
s	1
standing	1
No	1
I	1
say	1
do	1
listen	1
I	1
am	1
listening	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
rubbing	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
rough	1
towel	1
Up	1
comes	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duchess	1
with	1
some	1
ambassador	1
or	1
other	1
and	1
as	1
ill	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
she	1
begins	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
new	1
helmets	1
The	1
Grand	1
Duchess	1
positively	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
new	1
helmet	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador	1
They	1
see	1
our	1
friend	1
standing	1
there	1
Petritsky	1
mimicked	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
the	1
helmet	1
The	1
Grand	1
Duchess	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
helmet	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
Well	1
everyone	1
s	1
winking	1
at	1
him	1
nodding	1
frowning	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
do	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
s	1
mute	1
as	1
a	1
fish	1
Only	1
picture	1
it	1
Well	1
the	1
what	1
s	1
his	1
name	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
tries	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
helmet	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
He	1
pulls	1
it	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
hands	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duchess	1
Here	1
your	1
Highness	1
says	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
helmet	1
She	1
turned	1
the	1
helmet	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
up	1
And	1
just	1
picture	1
it	1
plop	1
went	1
a	1
pear	1
and	1
sweetmeats	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
two	1
pounds	1
of	1
sweetmeats	1
He	1
d	1
been	1
storing	1
them	1
up	1
the	1
darling	1
Vronsky	1
burst	1
into	1
roars	1
of	1
laughter	1
And	1
long	1
afterwards	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
broke	1
out	1
into	1
his	1
healthy	1
laugh	1
showing	1
his	1
strong	1
close	1
rows	1
of	1
teeth	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
helmet	1
Having	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
valet	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
uniform	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
report	1
himself	1
He	1
intended	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
and	1
to	1
Betsy	1
s	1
and	1
to	1
pay	1
several	1
visits	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
beginning	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
that	1
society	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
As	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
left	1
home	1
not	1
meaning	1
to	1
return	1
till	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
PART	1
TWO	1
Chapter	1
1	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
a	1
consultation	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
pronounce	1
on	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
health	1
and	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
restore	1
her	1
failing	1
strength	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
ill	1
and	1
as	1
spring	1
came	1
on	1
she	1
grew	1
worse	1
The	1
family	1
doctor	1
gave	1
her	1
cod	1
liver	1
oil	1
then	1
iron	1
then	1
nitrate	1
of	1
silver	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
were	1
alike	1
in	1
doing	1
no	1
good	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
advice	1
when	1
spring	1
came	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
a	1
celebrated	1
physician	1
was	1
called	1
in	1
The	1
celebrated	1
physician	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
man	1
still	1
youngish	1
asked	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
patient	1
He	1
maintained	1
with	1
peculiar	1
satisfaction	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
maiden	1
modesty	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
relic	1
of	1
barbarism	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
still	1
youngish	1
to	1
handle	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
naked	1
He	1
thought	1
it	1
natural	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
felt	1
and	1
thought	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
no	1
harm	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
considered	1
modesty	1
in	1
the	1
girl	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
relic	1
of	1
barbarism	1
but	1
also	1
as	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
himself	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
submit	1
since	1
although	1
all	1
the	1
doctors	1
had	1
studied	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
school	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
books	1
and	1
learned	1
the	1
same	1
science	1
and	1
though	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
this	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
household	1
and	1
circle	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
accepted	1
that	1
this	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
alone	1
had	1
some	1
special	1
knowledge	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
save	1
Kitty	1
After	1
a	1
careful	1
examination	1
and	1
sounding	1
of	1
the	1
bewildered	1
patient	1
dazed	1
with	1
shame	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
having	1
scrupulously	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
The	1
prince	1
frowned	1
and	1
coughed	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
As	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
something	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
neither	1
a	1
fool	1
nor	1
an	1
invalid	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
medicine	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
furious	1
at	1
the	1
whole	1
farce	1
specially	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
perhaps	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
fully	1
comprehended	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
Conceited	1
blockhead	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
s	1
chatter	1
about	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
symptoms	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
meantime	1
with	1
difficulty	1
restraining	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
this	1
old	1
gentleman	1
and	1
with	1
difficulty	1
condescending	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence	1
He	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
principal	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
mother	1
Before	1
her	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
scatter	1
his	1
pearls	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
The	1
prince	1
withdrew	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
ridiculous	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
whole	1
performance	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
distracted	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
She	1
felt	1
she	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
Kitty	1
Well	1
doctor	1
decide	1
our	1
fate	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Tell	1
me	1
everything	1
Is	1
there	1
hope	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
her	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
the	1
question	1
Well	1
doctor	1
Immediately	1
princess	1
I	1
will	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
my	1
colleague	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
laying	1
my	1
opinion	1
before	1
you	1
So	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
you	1
As	1
you	1
please	1
The	1
princess	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
When	1
the	1
doctors	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
began	1
timidly	1
explaining	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
commencement	1
of	1
tuberculous	1
trouble	1
but	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
The	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
sentence	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
big	1
gold	1
watch	1
Yes	1
said	1
he	1
But	1
The	1
family	1
doctor	1
respectfully	1
ceased	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
observations	1
The	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
tuberculous	1
process	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
able	1
to	1
define	1
till	1
there	1
are	1
cavities	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
definite	1
But	1
we	1
may	1
suspect	1
it	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
indications	1
malnutrition	1
nervous	1
excitability	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
The	1
question	1
stands	1
thus	1
in	1
presence	1
of	1
indications	1
of	1
tuberculous	1
process	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
maintain	1
nutrition	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
moral	1
spiritual	1
causes	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
in	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
permitted	1
himself	1
to	1
interpolate	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
an	1
understood	1
thing	1
responded	1
the	1
celebrated	1
physician	1
again	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
Beg	1
pardon	1
is	1
the	1
Yausky	1
bridge	1
done	1
yet	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
drive	1
around	1
he	1
asked	1
Ah	1
it	1
is	1
Oh	1
well	1
then	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
So	1
we	1
were	1
saying	1
the	1
problem	1
may	1
be	1
put	1
thus	1
to	1
maintain	1
nutrition	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
tone	1
to	1
the	1
nerves	1
The	1
one	1
is	1
in	1
close	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
must	1
attack	1
both	1
sides	1
at	1
once	1
And	1
how	1
about	1
a	1
tour	1
abroad	1
asked	1
the	1
family	1
doctor	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
liking	1
for	1
foreign	1
tours	1
And	1
take	1
note	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
early	1
stage	1
of	1
tuberculous	1
process	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
certain	1
a	1
foreign	1
tour	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
What	1
is	1
wanted	1
is	1
means	1
of	1
improving	1
nutrition	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
lowering	1
it	1
And	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
expounded	1
his	1
plan	1
of	1
treatment	1
with	1
Soden	1
waters	1
a	1
remedy	1
obviously	1
prescribed	1
primarily	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
harm	1
The	1
family	1
doctor	1
listened	1
attentively	1
and	1
respectfully	1
But	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
foreign	1
travel	1
I	1
would	1
urge	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
habits	1
the	1
removal	1
from	1
conditions	1
calling	1
up	1
reminiscences	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
mother	1
wishes	1
it	1
he	1
added	1
Ah	1
Well	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
Only	1
those	1
German	1
quacks	1
are	1
mischievous	1
They	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
Well	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
then	1
He	1
glanced	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
Oh	1
time	1
s	1
up	1
already	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
The	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
announced	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
from	1
him	1
dictated	1
his	1
doing	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
patient	1
once	1
more	1
What	1
another	1
examination	1
cried	1
the	1
mother	1
with	1
horror	1
Oh	1
no	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
details	1
princess	1
Come	1
this	1
way	1
And	1
the	1
mother	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
doctor	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Wasted	1
and	1
flushed	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
glitter	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
left	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
shame	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
through	1
Kitty	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
When	1
the	1
doctor	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
All	1
her	1
illness	1
and	1
treatment	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
stupid	1
ludicrous	1
even	1
Doctoring	1
her	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
absurd	1
as	1
putting	1
together	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
vase	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
broken	1
Why	1
would	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
cure	1
her	1
with	1
pills	1
and	1
powders	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
grieve	1
her	1
mother	1
especially	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
considered	1
herself	1
to	1
blame	1
May	1
I	1
trouble	1
you	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
princess	1
the	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
facing	1
her	1
felt	1
her	1
pulse	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
asking	1
her	1
tiresome	1
questions	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
got	1
up	1
furious	1
Excuse	1
me	1
doctor	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
no	1
object	1
in	1
this	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
you	1
ve	1
asked	1
me	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
The	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
offense	1
Nervous	1
irritability	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
when	1
Kitty	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
However	1
I	1
had	1
finished	1
And	1
the	1
doctor	1
began	1
scientifically	1
explaining	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
an	1
exceptionally	1
intelligent	1
woman	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
princess	1
and	1
concluded	1
by	1
insisting	1
on	1
the	1
drinking	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
were	1
certainly	1
harmless	1
At	1
the	1
question	1
Should	1
they	1
go	1
abroad	1
the	1
doctor	1
plunged	1
into	1
deep	1
meditation	1
as	1
though	1
resolving	1
a	1
weighty	1
problem	1
Finally	1
his	1
decision	1
was	1
pronounced	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
but	1
to	1
put	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
foreign	1
quacks	1
and	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
need	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
piece	1
of	1
good	1
fortune	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
gone	1
The	1
mother	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
cheerful	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
Kitty	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
cheerful	1
She	1
had	1
often	1
almost	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
pretending	1
now	1
Really	1
I	1
m	1
quite	1
well	1
mamma	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
tour	1
she	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
Dolly	1
had	1
arrived	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
consultation	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
up	1
after	1
her	1
confinement	1
she	1
had	1
another	1
baby	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
born	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
trouble	1
and	1
anxiety	1
enough	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
tiny	1
baby	1
and	1
a	1
sick	1
child	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
hear	1
Kitty	1
s	1
fate	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
that	1
day	1
Well	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
You	1
re	1
all	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
Good	1
news	1
then	1
They	1
tried	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
talked	1
distinctly	1
enough	1
and	1
at	1
great	1
length	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
to	1
report	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
The	1
only	1
point	1
of	1
interest	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
abroad	1
Dolly	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
sighing	1
Her	1
dearest	1
friend	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
And	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
cheerful	1
one	1
Her	1
relations	1
with	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
after	1
their	1
reconciliation	1
had	1
become	1
humiliating	1
The	1
union	1
Anna	1
had	1
cemented	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
solid	1
character	1
and	1
family	1
harmony	1
was	1
breaking	1
down	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
nothing	1
definite	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
hardly	1
ever	1
at	1
home	1
money	1
too	1
was	1
hardly	1
ever	1
forthcoming	1
and	1
Dolly	1
was	1
continually	1
tortured	1
by	1
suspicions	1
of	1
infidelity	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
dismiss	1
dreading	1
the	1
agonies	1
of	1
jealousy	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
through	1
already	1
The	1
first	1
onslaught	1
of	1
jealousy	1
once	1
lived	1
through	1
could	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
infidelities	1
could	1
never	1
now	1
affect	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
Such	1
a	1
discovery	1
now	1
would	1
only	1
mean	1
breaking	1
up	1
family	1
habits	1
and	1
she	1
let	1
herself	1
be	1
deceived	1
despising	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
weakness	1
Besides	1
this	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
large	1
family	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
worry	1
to	1
her	1
first	1
the	1
nursing	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
baby	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
well	1
then	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
now	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
fallen	1
ill	1
Well	1
how	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
asked	1
her	1
mother	1
Ah	1
mamma	1
we	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
troubles	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
Lili	1
is	1
ill	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
it	1
s	1
scarlatina	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
here	1
now	1
to	1
hear	1
about	1
Kitty	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
shut	1
myself	1
up	1
entirely	1
if	1
God	1
forbid	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
scarlatina	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
too	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
his	1
study	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
departure	1
and	1
after	1
presenting	1
his	1
cheek	1
to	1
Dolly	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
settled	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
stay	1
here	1
Alexander	1
said	1
his	1
wife	1
That	1
s	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
Mamma	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
father	1
come	1
with	1
us	1
said	1
Kitty	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
nicer	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
us	1
too	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stroked	1
Kitty	1
s	1
hair	1
She	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
It	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
better	1
than	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much	1
about	1
her	1
Being	1
the	1
youngest	1
she	1
was	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
favorite	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
gave	1
him	1
insight	1
When	1
now	1
her	1
glance	1
met	1
his	1
blue	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
right	1
through	1
her	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
within	1
her	1
Reddening	1
she	1
stretched	1
out	1
towards	1
him	1
expecting	1
a	1
kiss	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
patted	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
said	1
These	1
stupid	1
chignons	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
getting	1
at	1
the	1
real	1
daughter	1
One	1
simply	1
strokes	1
the	1
bristles	1
of	1
dead	1
women	1
Well	1
Dolinka	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
elder	1
daughter	1
what	1
s	1
your	1
young	1
buck	1
about	1
hey	1
Nothing	1
father	1
answered	1
Dolly	1
understanding	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
meant	1
He	1
s	1
always	1
out	1
I	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
see	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
adding	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile	1
Why	1
hasn	1
t	1
he	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
yet	1
to	1
see	1
about	1
selling	1
that	1
forest	1
No	1
he	1
s	1
still	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
And	1
so	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
journey	1
too	1
At	1
your	1
service	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
sitting	1
down	1
And	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
Katia	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
younger	1
daughter	1
you	1
must	1
wake	1
up	1
one	1
fine	1
day	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
yourself	1
Why	1
I	1
m	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
merry	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
again	1
with	1
father	1
for	1
an	1
early	1
morning	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
frost	1
Hey	1
What	1
her	1
father	1
said	1
seemed	1
simple	1
enough	1
yet	1
at	1
these	1
words	1
Kitty	1
became	1
confused	1
and	1
overcome	1
like	1
a	1
detected	1
criminal	1
Yes	1
he	1
sees	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
understands	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
s	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
m	1
ashamed	1
I	1
must	1
get	1
over	1
my	1
shame	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
pluck	1
up	1
spirit	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
answer	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
begin	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
and	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
See	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
your	1
jokes	1
the	1
princess	1
pounced	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
You	1
re	1
always	1
she	1
began	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
reproaches	1
The	1
prince	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
scolding	1
rather	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
without	1
speaking	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frowning	1
She	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
poor	1
child	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
and	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
how	1
it	1
hurts	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
slightest	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
Ah	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
mistaken	1
in	1
people	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
tone	1
both	1
Dolly	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
why	1
there	1
aren	1
t	1
laws	1
against	1
such	1
base	1
dishonorable	1
people	1
Ah	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
gloomily	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
low	1
chair	1
and	1
seeming	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
yet	1
stopping	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
There	1
are	1
laws	1
madam	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
ve	1
challenged	1
me	1
to	1
it	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
who	1
s	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it	1
all	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
you	1
and	1
nobody	1
else	1
Laws	1
against	1
such	1
young	1
gallants	1
there	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
and	1
there	1
still	1
are	1
Yes	1
if	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
nothing	1
that	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
old	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
d	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
barrier	1
the	1
young	1
dandy	1
Yes	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
physic	1
her	1
and	1
call	1
in	1
these	1
quacks	1
The	1
prince	1
apparently	1
had	1
plenty	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
heard	1
his	1
tone	1
she	1
subsided	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
became	1
penitent	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
on	1
serious	1
occasions	1
Alexander	1
Alexander	1
she	1
whispered	1
moving	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
weep	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
the	1
prince	1
too	1
calmed	1
down	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
There	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1
You	1
re	1
wretched	1
too	1
I	1
know	1
It	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
great	1
harm	1
done	1
God	1
is	1
merciful	1
thanks	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
responded	1
to	1
the	1
tearful	1
kiss	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Before	1
this	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Kitty	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
tears	1
Dolly	1
with	1
her	1
motherly	1
family	1
instincts	1
had	1
promptly	1
perceived	1
that	1
here	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
work	1
lay	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
She	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
morally	1
speaking	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
and	1
prepared	1
for	1
action	1
While	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
attacking	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
mother	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
filial	1
reverence	1
would	1
allow	1
During	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
outburst	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
tender	1
towards	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
so	1
quickly	1
being	1
kind	1
again	1
But	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
left	1
them	1
she	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
needful	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Kitty	1
and	1
console	1
her	1
I	1
d	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
mamma	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Levin	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
Kitty	1
an	1
offer	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
He	1
told	1
Stiva	1
so	1
Well	1
what	1
then	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
So	1
did	1
Kitty	1
perhaps	1
refuse	1
him	1
She	1
didn	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
so	1
No	1
she	1
has	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
either	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
s	1
too	1
proud	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Yes	1
but	1
suppose	1
she	1
has	1
refused	1
Levin	1
and	1
she	1
wouldn	1
t	1
have	1
refused	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
know	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
deceived	1
her	1
so	1
horribly	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
terrible	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
she	1
broke	1
out	1
angrily	1
Oh	1
I	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
Nowadays	1
they	1
will	1
all	1
go	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
mothers	1
haven	1
t	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
anything	1
and	1
then	1
Mamma	1
I	1
ll	1

Chapter	1

When	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
Kitty	1
s	1
little	1
room	1
a	1
pretty	1
pink	1
little	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
knick	1
knacks	1
in	1
vieux	1
saxe	1
	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
pink	1
and	1
white	1
and	1
gay	1
as	1
Kitty	1
herself	1
had	1
been	1
two	1
months	1
ago	1
Dolly	1
remembered	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
decorated	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
year	1
before	1
together	1
with	1
what	1
love	1
and	1
gaiety	1
Her	1
heart	1
turned	1
cold	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Kitty	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
immovably	1
on	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
rug	1
Kitty	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
rather	1
ill	1
tempered	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
I	1
m	1
just	1
going	1
now	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
and	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
said	1
Dolly	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
What	1
about	1
Kitty	1
asked	1
swiftly	1
lifting	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
dismay	1
What	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
but	1
your	1
trouble	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
trouble	1
Nonsense	1
Kitty	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
could	1
help	1
knowing	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
believe	1
me	1
it	1
s	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
consequence	1
We	1
ve	1
all	1
been	1
through	1
it	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
had	1
a	1
stern	1
expression	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
worth	1
your	1
grieving	1
over	1
him	1
pursued	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
coming	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
No	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
treated	1
me	1
with	1
contempt	1
said	1
Kitty	1
in	1
a	1
breaking	1
voice	1
Don	1
t	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
But	1
who	1
can	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
so	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
if	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
Oh	1
the	1
most	1
awful	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
this	1
sympathizing	1
shrieked	1
Kitty	1
suddenly	1
flying	1
into	1
a	1
passion	1
She	1
turned	1
round	1
on	1
her	1
chair	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
rapidly	1
moving	1
her	1
fingers	1
pinched	1
the	1
clasp	1
of	1
her	1
belt	1
first	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
Dolly	1
knew	1
this	1
trick	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
of	1
clenching	1
her	1
hands	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
excited	1
she	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
in	1
moments	1
of	1
excitement	1
Kitty	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
forgetting	1
herself	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
Dolly	1
would	1
have	1
soothed	1
her	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
What	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
feel	1
eh	1
said	1
Kitty	1
quickly	1
That	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
a	1
straw	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
dying	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
sister	1
who	1
imagines	1
that	1
that	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
sympathizing	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
these	1
condolences	1
and	1
humbug	1
Kitty	1
you	1
re	1
unjust	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
tormenting	1
me	1
But	1
I	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
re	1
unhappy	1
But	1
Kitty	1
in	1
her	1
fury	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
I	1
ve	1
nothing	1
to	1
grieve	1
over	1
and	1
be	1
comforted	1
about	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
proud	1
ever	1
to	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
me	1
Yes	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
either	1
Only	1
one	1
thing	1
Tell	1
me	1
the	1
truth	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
tell	1
me	1
did	1
Levin	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
The	1
mention	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
name	1
seemed	1
to	1
deprive	1
Kitty	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
vestige	1
of	1
self	1
control	1
She	1
leaped	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
chair	1
and	1
flinging	1
her	1
clasp	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
she	1
gesticulated	1
rapidly	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
said	1
Why	1
bring	1
Levin	1
in	1
too	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
torment	1
me	1
for	1
I	1
ve	1
told	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
again	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
pride	1
and	1
never	1
never	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
doing	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
s	1
deceived	1
you	1
who	1
has	1
cared	1
for	1
another	1
woman	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
You	1
may	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
And	1
saying	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
Dolly	1
sat	1
silent	1
her	1
head	1
mournfully	1
bowed	1
Kitty	1
instead	1
of	1
running	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
sat	1
down	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
The	1
silence	1
lasted	1
for	1
two	1
minutes	1
Dolly	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself	1
That	1
humiliation	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
conscious	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
bitterness	1
when	1
her	1
sister	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
it	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
looked	1
for	1
such	1
cruelty	1
in	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
But	1
suddenly	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
skirt	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
heart	1
rending	1
smothered	1
sobbing	1
and	1
felt	1
arms	1
about	1
her	1
neck	1
Kitty	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
before	1
her	1
Dolinka	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
so	1
wretched	1
she	1
whispered	1
penitently	1
And	1
the	1
sweet	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
tears	1
hid	1
itself	1
in	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
skirt	1
As	1
though	1
tears	1
were	1
the	1
indispensable	1
oil	1
without	1
which	1
the	1
machinery	1
of	1
mutual	1
confidence	1
could	1
not	1
run	1
smoothly	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
the	1
sisters	1
after	1
their	1
tears	1
talked	1
not	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
uppermost	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
but	1
though	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
outside	1
matters	1
they	1
understood	1
each	1
other	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
in	1
anger	1
about	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
infidelity	1
and	1
her	1
humiliating	1
position	1
had	1
cut	1
her	1
poor	1
sister	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
forgiven	1
her	1
Dolly	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
knew	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
She	1
felt	1
certain	1
that	1
her	1
surmises	1
were	1
correct	1
that	1
Kitty	1
s	1
misery	1
her	1
inconsolable	1
misery	1
was	1
due	1
precisely	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Levin	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
him	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
deceived	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
fully	1
prepared	1
to	1
love	1
Levin	1
and	1
to	1
detest	1
Vronsky	1
Kitty	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
talked	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
miserable	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
calmer	1
but	1
can	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
everything	1
has	1
become	1
hateful	1
loathsome	1
coarse	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
what	1
loathsome	1
thoughts	1
I	1
have	1
about	1
everything	1
Why	1
whatever	1
loathsome	1
thoughts	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
smiling	1
The	1
most	1
utterly	1
loathsome	1
and	1
coarse	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
unhappiness	1
or	1
low	1
spirits	1
but	1
much	1
worse	1
As	1
though	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
me	1
was	1
all	1
hidden	1
away	1
and	1
nothing	1
was	1
left	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
loathsome	1
Come	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
puzzled	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
eyes	1
Father	1
began	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
me	1
just	1
now	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
thinks	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
Mother	1
takes	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
ball	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
only	1
takes	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
me	1
married	1
off	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
and	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
truth	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
drive	1
away	1
such	1
thoughts	1
Eligible	1
suitors	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
re	1
taking	1
stock	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
summing	1
me	1
up	1
In	1
old	1
days	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
in	1
a	1
ball	1
dress	1
was	1
a	1
simple	1
joy	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
admired	1
myself	1
now	1
I	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
and	1
awkward	1
And	1
then	1
The	1
doctor	1
Then	1
Kitty	1
hesitated	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
further	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
this	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
become	1
insufferably	1
repulsive	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
grossest	1
and	1
most	1
hideous	1
conceptions	1
rising	1
before	1
her	1
imagination	1
Oh	1
well	1
everything	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
coarsest	1
most	1
loathsome	1
light	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
That	1
s	1
my	1
illness	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
pass	1
off	1
But	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
I	1
m	1
never	1
happy	1
except	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
at	1
your	1
house	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
Oh	1
yes	1
I	1
m	1
coming	1
I	1
ve	1

scarlatina	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
persuade	1

to	1
let	1
me	1
Kitty	1
insisted	1
on	1
having	1
her	1
way	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1

and	1
nursed	1
the	1
children	1

The	1

The	1
highest	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
is	1
essentially	1
one	1
in	1
it	1
everyone	1
knows	1
everyone	1
else	1
everyone	1
even	1
visits	1
everyone	1
else	1
But	1
this	1
great	1
set	1
has	1
its	1
subdivisions	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
Karenina	1
had	1
friends	1
and	1
close	1
ties	1
in	1
three	1
different	1
circles	1
of	1
this	1
highest	1
society	1
One	1
circle	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
government	1
official	1
set	1
consisting	1
of	1
his	1
colleagues	1
and	1
subordinates	1
brought	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
various	1
and	1
capricious	1
manner	1
and	1
belonging	1
to	1
different	1
social	1
strata	1
Anna	1
found	1
it	1
difficult	1
now	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
almost	1
awe	1
stricken	1
reverence	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
entertained	1
for	1
these	1
persons	1
Now	1
she	1
knew	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
people	1
know	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
town	1
she	1
knew	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
weaknesses	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
shoe	1
pinched	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
She	1
knew	1
their	1
relations	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
authorities	1
knew	1
who	1
was	1
for	1
whom	1
and	1
how	1
each	1
one	1
maintained	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
agreed	1
and	1
disagreed	1
But	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
political	1
masculine	1
interests	1
had	1
never	1
interested	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
influence	1
and	1
she	1
avoided	1
it	1
Another	1
little	1
set	1
with	1
which	1
Anna	1
was	1
in	1
close	1
relations	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
career	1
The	1
center	1
of	1
this	1
circle	1
was	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
set	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
elderly	1
ugly	1
benevolent	1
and	1
godly	1
women	1
and	1
clever	1
learned	1
and	1
ambitious	1
men	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
clever	1
people	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
set	1
had	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
the	1
highest	1
esteem	1
for	1
this	1
circle	1
and	1
Anna	1
with	1
her	1
special	1
gift	1
for	1
getting	1
on	1
with	1
everyone	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
made	1
friends	1
in	1
this	1
circle	1
also	1
Now	1
since	1
her	1
return	1
from	1
Moscow	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
feel	1
this	1
set	1
insufferable	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
both	1
she	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
insincere	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
bored	1
and	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
that	1
world	1
that	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
The	1
third	1
circle	1
with	1
which	1
Anna	1
had	1
ties	1
was	1
preeminently	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
balls	1
of	1
dinners	1
of	1
sumptuous	1
dresses	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
hung	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
avoid	1
sinking	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
demi	1
monde	1
For	1
the	1
demi	1
monde	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
fashionable	1
world	1
believed	1
that	1
they	1
despised	1
though	1
their	1
tastes	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
similar	1
but	1
in	1
fact	1
identical	1
Her	1
connection	1
with	1
this	1
circle	1
was	1
kept	1
up	1
through	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
Tverskaya	1
her	1
cousin	1
s	1
wife	1
who	1
had	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
great	1
fancy	1
to	1
Anna	1
ever	1
since	1
she	1
first	1
came	1
out	1
showed	1
her	1
much	1
attention	1
and	1
drew	1
her	1
into	1
her	1
set	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
coterie	1
When	1
I	1
m	1
old	1
and	1
ugly	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
Betsy	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
pretty	1
young	1
woman	1
like	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
early	1
days	1
for	1
that	1
house	1
of	1
charity	1
Anna	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
avoided	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
world	1
because	1
it	1
necessitated	1
an	1
expenditure	1
beyond	1
her	1
means	1
and	1
besides	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
preferred	1
the	1
first	1
circle	1
But	1
since	1
her	1
visit	1
to	1
Moscow	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
She	1
avoided	1
her	1
serious	1
minded	1
friends	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world	1
There	1
she	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
experienced	1
an	1
agitating	1
joy	1
at	1
those	1
meetings	1
She	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
specially	1
often	1
at	1
Betsy	1
s	1
for	1
Betsy	1
was	1
a	1
Vronsky	1
by	1
birth	1
and	1
his	1
cousin	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
everywhere	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
meeting	1
Anna	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
encouragement	1
but	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
met	1
him	1
there	1
surged	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
that	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
quickened	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
railway	1
carriage	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
She	1
was	1
conscious	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
delight	1
sparkled	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
curved	1
her	1
lips	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
quench	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
this	1
delight	1
At	1
first	1
Anna	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
daring	1
to	1
pursue	1
her	1
Soon	1
after	1
her	1
return	1
from	1
Moscow	1
on	1
arriving	1
at	1
a	1
soir'ee	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
him	1
there	1
she	1
realized	1
distinctly	1
from	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
disappointment	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
deceiving	1
herself	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
pursuit	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
not	1
distasteful	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
The	1
celebrated	1
singer	1
was	1
singing	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
theater	1
Vronsky	1
seeing	1
his	1
cousin	1
from	1
his	1
stall	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
row	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
entr	1
acte	1
but	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
box	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
marvel	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
sight	1
of	1
lovers	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
she	1
wasn	1
t	1
there	1
But	1
come	1
after	1
the	1
opera	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
her	1
She	1
nodded	1
He	1
thanked	1
her	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
But	1
how	1
I	1
remember	1
your	1
jeers	1
continued	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
peculiar	1
pleasure	1
in	1
following	1
up	1
this	1
passion	1
to	1
a	1
successful	1
issue	1
What	1
s	1
become	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
You	1
re	1
caught	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
That	1
s	1
my	1
one	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
caught	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
his	1
serene	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
If	1
I	1
complain	1
of	1
anything	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
caught	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
lose	1
hope	1
Why	1
whatever	1
hope	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
said	1
Betsy	1
offended	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
Entendons	1
nous	1
	1
But	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
there	1
were	1
gleams	1
of	1
light	1
that	1
betrayed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
perfectly	1
and	1
precisely	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
hope	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
None	1
whatever	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
laughing	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
even	1
rows	1
of	1
teeth	1
Excuse	1
me	1
he	1
added	1
taking	1
an	1
opera	1
glass	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
proceeding	1
to	1
scrutinize	1
over	1
her	1
bare	1
shoulder	1
the	1
row	1
of	1
boxes	1
facing	1
them	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
I	1
m	1
becoming	1
ridiculous	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
ran	1
no	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
ridiculous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Betsy	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
fashionable	1
people	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
an	1
unsuccessful	1
lover	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
woman	1
free	1
to	1
marry	1
might	1
be	1
ridiculous	1
But	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
pursuing	1
a	1
married	1
woman	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
everything	1
staking	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
drawing	1
her	1
into	1
adultery	1
has	1
something	1
fine	1
and	1
grand	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
gay	1
smile	1
under	1
his	1
mustaches	1
that	1
he	1
lowered	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
But	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
she	1
said	1
admiring	1
him	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
busily	1
employed	1
and	1
doing	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
ll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
hundred	1
guesses	1
a	1
thousand	1
you	1
d	1
never	1
guess	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
reconciling	1
a	1
husband	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
d	1
insulted	1
his	1
wife	1
Yes	1
really	1
Well	1
did	1
you	1
succeed	1
Almost	1
You	1
really	1
must	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
Come	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
entr	1
acte	1
	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
From	1
Nilsson	1
Betsy	1
queried	1
in	1
horror	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
herself	1
have	1
distinguished	1
Nilsson	1
s	1
voice	1
from	1
any	1
chorus	1
girl	1
s	1
Can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
I	1
ve	1
an	1
appointment	1
there	1
all	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
my	1
mission	1
of	1
peace	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
peacemakers	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
said	1
Betsy	1
vaguely	1
recollecting	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
some	1
similar	1
saying	1
from	1
someone	1
Very	1
well	1
then	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
about	1
And	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
Chapter	1
5	1
This	1
is	1
rather	1
indiscreet	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
good	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
awful	1
temptation	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
story	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
mention	1
any	1
names	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
guess	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
Well	1
listen	1
two	1
festive	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
driving	1
Officers	1
of	1
your	1
regiment	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
they	1
were	1
officers	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
lunching	1
In	1
other	1
words	1
drinking	1
Possibly	1
They	1
were	1
driving	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
a	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
festive	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
And	1
they	1
beheld	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
she	1
overtakes	1
them	1
looks	1
round	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
fancy	1
anyway	1
nods	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
laughs	1
They	1
of	1
course	1
follow	1
her	1
They	1
gallop	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
To	1
their	1
amazement	1
the	1
fair	1
one	1
alights	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
house	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
The	1
fair	1
one	1
darts	1
upstairs	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
story	1
They	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
red	1
lips	1
under	1
a	1
short	1
veil	1
and	1
exquisite	1
little	1
feet	1
You	1
describe	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
fancy	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
And	1
after	1
what	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
Well	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
their	1
comrade	1
s	1
he	1
was	1
giving	1
a	1
farewell	1
dinner	1
There	1
they	1
certainly	1
did	1
drink	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
as	1
one	1
always	1
does	1
at	1
farewell	1
dinners	1
And	1
at	1
dinner	1
they	1
inquire	1
who	1
lives	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
only	1
their	1
host	1
s	1
valet	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
their	1
inquiry	1
whether	1
any	1
young	1
ladies	1
are	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
floor	1
answered	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
about	1
there	1
After	1
dinner	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
go	1
into	1
their	1
host	1
s	1
study	1
and	1
write	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
fair	1
one	1
They	1
compose	1
an	1
ardent	1
epistle	1
a	1
declaration	1
in	1
fact	1
and	1
they	1
carry	1
the	1
letter	1
upstairs	1
themselves	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
elucidate	1
whatever	1
might	1
appear	1
not	1
perfectly	1
intelligible	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
telling	1
me	1
these	1
horrible	1
stories	1
Well	1
They	1
ring	1
A	1
maid	1
servant	1
opens	1
the	1
door	1
they	1
hand	1
her	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
assure	1
the	1
maid	1
that	1
they	1
re	1
both	1
so	1
in	1
love	1
that	1
they	1
ll	1
die	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
The	1
maid	1
stupefied	1
carries	1
in	1
their	1
messages	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
gentleman	1
appears	1
with	1
whiskers	1
like	1
sausages	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
a	1
lobster	1
announces	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
flat	1
except	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sends	1
them	1
both	1
about	1
their	1
business	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
had	1
whiskers	1
like	1
sausages	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
Ah	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
I	1
ve	1
just	1
been	1
to	1
make	1
peace	1
between	1
them	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
then	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
happy	1
couple	1
a	1
government	1
clerk	1
and	1
his	1
lady	1
The	1
government	1
clerk	1
lodges	1
a	1
complaint	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
mediator	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
mediator	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
Talleyrand	1
couldn	1
t	1
hold	1
a	1
candle	1
to	1
me	1
Why	1
where	1
was	1
the	1
difficulty	1
Ah	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
We	1
apologize	1
in	1
due	1
form	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
despair	1
we	1
entreat	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
misunderstanding	1
The	1
government	1
clerk	1
with	1
the	1
sausages	1
begins	1
to	1
melt	1
but	1
he	1
too	1
desires	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
sentiments	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
express	1
them	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
get	1
hot	1
and	1
say	1
nasty	1
things	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
m	1
obliged	1
to	1
trot	1
out	1
all	1
my	1
diplomatic	1
talents	1
I	1
allowed	1
that	1
their	1
conduct	1
was	1
bad	1
but	1
I	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
into	1
consideration	1
their	1
heedlessness	1
their	1
youth	1
then	1
too	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
lunching	1
together	1
You	1
understand	1
They	1
regret	1
it	1
deeply	1
and	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
overlook	1
their	1
misbehavior	1
The	1
government	1
clerk	1
was	1
softened	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
consent	1
count	1
and	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
overlook	1
it	1
but	1
you	1
perceive	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
my	1
wife	1
s	1
a	1
respectable	1
woman	1
has	1
been	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
persecution	1
and	1
insults	1
and	1
effrontery	1
of	1
young	1
upstarts	1
scoundrels	1
And	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
the	1
young	1
upstarts	1
are	1
present	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
peace	1
between	1
them	1
Again	1
I	1
call	1
out	1
all	1
my	1
diplomacy	1
and	1
again	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
about	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
our	1
friend	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
gets	1
hot	1
and	1
red	1
and	1
his	1
sausages	1
stand	1
on	1
end	1
with	1
wrath	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
launch	1
out	1
into	1
diplomatic	1
wiles	1
Ah	1
he	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
story	1
said	1
Betsy	1
laughing	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
box	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
making	1
me	1
laugh	1
so	1
Well	1
bonne	1
chance	1
she	1
added	1
giving	1
Vronsky	1
one	1
finger	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shrug	1
of	1
her	1
shoulders	1
she	1
twitched	1
down	1
the	1
bodice	1
of	1
her	1
gown	1
that	1
had	1
worked	1
up	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
duly	1
naked	1
as	1
she	1
moved	1
forward	1
towards	1
the	1
footlights	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
gas	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
eyes	1
Vronsky	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
where	1
he	1
really	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
who	1
never	1
missed	1
a	1
single	1
performance	1
there	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
mediation	1
which	1
had	1
occupied	1
and	1
amused	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
days	1
Petritsky	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
was	1
implicated	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
culprit	1
was	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
and	1
first	1
rate	1
comrade	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
joined	1
the	1
regiment	1
the	1
young	1
Prince	1
Kedrov	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
important	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
were	1
involved	1
in	1
it	1
too	1
Both	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
company	1
The	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
waited	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
Venden	1
with	1
a	1
complaint	1
against	1
his	1
officers	1
who	1
had	1
insulted	1
his	1
wife	1
His	1
young	1
wife	1
so	1
Venden	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
was	1
at	1
church	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
suddenly	1
overcome	1
by	1
indisposition	1
arising	1
from	1
her	1
interesting	1
condition	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
remain	1
standing	1
she	1
drove	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
sledge	1
a	1
smart	1
looking	1
one	1
she	1
came	1
across	1
On	1
the	1
spot	1
the	1
officers	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
alarmed	1
and	1
feeling	1
still	1
more	1
unwell	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
staircase	1
home	1
Venden	1
himself	1
on	1
returning	1
from	1
his	1
office	1
heard	1
a	1
ring	1
at	1
their	1
bell	1
and	1
voices	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
intoxicated	1
officers	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
them	1
out	1
He	1
asked	1
for	1
exemplary	1
punishment	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
invited	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
Petritsky	1
s	1
becoming	1
impossible	1
Not	1
a	1
week	1
goes	1
by	1
without	1
some	1
scandal	1
This	1
government	1
clerk	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
he	1
ll	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
thing	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
thanklessness	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
of	1
a	1
duel	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
and	1
hush	1
the	1
matter	1
up	1
The	1
colonel	1
had	1
called	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honorable	1
and	1
intelligent	1
man	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
They	1
talked	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
decided	1
that	1
Petritsky	1
and	1
Kedrov	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
Venden	1
s	1
to	1
apologize	1
The	1
colonel	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
were	1
both	1
fully	1
aware	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
name	1
and	1
rank	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
contribute	1
greatly	1
to	1
the	1
softening	1
of	1
the	1
injured	1
husband	1
s	1
feelings	1
And	1
these	1
two	1
influences	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
fact	1
without	1
effect	1
though	1
the	1
result	1
remained	1
as	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
described	1
uncertain	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
Vronsky	1
retired	1
to	1
the	1
foyer	1
with	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
success	1
or	1
non	1
success	1
The	1
colonel	1
thinking	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
matter	1
further	1
but	1
then	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
satisfaction	1
proceeded	1
to	1
cross	1
examine	1
Vronsky	1
about	1
his	1
interview	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
restrain	1
his	1
laughter	1
as	1
Vronsky	1
described	1
how	1
the	1
government	1
clerk	1
after	1
subsiding	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
would	1
suddenly	1
flare	1
up	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
details	1
and	1
how	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
half	1
word	1
of	1
conciliation	1
skillfully	1
manoeuvered	1
a	1
retreat	1
shoving	1
Petritsky	1
out	1
before	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
story	1
but	1
killing	1
Kedrov	1
really	1
can	1
t	1
fight	1
the	1
gentleman	1
Was	1
he	1
so	1
awfully	1
hot	1
he	1
commented	1
laughing	1
But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
Claire	1
today	1
She	1
s	1
marvelous	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
speaking	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
French	1
actress	1
However	1
often	1
you	1
see	1
her	1
every	1
day	1
she	1

Princess	1
Betsy	1
drove	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
theater	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
act	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
her	1
dressing	1
room	1
sprinkle	1
her	1
long	1
pale	1
face	1
with	1
powder	1
rub	1
it	1
set	1
her	1
dress	1
to	1
rights	1
and	1
order	1
tea	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
carriages	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
huge	1
house	1
in	1
Bolshaia	1
Morskaia	1
Her	1
guests	1
stepped	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
wide	1
entrance	1
and	1
the	1
stout	1
porter	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
newspapers	1
in	1
the	1
mornings	1
behind	1
the	1
glass	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
edification	1
of	1
the	1
passers	1
by	1
noiselessly	1
opened	1
the	1
immense	1
door	1
letting	1
the	1
visitors	1
pass	1
by	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
hostess	1
with	1
freshly	1
arranged	1
coiffure	1
and	1
freshened	1
face	1
walked	1
in	1
at	1
one	1
door	1
and	1
her	1
guests	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
a	1
large	1
room	1
with	1
dark	1
walls	1
downy	1
rugs	1
and	1
a	1
brightly	1
lighted	1
table	1
gleaming	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
candles	1
white	1
cloth	1
silver	1
samovar	1
and	1
transparent	1
china	1
tea	1
things	1
The	1
hostess	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
gloves	1
Chairs	1
were	1
set	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
footmen	1
moving	1
almost	1
imperceptibly	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
party	1
settled	1
itself	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
groups	1
one	1
round	1
the	1
samovar	1
near	1
the	1
hostess	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
round	1
the	1
handsome	1
wife	1
of	1
an	1
ambassador	1
in	1
black	1
velvet	1
with	1
sharply	1
defined	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
In	1
both	1
groups	1
conversation	1
wavered	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
does	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
minutes	1
broken	1
up	1
by	1
meetings	1
greetings	1
offers	1
of	1
tea	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
feeling	1
about	1
for	1
something	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
She	1
s	1
exceptionally	1
good	1
as	1
an	1
actress	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
she	1
s	1
studied	1
Kaulbach	1
said	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
attach'e	1
in	1
the	1
group	1
round	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
Did	1
you	1
notice	1
how	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
Oh	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
Nilsson	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
possibly	1
say	1
anything	1
new	1
about	1
her	1
said	1
a	1
fat	1
red	1
faced	1
flaxen	1
headed	1
lady	1
without	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
chignon	1
wearing	1
an	1
old	1
silk	1
dress	1
This	1
was	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
noted	1
for	1
her	1
simplicity	1
and	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
her	1
manners	1
and	1
nicknamed	1
enfant	1
terrible	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
groups	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
both	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Three	1
people	1
have	1
used	1
that	1
very	1
phrase	1
about	1
Kaulbach	1
to	1
me	1
today	1
already	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
compact	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
why	1
they	1
liked	1
that	1
remark	1
so	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
this	1
observation	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
subject	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
again	1
Do	1
tell	1
me	1
something	1
amusing	1
but	1
not	1
spiteful	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
a	1
great	1
proficient	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
that	1
elegant	1
conversation	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
English	1
small	1
talk	1
She	1
addressed	1
the	1
attach'e	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
now	1
what	1
to	1
begin	1
upon	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
difficult	1
task	1
that	1
nothing	1
s	1
amusing	1
that	1
isn	1
t	1
spiteful	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
But	1
I	1
ll	1
try	1
Get	1
me	1
a	1
subject	1
It	1
all	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
If	1
a	1
subject	1
s	1
given	1
me	1
it	1
s	1
easy	1
to	1
spin	1
something	1
round	1
it	1
I	1
often	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
celebrated	1
talkers	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
century	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
talk	1
cleverly	1
now	1
Everything	1
clever	1
is	1
so	1
stale	1
That	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
long	1
ago	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
interrupted	1
him	1
laughing	1
The	1
conversation	1
began	1
amiably	1
but	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
amiable	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop	1
again	1
They	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
sure	1
never	1
failing	1
topic	1
gossip	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
think	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
Louis	1
Quinze	1
about	1
Tushkevitch	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
towards	1
a	1
handsome	1
fair	1
haired	1
young	1
man	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
Oh	1
yes	1
He	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
as	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
often	1
here	1
This	1
conversation	1
was	1
maintained	1
since	1
it	1
rested	1
on	1
allusions	1
to	1
what	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
talked	1
of	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
Tushkevitch	1
with	1
their	1
hostess	1
Round	1
the	1
samovar	1
and	1
the	1
hostess	1
the	1
conversation	1
had	1
been	1
meanwhile	1
vacillating	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
between	1
three	1
inevitable	1
topics	1
the	1
latest	1
piece	1
of	1
public	1
news	1
the	1
theater	1
and	1
scandal	1
It	1
too	1
came	1
finally	1
to	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
topic	1
that	1
is	1
ill	1
natured	1
gossip	1
Have	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
Maltishtcheva	1
woman	1
the	1
mother	1
not	1
the	1
daughter	1
has	1
ordered	1
a	1
costume	1
in	1
diable	1
rose	1
color	1
Nonsense	1
No	1
that	1
s	1
too	1
lovely	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
with	1
her	1
sense	1
for	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
fool	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
funny	1
she	1
is	1
Everyone	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
censure	1
or	1
ridicule	1
of	1
the	1
luckless	1
Madame	1
Maltishtcheva	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
crackled	1
merrily	1
like	1
a	1
burning	1
faggot	1
stack	1
The	1
husband	1
of	1

room	1
before	1
going	1
to	1

noiselessly	1
over	1

went	1
up	1

Oh	1

How	1

ground	1
and	1

about	1

Come	1

But	1
you	1

t	1

such	1
things	1
Oh	1

me	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
learning	1
about	1

at	1

names	1
the	1
bankers	1
they	1

some	1
splendid	1
engravings	1
They	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
us	1
Why	1

you	1

at	1
the	1
Sch"utzburgs	1
asked	1
the	1
hostess	1
from	1
the	1
samovar	1
Yes	1
ma	1
ch`ere	1
They	1
asked	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
me	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
told	1
us	1
the	1
sauce	1
at	1
that	1
dinner	1

a	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
said	1
speaking	1
loudly	1
and	1
conscious	1
everyone	1
was	1
listening	1
and	1
very	1
nasty	1
sauce	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
green	1
mess	1
We	1
had	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
made	1
them	1
sauce	1
for	1
eighteen	1
pence	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
run	1
to	1
hundred	1
pound	1
sauces	1
She	1
s	1
unique	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Marvelous	1
said	1
someone	1
The	1
sensation	1
produced	1
by	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
s	1
speeches	1
was	1
always	1
unique	1
and	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
sensation	1
she	1
produced	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
spoke	1
not	1
always	1
appropriately	1
as	1
now	1
she	1
said	1
simple	1
things	1
with	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
lived	1
such	1
plain	1
statements	1
produced	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
wittiest	1
epigram	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
could	1
never	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
that	1
effect	1
but	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
had	1
and	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
it	1
As	1
everyone	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
while	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
spoke	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
conversation	1
around	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
had	1
dropped	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
tried	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
together	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
Will	1
you	1
really	1
not	1
have	1
tea	1
You	1
should	1
come	1
over	1
here	1
by	1
us	1
No	1
we	1
re	1
very	1
happy	1
here	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
responded	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
conversation	1
They	1
were	1
criticizing	1
the	1
Karenins	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
Anna	1
is	1
quite	1
changed	1
since	1
her	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
There	1
s	1
something	1
strange	1
about	1
her	1
said	1
her	1
friend	1
The	1
great	1
change	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
brought	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
Well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
fable	1
of	1
Grimm	1
s	1
about	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
a	1
shadow	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
s	1
lost	1
his	1
shadow	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
his	1
punishment	1
for	1
something	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
punishment	1
But	1
a	1
woman	1
must	1
dislike	1
being	1
without	1
a	1
shadow	1
Yes	1
but	1
women	1
with	1
a	1
shadow	1
usually	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
bad	1
end	1
said	1
Anna	1
s	1
friend	1
Bad	1
luck	1
to	1
your	1
tongue	1
said	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
suddenly	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
s	1
a	1
splendid	1
woman	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
her	1
very	1
much	1
Why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
like	1
her	1
husband	1
He	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
remarkable	1
man	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
My	1
husband	1
says	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
statesmen	1
like	1
him	1
in	1
Europe	1
And	1
my	1
husband	1
tells	1
me	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
said	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
If	1
our	1
husbands	1
didn	1
t	1
talk	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
should	1
see	1
the	1
facts	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
but	1
doesn	1
t	1
it	1
really	1
make	1
everything	1
clear	1
Before	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
consider	1
him	1
clever	1
I	1
kept	1
looking	1
for	1
his	1
ability	1
and	1
thought	1
myself	1
a	1
fool	1
for	1
not	1
seeing	1
it	1
but	1
directly	1
I	1
said	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
fool	1
	1
though	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
everything	1
s	1
explained	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
How	1
spiteful	1
you	1
are	1
today	1
Not	1
a	1
bit	1
I	1
d	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fool	1
And	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
of	1
oneself	1
No	1
one	1
is	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
fortune	1
and	1
everyone	1
is	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
wit	1
The	1
attach'e	1
repeated	1
the	1
French	1
saying	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
it	1
just	1
it	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
abandon	1
Anna	1
to	1
your	1
mercies	1
She	1
s	1
so	1
nice	1
so	1
charming	1
How	1
can	1
she	1
help	1
it	1
if	1
they	1
re	1
all	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
follow	1
her	1
about	1
like	1
shadows	1
Oh	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
blaming	1
her	1
for	1
it	1
Anna	1
s	1
friend	1
said	1
in	1
self	1
defense	1
If	1
no	1
one	1
follows	1
us	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
shadow	1
that	1
s	1
no	1
proof	1
that	1
we	1
ve	1
any	1
right	1
to	1
blame	1
her	1
And	1
having	1
duly	1
disposed	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
friend	1
the	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
joined	1
the	1
group	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Prussia	1
What	1
wicked	1
gossip	1
were	1
you	1
talking	1
over	1
there	1
asked	1
Betsy	1
About	1
the	1
Karenins	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
us	1
a	1
sketch	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
Pity	1
we	1
didn	1
t	1
hear	1
it	1
said	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
glancing	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
Ah	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
persons	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
meeting	1
here	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
all	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
quiet	1
manner	1
with	1
which	1
one	1
enters	1
a	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
from	1
whom	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
just	1
parted	1
Where	1
do	1
I	1
come	1
from	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
question	1
from	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
Well	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
From	1
the	1
opera	1
bouffe	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
it	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
fresh	1
enjoyment	1
It	1
s	1
exquisite	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
disgraceful	1
but	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
the	1
opera	1
and	1
I	1
sit	1
out	1
the	1
opera	1
bouffe	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
minute	1
and	1
enjoy	1
it	1
This	1
evening	1
He	1
mentioned	1
a	1
French	1
actress	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
something	1
about	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
with	1
playful	1
horror	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
tell	1
us	1
about	1
that	1
horror	1
All	1
right	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
especially	1
as	1
everyone	1
knows	1
those	1
horrors	1
And	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
accepted	1
as	1
the	1
correct	1
thing	1
like	1
the	1
opera	1
chimed	1
in	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Steps	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
knowing	1
it	1
was	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
glanced	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
strange	1
new	1
expression	1
Joyfully	1
intently	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
timidly	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
figure	1
and	1
slowly	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
Anna	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
Holding	1
herself	1
extremely	1
erect	1
as	1
always	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
moving	1
with	1
her	1
swift	1
resolute	1
and	1
light	1
step	1
that	1
distinguished	1
her	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
society	1
women	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
short	1
space	1
to	1
her	1
hostess	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
her	1
smiled	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
looked	1
around	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
Vronsky	1
bowed	1
low	1
and	1
pushed	1
a	1
chair	1
up	1
for	1
her	1
She	1
acknowledged	1
this	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
slight	1
nod	1
flushed	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
frowned	1
But	1
immediately	1
while	1
rapidly	1
greeting	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
shaking	1
the	1
hands	1
proffered	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
addressed	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
s	1
and	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
here	1
earlier	1
but	1
I	1
stayed	1
on	1
Sir	1
John	1
was	1
there	1
He	1
s	1
very	1
interesting	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
this	1
missionary	1
Yes	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
about	1
the	1
life	1
in	1
India	1
most	1
interesting	1
things	1
The	1
conversation	1
interrupted	1
by	1
her	1
coming	1
in	1
flickered	1
up	1
again	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
lamp	1
being	1
blown	1
out	1
Sir	1
John	1
Yes	1
Sir	1
John	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
him	1
He	1
speaks	1
well	1
The	1
Vlassieva	1
girl	1
s	1
quite	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
the	1
younger	1
Vlassieva	1
girl	1
s	1
to	1
marry	1
Topov	1
Yes	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
quite	1
a	1
settled	1
thing	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
parents	1
They	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
marriage	1
for	1
love	1
For	1
love	1
What	1
antediluvian	1
notions	1
you	1
have	1
Can	1
one	1
talk	1
of	1
love	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
What	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
foolish	1
old	1
fashion	1
that	1
s	1
kept	1
up	1
still	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
fashion	1
The	1
only	1
happy	1
marriages	1
I	1
know	1
are	1
marriages	1
of	1
prudence	1
Yes	1
but	1
then	1
how	1
often	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
these	1
prudent	1
marriages	1
flies	1
away	1
like	1
dust	1
just	1
because	1
that	1
passion	1
turns	1
up	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
recognize	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
But	1
by	1
marriages	1
of	1
prudence	1
we	1
mean	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
both	1
parties	1
have	1
sown	1
their	1
wild	1
oats	1
already	1
That	1
s	1
like	1
scarlatina	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
it	1
and	1
get	1
it	1
over	1
Then	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
how	1
to	1
vaccinate	1
for	1
love	1
like	1
smallpox	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
in	1
my	1
young	1
days	1
with	1
a	1
deacon	1
said	1
the	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
me	1
any	1
good	1
No	1
I	1
imagine	1
joking	1
apart	1
that	1
to	1
know	1
love	1
one	1
must	1
make	1
mistakes	1
and	1
then	1
correct	1
them	1
said	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
Even	1
after	1
marriage	1
said	1
the	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
playfully	1
It	1
s	1
never	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
mend	1
The	1
attach'e	1
repeated	1
the	1
English	1
proverb	1
Just	1
so	1
Betsy	1
agreed	1
one	1
must	1
make	1
mistakes	1
and	1
correct	1
them	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Anna	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
faintly	1
perceptible	1
resolute	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
was	1
listening	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
I	1
think	1
said	1
Anna	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
glove	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
men	1
so	1
many	1
minds	1
certainly	1
so	1
many	1
hearts	1
so	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
love	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
Anna	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
fainting	1
heart	1
waiting	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
He	1
sighed	1
as	1
after	1
a	1
danger	1
escaped	1
when	1
she	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
Anna	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
Oh	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Moscow	1
They	1
write	1
me	1
that	1
Kitty	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
s	1
very	1
ill	1
Really	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows	1
Anna	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
him	1
That	1
doesn	1
t	1
interest	1
you	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
does	1
very	1
much	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
exactly	1
they	1
told	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
he	1
questioned	1
Anna	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Betsy	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
she	1
said	1
standing	1
at	1
her	1
table	1
While	1
Betsy	1
was	1
pouring	1
out	1
the	1
tea	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
repeated	1
I	1
often	1
think	1
men	1
have	1
no	1
understanding	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
not	1
honorable	1
though	1
they	1
re	1
always	1
talking	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
Anna	1
without	1
answering	1
him	1
I	1
ve	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
added	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
away	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
covered	1
with	1
albums	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
quite	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
your	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
handing	1
her	1
the	1
cup	1
She	1
glanced	1
towards	1
the	1
sofa	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
instantly	1
sat	1
down	1
Yes	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
wanting	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
You	1
behaved	1
wrongly	1
very	1
wrongly	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
acted	1
wrongly	1
But	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
doing	1
so	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
glancing	1
severely	1
at	1
him	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
for	1
he	1
answered	1
boldly	1
and	1
joyfully	1
meeting	1
her	1
glance	1
and	1
not	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyes	1
Not	1
he	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
confused	1
That	1
only	1
shows	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
heart	1
she	1
said	1
But	1
her	1
eyes	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
What	1
you	1
spoke	1
of	1
just	1
now	1
was	1
a	1
mistake	1
and	1
not	1
love	1
Remember	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
forbidden	1
you	1
to	1
utter	1
that	1
word	1
that	1
hateful	1
word	1
said	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
shudder	1
But	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
by	1
that	1
very	1
word	1
forbidden	1
she	1
had	1
shown	1
that	1
she	1
acknowledged	1
certain	1
rights	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
very	1
fact	1
was	1
encouraging	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
love	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
looking	1
resolutely	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
hot	1
all	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
burning	1
flush	1
on	1
her	1
cheeks	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
on	1
purpose	1
this	1
evening	1
knowing	1
I	1
should	1
meet	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
end	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
blushed	1
before	1
anyone	1
and	1
you	1
force	1
me	1
to	1
feel	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
something	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
spiritual	1
beauty	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
simply	1
and	1
seriously	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
Kitty	1
s	1
forgiveness	1
she	1
said	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
He	1
saw	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
what	1
she	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
say	1
not	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
she	1
whispered	1
do	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
radiant	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
me	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
peace	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
myself	1
and	1
love	1
yes	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
myself	1
apart	1
You	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
one	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
chance	1
before	1
us	1
of	1
peace	1
for	1
me	1
or	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
despair	1
of	1
wretchedness	1
or	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
bliss	1
what	1
bliss	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
murmured	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
but	1
she	1
heard	1
She	1
strained	1
every	1
effort	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
let	1
her	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
him	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
It	1
s	1
come	1
he	1
thought	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
despair	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
end	1
it	1
s	1
come	1
She	1
loves	1
me	1
She	1
owns	1
it	1
Then	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
me	1
never	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
friends	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
words	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
spoke	1
quite	1
differently	1
Friends	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
yourself	1
Whether	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
happiest	1
or	1
the	1
wretchedest	1
of	1
people	1
that	1
s	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
interrupted	1
her	1
I	1
ask	1
one	1
thing	1
only	1
I	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
hope	1
to	1
suffer	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
But	1
if	1
even	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
command	1
me	1
to	1
disappear	1
and	1
I	1
disappear	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me	1
if	1
my	1
presence	1
is	1
distasteful	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
drive	1
you	1
away	1
Only	1
don	1
t	1
change	1
anything	1
leave	1
everything	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaky	1
voice	1
Here	1
s	1
your	1
husband	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
walk	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
calm	1
awkward	1
gait	1
Glancing	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
began	1
talking	1
in	1
his	1
deliberate	1
always	1
audible	1
voice	1
in	1
his	1
habitual	1
tone	1
of	1
banter	1
ridiculing	1
someone	1
Your	1
Rambouillet	1
is	1
in	1
full	1
conclave	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
the	1
graces	1
and	1
the	1
muses	1
But	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
sneering	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
using	1
the	1
English	1
word	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
skillful	1
hostess	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
serious	1
conversation	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
universal	1
conscription	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
immediately	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
began	1
seriously	1
defending	1
the	1
new	1
imperial	1
decree	1
against	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
who	1
had	1
attacked	1
it	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
still	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
This	1
is	1
getting	1
indecorous	1
whispered	1
one	1
lady	1
with	1
an	1
expressive	1
glance	1
at	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
What	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
said	1
Anna	1
s	1
friend	1
But	1
not	1
only	1
those	1
ladies	1
almost	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
even	1
the	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
and	1
Betsy	1
herself	1
looked	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
circle	1
as	1
though	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
disturbing	1
fact	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
look	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
diverted	1
from	1
the	1
interesting	1
discussion	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
upon	1
Noticing	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
made	1
on	1
everyone	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
slipped	1
someone	1
else	1
into	1
her	1
place	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
I	1
m	1
always	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
clearness	1
and	1
precision	1
of	1
your	1
husband	1
s	1
language	1
she	1
said	1
The	1
most	1
transcendental	1
ideas	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
within	1
my	1
grasp	1
when	1
he	1
s	1
speaking	1
Oh	1
yes	1
said	1
Anna	1
radiant	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
not	1
understanding	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
Betsy	1
had	1
said	1
She	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
table	1
and	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
after	1
staying	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
suggested	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
home	1
together	1
But	1
she	1
answered	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
staying	1
to	1
supper	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
made	1
his	1
bows	1
and	1
withdrew	1
The	1
fat	1
old	1
Tatar	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
s	1
coachman	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
holding	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
pair	1
of	1
grays	1
chilled	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
rearing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
A	1
footman	1
stood	1
opening	1
the	1
carriage	1
door	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
stood	1
holding	1
open	1
the	1
great	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
with	1
her	1
quick	1
little	1
hand	1
was	1
unfastening	1
the	1
lace	1
of	1
her	1
sleeve	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
hook	1
of	1
her	1
fur	1
cloak	1
and	1
with	1
bent	1
head	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
Vronsky	1
murmured	1
as	1
he	1
escorted	1
her	1
down	1
You	1
ve	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
course	1
and	1
I	1
ask	1
nothing	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
friendship	1
s	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
happiness	1
in	1
life	1
for	1
me	1
that	1
word	1
that	1
you	1
dislike	1
so	1
yes	1
love	1
Love	1
she	1
repeated	1
slowly	1
in	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
and	1
suddenly	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
she	1
unhooked	1
the	1
lace	1
she	1
added	1
Why	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
means	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
me	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
can	1
understand	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
Au	1
revoir	1
	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
rapid	1
springy	1
step	1
she	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
porter	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
Her	1
glance	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
set	1
him	1
aflame	1
He	1
kissed	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
touched	1
it	1
and	1
went	1
home	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
his	1
aims	1
that	1
evening	1
than	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
months	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
seen	1
nothing	1
striking	1
or	1
improper	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
apart	1
in	1
eager	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
something	1
But	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
this	1
appeared	1
something	1
striking	1
and	1
improper	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
too	1
to	1
be	1
improper	1
He	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
On	1
reaching	1
home	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
low	1
chair	1
opened	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
Papacy	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
the	1
paper	1
knife	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
read	1
till	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
But	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
rubbed	1
his	1
high	1
forehead	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1
something	1
At	1
his	1
usual	1
time	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
toilet	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
in	1
With	1
a	1
book	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
went	1
upstairs	1
But	1
this	1
evening	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
thoughts	1
and	1
meditations	1
upon	1
official	1
details	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
absorbed	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
something	1
disagreeable	1
connected	1
with	1
her	1
Contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
habit	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
bed	1
but	1
fell	1
to	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
rooms	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
clasped	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
needful	1
for	1
him	1
first	1
to	1
think	1
thoroughly	1
over	1
the	1
position	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
arisen	1
When	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
very	1
easy	1
and	1
simple	1
matter	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
presented	1
itself	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
complicated	1
and	1
difficult	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
jealous	1
Jealousy	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
notions	1
was	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
Why	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
confidence	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
complete	1
conviction	1
that	1
his	1
young	1
wife	1
would	1
always	1
love	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
himself	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
experience	1
of	1
lack	1
of	1
confidence	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
and	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
Now	1
though	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
jealousy	1
was	1
a	1
shameful	1
feeling	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
confidence	1
had	1
not	1
broken	1
down	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
something	1
illogical	1
and	1
irrational	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
standing	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
loving	1
someone	1
other	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
irrational	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
life	1
itself	1
All	1
his	1
life	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
lived	1
and	1
worked	1
in	1
official	1
spheres	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
life	1
And	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
stumbled	1
against	1
life	1
itself	1
he	1
had	1
shrunk	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
Now	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
while	1
calmly	1
crossing	1
a	1
precipice	1
by	1
a	1
bridge	1
should	1
suddenly	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
broken	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
chasm	1
below	1
That	1
chasm	1
was	1
life	1
itself	1
the	1
bridge	1
that	1
artificial	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
lived	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
loving	1
someone	1
else	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
it	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
undress	1
but	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
regular	1
tread	1
over	1
the	1
resounding	1
parquet	1
of	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
one	1
lamp	1
was	1
burning	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
big	1
new	1
portrait	1
of	1
himself	1
hanging	1
over	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
across	1
her	1
boudoir	1
where	1
two	1
candles	1
burned	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
portraits	1
of	1
her	1
parents	1
and	1
woman	1
friends	1
and	1
the	1
pretty	1
knick	1
knacks	1
of	1
her	1
writing	1
table	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
He	1
walked	1
across	1
her	1
boudoir	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door	1
and	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
At	1
each	1
turn	1
in	1
his	1
walk	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
parquet	1
of	1
the	1
lighted	1
dining	1
room	1
he	1
halted	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
Yes	1
this	1
I	1
must	1
decide	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
I	1
must	1
express	1
my	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
my	1
decision	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
But	1
express	1
what	1
what	1
decision	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
reply	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
before	1
turning	1
into	1
the	1
boudoir	1
what	1
has	1
occurred	1
Nothing	1
She	1
was	1
talking	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
with	1
him	1
But	1
what	1
of	1
that	1
Surely	1
women	1
in	1
society	1
can	1
talk	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
please	1
And	1
then	1
jealousy	1
means	1
lowering	1
both	1
myself	1
and	1
her	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
but	1
this	1
dictum	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
such	1
weight	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
weight	1
and	1
no	1
meaning	1
at	1
all	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
others	1
noticed	1
it	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
Yes	1
I	1
must	1
decide	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
express	1
my	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
Decide	1
how	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
What	1
had	1
occurred	1
and	1
answered	1
Nothing	1
and	1
recollected	1
that	1
jealousy	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
insulting	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
His	1
thoughts	1
like	1
his	1
body	1
went	1
round	1
a	1
complete	1
circle	1
without	1
coming	1
upon	1
anything	1
new	1
He	1
noticed	1
this	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
boudoir	1
There	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
malachite	1
blotting	1
case	1
lying	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
and	1
an	1
unfinished	1
letter	1
his	1
thoughts	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
pictured	1
vividly	1
to	1
himself	1
her	1
personal	1
life	1
her	1
ideas	1
her	1
desires	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
separate	1
life	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
alarming	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
dispel	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
chasm	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
peep	1
into	1
To	1
put	1
himself	1
in	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
in	1
another	1
person	1
s	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
spiritual	1
exercise	1
not	1
natural	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
He	1
looked	1
on	1
this	1
spiritual	1
exercise	1
as	1
a	1
harmful	1
and	1
dangerous	1
abuse	1
of	1
the	1
fancy	1
And	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
thought	1
he	1
is	1
that	1
just	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
my	1
great	1
work	1
is	1
approaching	1
completion	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
project	1
he	1
was	1
bringing	1
forward	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
mental	1
peace	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
energies	1
just	1
now	1
this	1
stupid	1
worry	1
should	1
fall	1
foul	1
of	1
me	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
submit	1
to	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
worry	1
without	1
having	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
character	1
to	1
face	1
them	1
I	1
must	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
decision	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
passed	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
passing	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
affair	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
her	1
conscience	1
and	1
falls	1
under	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
religion	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
consolation	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
to	1
which	1
division	1
of	1
regulating	1
principles	1
this	1
new	1
circumstance	1
could	1
be	1
properly	1
referred	1
And	1
so	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
feelings	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
are	1
questions	1
for	1
her	1
conscience	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
My	1
duty	1
is	1
clearly	1
defined	1
As	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
person	1
bound	1
in	1
duty	1
to	1
guide	1
her	1
and	1
consequently	1
in	1
part	1
the	1
person	1
responsible	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
danger	1
I	1
perceive	1
to	1
warn	1
her	1
even	1
to	1
use	1
my	1
authority	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak	1
plainly	1
to	1
her	1
And	1
everything	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
tonight	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
took	1
clear	1
shape	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
head	1
Thinking	1
over	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
somewhat	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
mental	1
powers	1
for	1
domestic	1
consumption	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
to	1
show	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
the	1
form	1
and	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
speech	1
before	1
him	1
shaped	1
itself	1
as	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
ministerial	1
report	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
and	1
express	1
fully	1
the	1
following	1
points	1
first	1
exposition	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
to	1
be	1
attached	1
to	1
public	1
opinion	1
and	1
to	1
decorum	1
secondly	1
exposition	1
of	1
religious	1
significance	1
of	1
marriage	1
thirdly	1
if	1
need	1
be	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
calamity	1
possibly	1
ensuing	1
to	1
our	1
son	1
fourthly	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
unhappiness	1
likely	1
to	1
result	1
to	1
herself	1
And	1
interlacing	1
his	1
fingers	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stretched	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
the	1
fingers	1
cracked	1
This	1
trick	1
a	1
bad	1
habit	1
the	1
cracking	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
always	1
soothed	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
precision	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts	1
so	1
needful	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
juncture	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
driving	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
halted	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
A	1
woman	1
s	1
step	1
was	1
heard	1
mounting	1
the	1
stairs	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
speech	1
stood	1
compressing	1
his	1
crossed	1
fingers	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
crack	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
One	1
joint	1
cracked	1
Already	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
light	1
steps	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
close	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
speech	1
he	1
felt	1
frightened	1
of	1
the	1
explanation	1
confronting	1
him	1
Chapter	1
9	1
Anna	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
hanging	1
head	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
tassels	1
of	1
her	1
hood	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
brilliant	1
and	1
glowing	1
but	1
this	1
glow	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
brightness	1
it	1
suggested	1
the	1
fearful	1
glow	1
of	1
a	1
conflagration	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
night	1
On	1
seeing	1
her	1
husband	1
Anna	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
smiled	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
waked	1
up	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
in	1
bed	1
What	1
a	1
wonder	1
she	1
said	1
letting	1
fall	1
her	1
hood	1
and	1
without	1
stopping	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
into	1
the	1
dressing	1
room	1
It	1
s	1
late	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
doorway	1
Anna	1
it	1
s	1
necessary	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
With	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
wonderingly	1
She	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
dressing	1
room	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
What	1
about	1
she	1
asked	1
sitting	1
down	1
Well	1
let	1
s	1
talk	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
necessary	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
sleep	1
Anna	1
said	1
what	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
marveled	1
hearing	1
herself	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
capacity	1
for	1
lying	1
How	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
were	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
how	1
likely	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
sleepy	1
She	1
felt	1
herself	1
clad	1
in	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
armor	1
of	1
falsehood	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
some	1
unseen	1
force	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
aid	1
and	1
was	1
supporting	1
her	1
Anna	1
I	1
must	1
warn	1
you	1
he	1
began	1
Warn	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
Of	1
what	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
so	1
simply	1
so	1
brightly	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
knew	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
noticed	1
anything	1
unnatural	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
or	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
words	1
But	1
to	1
him	1
knowing	1
her	1
knowing	1
that	1
whenever	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
than	1
usual	1
she	1
noticed	1
it	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
reason	1
to	1
him	1
knowing	1
that	1
every	1
joy	1
every	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pain	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
communicated	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
notice	1
his	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
herself	1
meant	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
inmost	1
recesses	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
that	1
had	1
always	1
hitherto	1
lain	1
open	1
before	1
him	1
were	1
closed	1
against	1
him	1
More	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
from	1
her	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
perturbed	1
at	1
that	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
said	1
straight	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
shut	1
up	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
future	1
Now	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
returning	1
home	1
and	1
finding	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
locked	1
up	1
But	1
perhaps	1
the	1
key	1
may	1
yet	1
be	1
found	1
thought	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
warn	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
that	1
through	1
thoughtlessness	1
and	1
lack	1
of	1
caution	1
you	1
may	1
cause	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
about	1
in	1
society	1
Your	1
too	1
animated	1
conversation	1
this	1
evening	1
with	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
enunciated	1
the	1
name	1
firmly	1
and	1
with	1
deliberate	1
emphasis	1
attracted	1
attention	1
He	1
talked	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
which	1
frightened	1
him	1
now	1
with	1
their	1
impenetrable	1
look	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
he	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
uselessness	1
and	1
idleness	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
You	1
re	1
always	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
answered	1
as	1
though	1
completely	1
misapprehending	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
only	1
taking	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
phrase	1
One	1
time	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
my	1
being	1
dull	1
and	1
another	1
time	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
my	1
being	1
lively	1
I	1
wasn	1
t	1
dull	1
Does	1
that	1
offend	1
you	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
shivered	1
and	1
bent	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
joints	1
crack	1
Oh	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
so	1
dislike	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
Anna	1
is	1
this	1
you	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
quietly	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
over	1
himself	1
and	1
restraining	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
such	1
genuine	1
and	1
droll	1
wonder	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
paused	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
intended	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
warning	1
his	1
wife	1
against	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
become	1
agitated	1
over	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
her	1
conscience	1
and	1
was	1
struggling	1
against	1
the	1
barrier	1
he	1
fancied	1
between	1
them	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
coldly	1
and	1
composedly	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
it	1
I	1
consider	1
jealousy	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
a	1
humiliating	1
and	1
degrading	1
feeling	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
it	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
rules	1
of	1
decorum	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
disregarded	1
with	1
impunity	1
This	1
evening	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
I	1
observed	1
it	1
but	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
company	1
everyone	1
observed	1
that	1
your	1
conduct	1
and	1
deportment	1
were	1
not	1
altogether	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
I	1
positively	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
said	1
Anna	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
care	1
she	1
thought	1
But	1
other	1
people	1
noticed	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
upsets	1
him	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
well	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
she	1
added	1
and	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
he	1
moved	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
stop	1
her	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
ugly	1
and	1
forbidding	1
as	1
Anna	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
him	1
She	1
stopped	1
and	1
bending	1
her	1
head	1
back	1
and	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
began	1
with	1
her	1
rapid	1
hand	1
taking	1
out	1
her	1
hairpins	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
come	1
she	1
said	1
calmly	1
and	1
ironically	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
listen	1
with	1
interest	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
She	1
spoke	1
and	1
marveled	1
at	1
the	1
confident	1
calm	1
and	1
natural	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
used	1
To	1
enter	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
your	1
feelings	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
and	1
besides	1
I	1
regard	1
that	1
as	1
useless	1
and	1
even	1
harmful	1
began	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Ferreting	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
soul	1
one	1
often	1
ferrets	1
out	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
lain	1
there	1
unnoticed	1
Your	1
feelings	1
are	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
conscience	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
duty	1
bound	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
your	1
duties	1
Our	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
joined	1
not	1
by	1
man	1
but	1
by	1
God	1
That	1
union	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
severed	1
by	1
a	1
crime	1
and	1
a	1
crime	1
of	1
that	1
nature	1
brings	1
its	1
own	1
chastisement	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
And	1
oh	1
dear	1
how	1
sleepy	1
I	1
am	1
unluckily	1
she	1
said	1
rapidly	1
passing	1
her	1
hand	1
through	1
her	1
hair	1
feeling	1
for	1
the	1
remaining	1
hairpins	1
Anna	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
speak	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
gently	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
am	1
mistaken	1
but	1
believe	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
say	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
myself	1
as	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
husband	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
her	1
face	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
mocking	1
gleam	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
died	1
away	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
love	1
threw	1
her	1
into	1
revolt	1
again	1
She	1
thought	1
Love	1
Can	1
he	1
love	1
If	1
he	1
hadn	1
t	1
heard	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
love	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
love	1
is	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
really	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
Define	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
find	1
Pardon	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
myself	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
persons	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
are	1
our	1
son	1
and	1
yourself	1
It	1
may	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
I	1
repeat	1
that	1
my	1
words	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
utterly	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
called	1
forth	1
by	1
my	1
mistaken	1
impression	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
conscious	1
yourself	1
of	1
even	1
the	1
smallest	1
foundation	1
for	1
them	1
then	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
think	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
if	1
your	1
heart	1
prompts	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
saying	1
something	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
And	1
besides	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressing	1
a	1
smile	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
bed	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
and	1
without	1
saying	1
more	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
bed	1
His	1
lips	1
were	1
sternly	1
compressed	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
looked	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
Anna	1
got	1
into	1
her	1
bed	1
and	1
lay	1
expecting	1
every	1
minute	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
again	1
She	1
both	1
feared	1
his	1
speaking	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
it	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
She	1
waited	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
without	1
moving	1
and	1
had	1
forgotten	1
about	1
him	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
she	1
pictured	1
him	1
and	1
felt	1
how	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
flooded	1
with	1
emotion	1
and	1
guilty	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
heard	1
an	1
even	1
tranquil	1
snore	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
seemed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
appalled	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
snoring	1
and	1
ceased	1
but	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
two	1
breathings	1
the	1
snore	1
sounded	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
tranquil	1
rhythm	1
It	1
s	1
late	1
it	1
s	1
late	1
she	1
whispered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
A	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
lay	1
not	1
moving	1
with	1
open	1
eyes	1
whose	1
brilliance	1
she	1
almost	1
fancied	1
she	1
could	1
herself	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
Chapter	1
10	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
began	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
Nothing	1
special	1
happened	1
Anna	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
society	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
done	1
was	1
particularly	1
often	1
at	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
s	1
and	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
everywhere	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
this	1
but	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
All	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
open	1
discussion	1
she	1
confronted	1
with	1
a	1
barrier	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
penetrate	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
amused	1
perplexity	1
Outwardly	1
everything	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
their	1
inner	1
relations	1
were	1
completely	1
changed	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
politics	1
felt	1
himself	1
helpless	1
in	1
this	1
Like	1
an	1
ox	1
with	1
head	1
bent	1
submissively	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
blow	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
was	1
lifted	1
over	1
him	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
try	1
once	1
more	1
that	1
by	1
kindness	1
tenderness	1
and	1
persuasion	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
hope	1
of	1
saving	1
her	1
of	1
bringing	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
deceit	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
had	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
too	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
quite	1
unlike	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
talk	1
Involuntarily	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
habitual	1
tone	1
of	1
jeering	1
at	1
anyone	1
who	1
should	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
tone	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
needed	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Chapter	1
11	1
That	1
which	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
the	1
one	1
absorbing	1
desire	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
replacing	1
all	1
his	1
old	1
desires	1
that	1
which	1
for	1
Anna	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
impossible	1
terrible	1
and	1
even	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
more	1
entrancing	1
dream	1
of	1
bliss	1
that	1
desire	1
had	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
He	1
stood	1
before	1
her	1
pale	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
quivering	1
and	1
besought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
Anna	1
Anna	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
choking	1
voice	1
Anna	1
for	1
pity	1
s	1
sake	1
But	1
the	1
louder	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
lower	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
once	1
proud	1
and	1
gay	1
now	1
shame	1
stricken	1
head	1
and	1
she	1
bowed	1
down	1
and	1
sank	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
held	1
her	1
My	1
God	1
Forgive	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
sobbing	1
pressing	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
She	1
felt	1
so	1
sinful	1
so	1
guilty	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
left	1
her	1
but	1
to	1
humiliate	1
herself	1
and	1
beg	1
forgiveness	1
and	1
as	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
but	1
him	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
addressed	1
her	1
prayer	1
for	1
forgiveness	1
Looking	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
physical	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
humiliation	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
more	1
He	1
felt	1
what	1
a	1
murderer	1
must	1
feel	1
when	1
he	1
sees	1
the	1
body	1
he	1
has	1
robbed	1
of	1
life	1
That	1
body	1
robbed	1
by	1
him	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
their	1
love	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
awful	1
and	1
revolting	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
bought	1
at	1
this	1
fearful	1
price	1
of	1
shame	1
Shame	1
at	1
their	1
spiritual	1
nakedness	1
crushed	1
her	1
and	1
infected	1
him	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
murderer	1
s	1
horror	1
before	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
victim	1
he	1
must	1
hack	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
hide	1
the	1
body	1
must	1
use	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
gained	1
by	1
his	1
murder	1
And	1
with	1
fury	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
passion	1
the	1
murderer	1
falls	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
drags	1
it	1
and	1
hacks	1
at	1
it	1
so	1
he	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
shoulders	1
with	1
kisses	1
She	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
Yes	1
these	1
kisses	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
bought	1
by	1
this	1
shame	1
Yes	1
and	1
one	1
hand	1
which	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
mine	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
accomplice	1
She	1
lifted	1
up	1
that	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
He	1
sank	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
she	1
hid	1
it	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
At	1
last	1
as	1
though	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
over	1
herself	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
beautiful	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
pitiful	1
for	1
that	1
All	1
is	1
over	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
you	1
Remember	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
For	1
one	1
instant	1
of	1
this	1
happiness	1
Happiness	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing	1
and	1
her	1
horror	1
unconsciously	1
infected	1
him	1
For	1
pity	1
s	1
sake	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
more	1
She	1
rose	1
quickly	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
more	1
she	1
repeated	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
chill	1
despair	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
of	1
rapture	1
and	1
of	1
horror	1
at	1
this	1
stepping	1
into	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
vulgarize	1
this	1
feeling	1
by	1
inappropriate	1
words	1
But	1
later	1
too	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
she	1
still	1
found	1
no	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
express	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
indeed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
find	1
thoughts	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
clearly	1
think	1
out	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
She	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
No	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
later	1
on	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
calmer	1
But	1
this	1
calm	1
for	1
thought	1
never	1
came	1
every	1
time	1
the	1
thought	1
rose	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
horror	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
drove	1
those	1
thoughts	1
away	1
Later	1
later	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
calmer	1
But	1
in	1
dreams	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
control	1
over	1
her	1
thoughts	1
her	1
position	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
hideous	1
nakedness	1
One	1
dream	1
haunted	1
her	1
almost	1
every	1
night	1
She	1
dreamed	1
that	1
both	1
were	1
her	1
husbands	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
both	1
were	1
lavishing	1
caresses	1
on	1
her	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
weeping	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
saying	1
How	1
happy	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
And	1
Alexey	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
there	1
too	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
marveling	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
once	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
explaining	1
to	1
them	1
laughing	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
simpler	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
But	1
this	1
dream	1
weighed	1
on	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
nightmare	1
and	1
she	1
awoke	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
terror	1
Chapter	1
12	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
Moscow	1
whenever	1
Levin	1
shuddered	1
and	1
grew	1
red	1
remembering	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
his	1
rejection	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
This	1
was	1
just	1
how	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
shudder	1
and	1
blush	1
thinking	1
myself	1
utterly	1
lost	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
plucked	1
in	1
physics	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
my	1
remove	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
thought	1
myself	1
utterly	1
ruined	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
mismanaged	1
that	1
affair	1
of	1
my	1
sister	1
s	1
that	1
was	1
entrusted	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
yet	1
now	1
that	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
I	1
recall	1
it	1
and	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
distress	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
too	1
with	1
this	1
trouble	1
Time	1
will	1
go	1
by	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
mind	1
about	1
this	1
either	1
But	1
three	1
months	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
off	1
minding	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
painful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
those	1
first	1
days	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
because	1
after	1
dreaming	1
so	1
long	1
of	1
family	1
life	1
and	1
feeling	1
himself	1
so	1
ripe	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
not	1
married	1
and	1
was	1
further	1
than	1
ever	1
from	1
marriage	1
He	1
was	1
painfully	1
conscious	1
himself	1
as	1
were	1
all	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
at	1
his	1
years	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
well	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
He	1
remembered	1
how	1
before	1
starting	1
for	1
Moscow	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
cowman	1
Nikolay	1
a	1
simple	1
hearted	1
peasant	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
talking	1
to	1
Well	1
Nikolay	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
and	1
how	1
Nikolay	1
had	1
promptly	1
answered	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
possible	1
doubt	1
And	1
high	1
time	1
too	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
But	1
marriage	1
had	1
now	1
become	1
further	1
off	1
than	1
ever	1
The	1
place	1
was	1
taken	1
and	1
whenever	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
he	1
knew	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
Moreover	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
rejection	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
played	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
tortured	1
him	1
with	1
shame	1
However	1
often	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
recollection	1
like	1
other	1
humiliating	1
reminiscences	1
of	1
a	1
similar	1
kind	1
made	1
him	1
twinge	1
and	1
blush	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
past	1
as	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
s	1
actions	1
recognized	1
by	1
him	1
as	1
bad	1
for	1
which	1
his	1
conscience	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
tormented	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
these	1
evil	1
actions	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
causing	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
suffering	1
as	1
those	1
trivial	1
but	1
humiliating	1
reminiscences	1
These	1
wounds	1
never	1
healed	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
memories	1
was	1
now	1
ranged	1
his	1
rejection	1
and	1
the	1
pitiful	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
appeared	1
to	1
others	1
that	1
evening	1
But	1
time	1
and	1
work	1
did	1
their	1
part	1
Bitter	1
memories	1
were	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
covered	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
incidents	1
paltry	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
really	1
important	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
life	1
Every	1
week	1
he	1
thought	1
less	1
often	1
of	1
Kitty	1
He	1
was	1
impatiently	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
married	1
or	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
hoping	1
that	1
such	1
news	1
would	1
like	1
having	1
a	1
tooth	1
out	1
completely	1
cure	1
him	1
Meanwhile	1
spring	1
came	1
on	1
beautiful	1
and	1
kindly	1
without	1
the	1
delays	1
and	1
treacheries	1
of	1
spring	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
springs	1
in	1
which	1
plants	1
beasts	1
and	1
man	1
rejoice	1
alike	1
This	1
lovely	1
spring	1
roused	1
Levin	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
strengthened	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
resolution	1
of	1
renouncing	1
all	1
his	1
past	1
and	1
building	1
up	1
his	1
lonely	1
life	1
firmly	1
and	1
independently	1
Though	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
plans	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
carried	1
out	1
still	1
his	1
most	1
important	1
resolution	1
that	1
of	1
purity	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
by	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
shame	1
which	1
had	1
usually	1
harassed	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
fall	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
look	1
everyone	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
In	1
February	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
health	1
was	1
getting	1
worse	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
advice	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
letter	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
and	1
succeeded	1
in	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
watering	1
place	1
abroad	1
He	1
succeeded	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
persuading	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
in	1
lending	1
him	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
without	1
irritating	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
matter	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
farming	1
which	1
called	1
for	1
special	1
attention	1
in	1
spring	1
and	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
reading	1
Levin	1
had	1
begun	1
that	1
winter	1
a	1
work	1
on	1
agriculture	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
which	1
turned	1
on	1
taking	1
into	1
account	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
unalterable	1
data	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
like	1
the	1
climate	1
and	1
the	1
soil	1
and	1
consequently	1
deducing	1
all	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
scientific	1
culture	1
not	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
data	1
of	1
soil	1
and	1
climate	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
data	1
of	1
soil	1
climate	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
unalterable	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
Thus	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
solitude	1
or	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
his	1
solitude	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
full	1
Only	1
rarely	1
he	1
suffered	1
from	1
an	1
unsatisfied	1
desire	1
to	1
communicate	1
his	1
stray	1
ideas	1
to	1
someone	1
besides	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
With	1
her	1
indeed	1
he	1
not	1
infrequently	1
fell	1
into	1
discussion	1
upon	1
physics	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
agriculture	1
and	1
especially	1
philosophy	1
philosophy	1
was	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
favorite	1
subject	1
Spring	1
was	1
slow	1
in	1
unfolding	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
weeks	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
steadily	1
fine	1
frosty	1
weather	1
In	1
the	1
daytime	1
it	1
thawed	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
but	1
at	1
night	1
there	1
were	1
even	1
seven	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost	1
There	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
frozen	1
surface	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
that	1
they	1
drove	1
the	1
wagons	1
anywhere	1
off	1
the	1
roads	1
Easter	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
Then	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
on	1
Easter	1
Monday	1
a	1
warm	1
wind	1
sprang	1
up	1
storm	1
clouds	1
swooped	1
down	1
and	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
the	1
warm	1
driving	1
rain	1
fell	1
in	1
streams	1
On	1
Thursday	1
the	1
wind	1
dropped	1
and	1
a	1
thick	1
gray	1
fog	1
brooded	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
though	1
hiding	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
transformations	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
wrought	1
in	1
nature	1
Behind	1
the	1
fog	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
flowing	1
of	1
water	1
the	1
cracking	1
and	1
floating	1
of	1
ice	1
the	1
swift	1
rush	1
of	1
turbid	1
foaming	1
torrents	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
Monday	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
fog	1
parted	1
the	1
storm	1
clouds	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
little	1
curling	1
crests	1
of	1
cloud	1
the	1
sky	1
cleared	1
and	1
the	1
real	1
spring	1
had	1
come	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
brilliant	1
and	1
quickly	1
wore	1
away	1
the	1
thin	1
layer	1
of	1

was	1
quivering	1
with	1
the	1
steam	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
quickened	1
earth	1
The	1

looked	1
greener	1
and	1
the	1

grass	1
thrust	1
up	1
its	1
tiny	1

the	1

of	1
the	1

and	1
of	1
the	1
currant	1
and	1
the	1
sticky	1
birch	1
buds	1
were	1
swollen	1
with	1

and	1
an	1
exploring	1

was	1
humming	1
about	1
the	1

that	1
studded	1

over	1

and	1

flew	1
high	1
across	1
the	1

their	1

The	1

bald	1
in	1

where	1
the	1

had	1
not	1

about	1

with	1

There	1
was	1
a	1
merry	1
chatter	1
of	1
peasant	1
women	1
over	1
their	1
linen	1
at	1
the	1
pond	1
and	1
the	1

of	1
axes	1
in	1
the	1

where	1
the	1

were	1
repairing	1

Chapter	1
13	1
Levin	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
big	1
boots	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
a	1
cloth	1
jacket	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
fur	1
cloak	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
his	1
farm	1
stepping	1
over	1
streams	1
of	1
water	1
that	1
flashed	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
dazzled	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
treading	1
one	1
minute	1
on	1
ice	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
into	1
sticky	1
mud	1
Spring	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
plans	1
and	1
projects	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
farmyard	1
Levin	1
like	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
spring	1
that	1
knows	1
not	1
what	1
form	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
shoots	1
and	1
twigs	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
its	1
swelling	1
buds	1
hardly	1
knew	1
what	1
undertakings	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
begin	1
upon	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
work	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
splendid	1
plans	1
and	1
projects	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
cattle	1
The	1
cows	1
had	1
been	1
let	1
out	1
into	1
their	1
paddock	1
and	1
their	1
smooth	1
sides	1
were	1
already	1
shining	1
with	1
their	1
new	1
sleek	1
spring	1
coats	1
they	1
basked	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
lowed	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
meadow	1
Levin	1
gazed	1
admiringly	1
at	1
the	1
cows	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
intimately	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
detail	1
of	1
their	1
condition	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
the	1
calves	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
into	1
the	1
paddock	1
The	1
herdsman	1
ran	1
gaily	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
meadow	1
The	1
cowherd	1
girls	1
picking	1
up	1
their	1
petticoats	1
ran	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
bare	1
legs	1
still	1
white	1
not	1
yet	1
brown	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
waving	1
brush	1
wood	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
chasing	1
the	1
calves	1
that	1
frolicked	1
in	1
the	1
mirth	1
of	1
spring	1
After	1
admiring	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
who	1
were	1
particularly	1
fine	1
the	1
early	1
calves	1
were	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
peasant	1
s	1
cow	1
and	1
Pava	1
s	1
daughter	1
at	1
three	1
months	1
old	1
was	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1
yearling	1
Levin	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
a	1
trough	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
out	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
in	1
the	1
paddock	1
But	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
paddock	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
used	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
the	1
hurdles	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
broken	1
He	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
carpenter	1
who	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
orders	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
But	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
the	1
carpenter	1
was	1
repairing	1
the	1
harrows	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
repaired	1
before	1
Lent	1
This	1
was	1
very	1
annoying	1
to	1
Levin	1
It	1
was	1
annoying	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
that	1
everlasting	1
slovenliness	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
work	1
against	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
striving	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
The	1
hurdles	1
as	1
he	1
ascertained	1
being	1
not	1
wanted	1
in	1
winter	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
horses	1
stable	1
and	1
there	1
broken	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
light	1
construction	1
only	1
meant	1
for	1
feeding	1
calves	1
Moreover	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
harrows	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
agricultural	1
implements	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
directed	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
over	1
and	1
repaired	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
for	1
which	1
very	1
purpose	1
he	1
had	1
hired	1
three	1
carpenters	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
put	1
into	1
repair	1
and	1
the	1
harrows	1
were	1
being	1
repaired	1
when	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
harrowing	1
the	1
field	1
Levin	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
bailiff	1
but	1
immediately	1
went	1
off	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
The	1
bailiff	1
beaming	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
everyone	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
sheepskin	1
bordered	1
with	1
astrachan	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
twisting	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
straw	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
Why	1
isn	1
t	1
the	1
carpenter	1
at	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
Oh	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
yesterday	1
the	1
harrows	1
want	1
repairing	1
Here	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
But	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
doing	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
then	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
want	1
the	1
carpenter	1
for	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
hurdles	1
for	1
the	1
calves	1
paddock	1
I	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
ready	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
with	1
those	1
peasants	1
said	1
the	1
bailiff	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
those	1
peasants	1
but	1
this	1
bailiff	1
said	1
Levin	1
getting	1
angry	1
Why	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
keep	1
you	1
for	1
he	1
cried	1
But	1
bethinking	1
himself	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
help	1
matters	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sentence	1
and	1
merely	1
sighed	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
Can	1
sowing	1
begin	1
he	1
asked	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
Behind	1
Turkin	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
might	1
begin	1
And	1
the	1
clover	1
I	1
ve	1
sent	1
Vassily	1
and	1
Mishka	1
they	1
re	1
sowing	1
Only	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
if	1
they	1
ll	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
slushy	1
How	1
many	1
acres	1
About	1
fifteen	1
Why	1
not	1
sow	1
all	1
cried	1
Levin	1
That	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
sowing	1
the	1
clover	1
on	1
fifteen	1
acres	1
not	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
forty	1
five	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
annoying	1
to	1
him	1
Clover	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
both	1
from	1
books	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
experience	1
never	1
did	1
well	1
except	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
sown	1
as	1
early	1
as	1
possible	1
almost	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
And	1
yet	1
Levin	1
could	1
never	1
get	1
this	1
done	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
send	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
peasants	1
Three	1
haven	1
t	1
turned	1
up	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
Semyon	1
Well	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
some	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
thatching	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
peasants	1
then	1
Five	1
are	1
making	1
comp^ote	1
which	1
meant	1
compost	1
four	1
are	1
shifting	1
the	1
oats	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
mildew	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Levin	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
mildew	1
meant	1
that	1
his	1
English	1
seed	1
oats	1
were	1
already	1
ruined	1
Again	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ordered	1
Why	1
but	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
during	1
Lent	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
pipes	1
he	1
cried	1
Don	1
t	1
put	1
yourself	1
out	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
done	1
in	1
time	1
Levin	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
angrily	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
granary	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
oats	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1
The	1
oats	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
spoiled	1
But	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
oats	1
in	1
spades	1
when	1
they	1
might	1
simply	1
let	1
them	1
slide	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
granary	1
and	1
arranging	1
for	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
taking	1
two	1
workmen	1
from	1
there	1
for	1
sowing	1
clover	1
Levin	1
got	1
over	1
his	1
vexation	1
with	1
the	1
bailiff	1
Indeed	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
lovely	1
day	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
Ignat	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
coachman	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
sleeves	1
tucked	1
up	1
was	1
washing	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
saddle	1
me	1
Which	1
sir	1
Well	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
Kolpik	1
Yes	1
sir	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
saddling	1
his	1
horse	1
Levin	1
again	1
called	1
up	1
the	1
bailiff	1
who	1
was	1
hanging	1
about	1
in	1
sight	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
spring	1
operations	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
his	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
farm	1
The	1
wagons	1
were	1
to	1
begin	1
carting	1
manure	1
earlier	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
done	1
before	1
the	1
early	1
mowing	1
And	1
the	1
ploughing	1
of	1
the	1
further	1
land	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
without	1
a	1
break	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
ripen	1
lying	1
fallow	1
And	1
the	1
mowing	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
done	1
by	1
hired	1
labor	1
not	1
on	1
half	1
profits	1
The	1
bailiff	1
listened	1
attentively	1
and	1
obviously	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
employer	1
s	1
projects	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
look	1
Levin	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
always	1
irritated	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
hopelessness	1
and	1
despondency	1
That	1
look	1
said	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
as	1
God	1
wills	1
Nothing	1
mortified	1
Levin	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
tone	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
tone	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
bailiffs	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
had	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
taken	1
up	1
that	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
plans	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
angered	1
by	1
it	1
but	1
mortified	1
and	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
roused	1
to	1
struggle	1
against	1
this	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
elemental	1
force	1
continually	1
ranged	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
other	1
expression	1
than	1
as	1
God	1
wills	1
If	1
we	1
can	1
manage	1
it	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
said	1
the	1
bailiff	1
Why	1
ever	1
shouldn	1
t	1
you	1
manage	1
it	1
We	1
positively	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
fifteen	1
laborers	1
And	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
turn	1
up	1
There	1
were	1
some	1
here	1
today	1
asking	1
seventy	1
roubles	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
Levin	1
was	1
silent	1
Again	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
that	1
opposing	1
force	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
they	1
tried	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hire	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
thirty	1
seven	1
perhaps	1
or	1
thirty	1
eight	1
laborers	1
for	1
a	1
reasonable	1
sum	1
Some	1
forty	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
on	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
struggling	1
against	1
it	1
Send	1
to	1
Sury	1
to	1
Tchefirovka	1
if	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
come	1
we	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
them	1
Oh	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
said	1
Vassily	1
Fedorovitch	1
despondently	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
horses	1
too	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
good	1
for	1
much	1
We	1
ll	1
get	1
some	1
more	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
Levin	1
added	1
laughing	1
you	1
always	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
as	1
little	1
and	1
as	1
poor	1
quality	1
as	1
possible	1
but	1
this	1
year	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
have	1
things	1
your	1
own	1
way	1
I	1
ll	1
see	1
to	1
everything	1
myself	1
Why	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
you	1
take	1
much	1
rest	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
It	1
cheers	1
us	1
up	1
to	1
work	1
under	1
the	1
master	1
s	1

So	1
they	1
re	1
sowing	1
clover	1
behind	1
the	1
Birch	1
Dale	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
getting	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
bay	1
cob	1
Kolpik	1
who	1
was	1
led	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
coachman	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
across	1
the	1
streams	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
the	1
coachman	1
shouted	1
All	1
right	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
forest	1
And	1
Levin	1
rode	1
through	1
the	1
slush	1
of	1
the	1
farmyard	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
his	1
good	1
little	1
horse	1
after	1
his	1
long	1
inactivity	1
stepping	1
out	1
gallantly	1
snorting	1
over	1
the	1
pools	1
and	1
asking	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
guidance	1
If	1
Levin	1
had	1
felt	1
happy	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
cattle	1
pens	1
and	1
farmyard	1
he	1
felt	1
happier	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
Swaying	1
rhythmically	1
with	1
the	1
ambling	1
paces	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
little	1
cob	1
drinking	1
in	1
the	1
warm	1
yet	1
fresh	1
scent	1
of	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
through	1
his	1
forest	1
over	1
the	1
crumbling	1
wasted	1
snow	1
still	1
left	1
in	1
parts	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
dissolving	1
tracks	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
every	1
tree	1
with	1
the	1
moss	1
reviving	1
on	1
its	1
bark	1
and	1
the	1
buds	1
swelling	1
on	1
its	1
shoots	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
plain	1
before	1
him	1
his	1
grass	1
fields	1
stretched	1
in	1
an	1
unbroken	1
carpet	1
of	1
green	1
without	1
one	1
bare	1
place	1
or	1
swamp	1
only	1
spotted	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
hollows	1
with	1
patches	1
of	1
melting	1
snow	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
horses	1
and	1
colts	1
trampling	1
down	1
his	1
young	1
grass	1
he	1
told	1
a	1
peasant	1
he	1
met	1
to	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
sarcastic	1
and	1
stupid	1
reply	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
Ipat	1
whom	1
he	1
met	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
asked	1
Well	1
Ipat	1
shall	1
we	1
soon	1
be	1
sowing	1
We	1
must	1
get	1
the	1
ploughing	1
done	1
first	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
answered	1
Ipat	1
The	1
further	1
he	1
rode	1
the	1
happier	1
he	1
became	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
each	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
plant	1
all	1
his	1
fields	1
with	1
hedges	1
along	1
the	1
southern	1
borders	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
snow	1
should	1
not	1
lie	1
under	1
them	1
to	1
divide	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
six	1
fields	1
of	1
arable	1
and	1
three	1
of	1
pasture	1
and	1
hay	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
cattle	1
yard	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
and	1
to	1
dig	1
a	1
pond	1
and	1
to	1
construct	1
movable	1
pens	1
for	1
the	1
cattle	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
manuring	1
the	1
land	1
And	1
then	1
eight	1
hundred	1
acres	1
of	1
wheat	1
three	1
hundred	1
of	1
potatoes	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
of	1
clover	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
acre	1
exhausted	1
Absorbed	1
in	1
such	1
dreams	1
carefully	1
keeping	1
his	1
horse	1
by	1
the	1
hedges	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
trample	1
his	1
young	1
crops	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
laborers	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
sow	1
clover	1
A	1
cart	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
standing	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
crop	1
and	1
the	1
winter	1
corn	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
trampled	1
by	1
the	1
horse	1
Both	1
the	1
laborers	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
probably	1
smoking	1
a	1
pipe	1
together	1
The	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
seed	1
was	1
mixed	1
was	1
not	1
crushed	1
to	1
powder	1
but	1
crusted	1
together	1
or	1
adhering	1
in	1
clods	1
Seeing	1
the	1
master	1
the	1
laborer	1
Vassily	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
cart	1
while	1
Mishka	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
sowing	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
laborers	1
Levin	1
seldom	1
lost	1
his	1
temper	1
When	1
Vassily	1
came	1
up	1
Levin	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
horse	1
to	1
the	1
hedge	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
sir	1
it	1
ll	1
spring	1
up	1
again	1
responded	1
Vassily	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
argue	1
said	1
Levin	1
but	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
told	1
Yes	1
sir	1
answered	1
Vassily	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
horse	1
s	1
head	1
What	1
a	1
sowing	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
he	1
said	1
hesitating	1
first	1
rate	1
Only	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
work	1
to	1
get	1
about	1
You	1
drag	1
a	1
ton	1
of	1
earth	1
on	1
your	1
shoes	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
earth	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
sifted	1
said	1
Levin	1
Well	1
we	1
crumble	1
it	1
up	1
answered	1
Vassily	1
taking	1
up	1
some	1
seed	1
and	1
rolling	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
his	1
palms	1
Vassily	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
their	1
having	1
filled	1
up	1
his	1
cart	1
with	1
unsifted	1
earth	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
annoying	1
Levin	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
already	1
tried	1
a	1
way	1
he	1
knew	1
for	1
stifling	1
his	1
anger	1
and	1
turning	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
dark	1
right	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
that	1
way	1
now	1
He	1
watched	1
how	1
Mishka	1
strode	1
along	1
swinging	1
the	1
huge	1
clods	1
of	1
earth	1
that	1
clung	1
to	1
each	1
foot	1
and	1
getting	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
sieve	1
from	1
Vassily	1
and	1
started	1
sowing	1
himself	1
Where	1
did	1
you	1
stop	1
Vassily	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
mark	1
with	1
his	1
foot	1
and	1
Levin	1
went	1
forward	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
scattering	1
the	1
seed	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
Walking	1
was	1
as	1
difficult	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
bog	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
Levin	1
had	1
ended	1
the	1
row	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
heat	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
sieve	1
to	1
Vassily	1
Well	1
master	1
when	1
summer	1
s	1
here	1
mind	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
scold	1
me	1
for	1
these	1
rows	1
said	1
Vassily	1
Eh	1
said	1
Levin	1
cheerily	1
already	1
feeling	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
his	1
method	1
Why	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
time	1
It	1
ll	1
look	1
different	1
Look	1
you	1
where	1
I	1
sowed	1
last	1
spring	1
How	1
I	1
did	1
work	1
at	1
it	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
best	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
d	1
ye	1
see	1
as	1
I	1
would	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
father	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
bad	1
work	1
myself	1
nor	1
would	1
I	1
let	1
another	1
man	1
do	1
it	1
What	1
s	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
master	1
s	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
too	1
To	1
look	1
out	1
yonder	1
now	1
said	1
Vassily	1
pointing	1
it	1
does	1
one	1
s	1
heart	1
good	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
lovely	1
spring	1
Vassily	1
Why	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
spring	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
the	1
like	1
of	1
I	1
was	1
up	1
home	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
up	1
there	1
has	1
sown	1
wheat	1
too	1
about	1
an	1
acre	1
of	1
it	1
He	1
was	1
saying	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
from	1
rye	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
sowing	1
wheat	1
long	1
Why	1
sir	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
taught	1
us	1
the	1
year	1
before	1
last	1
You	1
gave	1
me	1
two	1
measures	1
We	1
sold	1
about	1
eight	1
bushels	1
and	1
sowed	1
a	1
rood	1
Well	1
mind	1
you	1
crumble	1
up	1
the	1
clods	1
said	1
Levin	1
going	1
towards	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
Mishka	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
crop	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
half	1
a	1
rouble	1
for	1
every	1
acre	1
Humbly	1
thankful	1
We	1
are	1
very	1
well	1
content	1
sir	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
Levin	1
got	1
on	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
towards	1
the	1
field	1
where	1
was	1
last	1
year	1
s	1
clover	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
was	1
ploughed	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
spring	1
corn	1
The	1
crop	1
of	1
clover	1
coming	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
stubble	1
was	1
magnificent	1
It	1
had	1
survived	1
everything	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
vividly	1
green	1
through	1
the	1
broken	1
stalks	1
of	1
last	1
year	1
s	1
wheat	1
The	1
horse	1
sank	1
in	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
pasterns	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
each	1
hoof	1
with	1
a	1
sucking	1
sound	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
thawed	1
ground	1
Over	1
the	1
ploughland	1
riding	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
the	1
horse	1
could	1
only	1
keep	1
a	1
foothold	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
ice	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
thawing	1
furrows	1
he	1
sank	1
deep	1
in	1
at	1
each	1
step	1
The	1
ploughland	1
was	1
in	1
splendid	1
condition	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
fit	1
for	1
harrowing	1
and	1
sowing	1
Everything	1
was	1
capital	1
everything	1
was	1
cheering	1
Levin	1
rode	1
back	1
across	1
the	1
streams	1
hoping	1
the	1
water	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
down	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
get	1
across	1
and	1
startled	1
two	1
ducks	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
snipe	1
too	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
turning	1
homewards	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
forest	1
keeper	1
who	1
confirmed	1
his	1
theory	1
about	1
the	1
snipe	1
Levin	1
went	1
home	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
dinner	1
and	1
get	1
his	1
gun	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
evening	1
Chapter	1
14	1
As	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
Levin	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
ring	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
someone	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
he	1
thought	1
just	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
Moscow	1
train	1
Who	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
What	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
He	1
did	1
say	1
Maybe	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
waters	1
or	1
maybe	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
you	1
He	1
felt	1
dismayed	1
and	1
vexed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
presence	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
happy	1
mood	1
of	1
spring	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
opened	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
softened	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
expectation	1
now	1
he	1
hoped	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
brother	1
He	1
pricked	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
riding	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
acacias	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
hired	1
three	1
horse	1
sledge	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
a	1
fur	1
coat	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
Oh	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
some	1
nice	1
person	1
one	1
could	1
talk	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
thought	1
Ah	1
cried	1
Levin	1
joyfully	1
flinging	1
up	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
Here	1
s	1
a	1
delightful	1
visitor	1
Ah	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
shouted	1
recognizing	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
out	1
for	1
certain	1
whether	1
she	1
s	1
married	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
on	1
that	1
delicious	1
spring	1
day	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
did	1
not	1
hurt	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
Well	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
expect	1
me	1
eh	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sledge	1
splashed	1
with	1
mud	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose	1
on	1
his	1
cheek	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
but	1
radiant	1
with	1
health	1
and	1
good	1
spirits	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
said	1
embracing	1
and	1
kissing	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
stand	1
shooting	1
second	1
and	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
forest	1
at	1
Ergushovo	1
third	1
Delightful	1
What	1
a	1
spring	1
we	1
re	1
having	1
How	1
ever	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
along	1
in	1
a	1
sledge	1
In	1
a	1
cart	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
worse	1
still	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
answered	1
the	1
driver	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
genuine	1
smile	1
of	1
childlike	1
delight	1
Levin	1
led	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
visitors	1
where	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
things	1
were	1
carried	1
also	1
a	1
bag	1
a	1
gun	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
a	1
satchel	1
for	1
cigars	1
Leaving	1
him	1
there	1
to	1
wash	1
and	1
change	1
his	1
clothes	1
Levin	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
the	1
ploughing	1
and	1
clover	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
always	1
very	1
anxious	1
for	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
inquiries	1
about	1
dinner	1
Do	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
only	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bailiff	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
washed	1
and	1
combed	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
upstairs	1
together	1
Well	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
you	1
Now	1
I	1
shall	1
understand	1
what	1
the	1
mysterious	1
business	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
absorbed	1
in	1
here	1
No	1
really	1
I	1
envy	1
you	1
What	1
a	1
house	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
So	1
bright	1
so	1
cheerful	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
forgetting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
spring	1
and	1
fine	1
weather	1
like	1
that	1
day	1
And	1
your	1
nurse	1
is	1
simply	1
charming	1
A	1
pretty	1
maid	1
in	1
an	1
apron	1
might	1
be	1
even	1
more	1
agreeable	1
perhaps	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
severe	1
monastic	1
style	1
it	1
does	1
very	1
well	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
told	1
him	1
many	1
interesting	1
pieces	1
of	1
news	1
especially	1
interesting	1
to	1
Levin	1
was	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
intending	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
Not	1
one	1
word	1
did	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
say	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
Kitty	1
and	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
he	1
merely	1
gave	1
him	1
greetings	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
Levin	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
delicacy	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
his	1
visitor	1
As	1
always	1
happened	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
his	1
solitude	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
ideas	1
and	1
feelings	1
had	1
been	1
accumulating	1
within	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
communicate	1
to	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
his	1
poetic	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
his	1
failures	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
criticisms	1
on	1
the	1
books	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
reading	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
book	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
which	1
really	1
was	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
unaware	1
of	1
it	1
himself	1
a	1
criticism	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
books	1
on	1
agriculture	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
always	1
charming	1
understanding	1
everything	1
at	1
the	1
slightest	1
reference	1
was	1
particularly	1
charming	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
and	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
special	1
tenderness	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
tone	1
of	1
respect	1
that	1
flattered	1
him	1
The	1
efforts	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
and	1
the	1
cook	1
that	1
the	1
dinner	1
should	1
be	1
particularly	1
good	1
only	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
famished	1
friends	1
attacking	1
the	1
preliminary	1
course	1
eating	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
salt	1
goose	1
and	1
salted	1
mushrooms	1
and	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
finally	1
ordering	1
the	1
soup	1
to	1
be	1
served	1
without	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
little	1
pies	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
cook	1
had	1
particularly	1
meant	1
to	1
impress	1
their	1
visitor	1
But	1
though	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
very	1
different	1
dinners	1
he	1
thought	1
everything	1
excellent	1
the	1
herb	1
brandy	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
the	1
butter	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
salt	1
goose	1
and	1
the	1
mushrooms	1
and	1
the	1
nettle	1
soup	1
and	1
the	1
chicken	1
in	1
white	1
sauce	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
Crimean	1
wine	1
everything	1
was	1
superb	1
and	1
delicious	1
Splendid	1
splendid	1
he	1
said	1
lighting	1
a	1
fat	1
cigar	1
after	1
the	1
roast	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
had	1
landed	1
on	1
a	1
peaceful	1
shore	1
after	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
jolting	1
of	1
a	1
steamer	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
maintain	1
that	1
the	1
laborer	1
himself	1
is	1
an	1
element	1
to	1
be	1
studied	1
and	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
methods	1
in	1
agriculture	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
m	1
an	1
ignorant	1
outsider	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
fancy	1
theory	1
and	1
its	1
application	1
will	1
have	1
its	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
laborer	1
too	1
Yes	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
talking	1
of	1
political	1
economy	1
I	1
m	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
agriculture	1
It	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
and	1
to	1
observe	1
given	1
phenomena	1
and	1
the	1
laborer	1
in	1
his	1
economic	1
ethnographical	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
jam	1
Oh	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
kissing	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
plump	1
fingers	1
what	1
salt	1
goose	1
what	1
herb	1
brandy	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
start	1
Kostya	1
he	1
added	1
Levin	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
sinking	1
behind	1
the	1
bare	1
tree	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
Kouzma	1
get	1
ready	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
going	1
down	1
carefully	1
took	1
the	1
canvas	1
cover	1
off	1
his	1
varnished	1
gun	1
case	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
opening	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
his	1
expensive	1
new	1
fashioned	1
gun	1
Kouzma	1
who	1
already	1
scented	1
a	1
big	1
tip	1
never	1
left	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
both	1
his	1
stockings	1
and	1
boots	1
a	1
task	1
which	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
readily	1
left	1
him	1
Kostya	1
give	1
orders	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
merchant	1
Ryabinin	1
comes	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
today	1
he	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
and	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
me	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
re	1
selling	1
the	1
forest	1
to	1
Ryabinin	1
Yes	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
him	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
business	1
with	1
him	1
positively	1
and	1
conclusively	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughed	1
Positively	1
and	1
conclusively	1
were	1
the	1
merchant	1
s	1
favorite	1
words	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
wonderfully	1
funny	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
talks	1
She	1
knows	1
where	1
her	1
master	1
s	1
going	1
he	1
added	1
patting	1
Laska	1
who	1
hung	1
about	1
Levin	1
whining	1
and	1
licking	1
his	1
hands	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
his	1
gun	1
The	1
trap	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
I	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
trap	1
round	1
or	1
would	1
you	1
rather	1
walk	1
No	1
we	1
d	1
better	1
drive	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
tucked	1
the	1
tiger	1
skin	1
rug	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
lighted	1
a	1
cigar	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
smoke	1
A	1
cigar	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
not	1
exactly	1
a	1
pleasure	1
but	1
the	1
crown	1
and	1
outward	1
sign	1
of	1
pleasure	1
Come	1
this	1
is	1
life	1
How	1
splendid	1
it	1
is	1
This	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
live	1
Why	1
who	1
prevents	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
smiling	1
No	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
lucky	1
man	1
You	1
ve	1
got	1
everything	1
you	1
like	1
You	1
like	1
horses	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
them	1
dogs	1
you	1
have	1
them	1
shooting	1
you	1
have	1
it	1
farming	1
you	1
have	1
it	1
Perhaps	1
because	1
I	1
rejoice	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
fret	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
said	1
Levin	1
thinking	1
of	1
Kitty	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
comprehended	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
Levin	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
for	1
noticing	1
with	1
his	1
never	1
failing	1
tact	1
that	1
he	1
dreaded	1
conversation	1
about	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
nothing	1
about	1
them	1
But	1
now	1
Levin	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
tormenting	1
him	1
so	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
begin	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
things	1
are	1
going	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
bethinking	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
nice	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
himself	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
merrily	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
admit	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
new	1
rolls	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
had	1
one	1
s	1
rations	1
of	1
bread	1
to	1
your	1
mind	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
crime	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
count	1
life	1
as	1
life	1
without	1
love	1
he	1
said	1
taking	1
Levin	1
s	1
question	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
I	1
m	1
made	1
that	1
way	1
And	1
really	1
one	1
does	1
so	1
little	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
gives	1
oneself	1
so	1
much	1
pleasure	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
something	1
new	1
then	1
queried	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
my	1
boy	1
there	1
is	1
There	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
type	1
of	1
Ossian	1
s	1
women	1
Women	1
such	1
as	1
one	1
sees	1
in	1
dreams	1
Well	1
these	1
women	1
are	1
sometimes	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
in	1
reality	1
and	1
these	1
women	1
are	1
terrible	1
Woman	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
you	1
study	1
it	1
it	1
s	1
always	1
perfectly	1
new	1
Well	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
study	1
it	1
No	1
Some	1
mathematician	1
has	1
said	1
that	1
enjoyment	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
search	1
for	1
truth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
finding	1
it	1
Levin	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
efforts	1
he	1
made	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
understand	1
his	1
sentiments	1
and	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
studying	1
such	1
women	1

The	1
place	1
fixed	1
on	1
for	1
the	1
stand	1
shooting	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
above	1
a	1
stream	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
aspen	1
copse	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
copse	1
Levin	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
led	1
Oblonsky	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
mossy	1
swampy	1
glade	1
already	1
quite	1
free	1
from	1
snow	1
He	1
went	1
back	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
double	1
birch	1
tree	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
gun	1
on	1
the	1
fork	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
lower	1
branch	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
full	1
overcoat	1
fastened	1
his	1
belt	1
again	1
and	1
worked	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
free	1
Gray	1
old	1
Laska	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
them	1
sat	1
down	1
warily	1
opposite	1
him	1
and	1
pricked	1
up	1
her	1
ears	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
setting	1
behind	1
a	1
thick	1
forest	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
sunset	1
the	1
birch	1
trees	1
dotted	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
aspen	1
copse	1
stood	1
out	1
clearly	1
with	1
their	1
hanging	1
twigs	1
and	1
their	1
buds	1
swollen	1
almost	1
to	1
bursting	1
From	1
the	1
thickest	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
copse	1
where	1
the	1
snow	1
still	1
remained	1
came	1
the	1
faint	1
sound	1
of	1
narrow	1
winding	1
threads	1
of	1
water	1
running	1
away	1
Tiny	1
birds	1
twittered	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
fluttered	1
from	1
tree	1
to	1
tree	1
In	1
the	1
pauses	1
of	1
complete	1
stillness	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
last	1
year	1
s	1
leaves	1
stirred	1
by	1
the	1
thawing	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
Imagine	1
One	1
can	1
hear	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
grass	1
growing	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
noticing	1
a	1
wet	1
slate	1
colored	1
aspen	1
leaf	1
moving	1
beside	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
young	1
grass	1
He	1
stood	1
listened	1
and	1
gazed	1
sometimes	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
wet	1
mossy	1
ground	1
sometimes	1
at	1
Laska	1
listening	1
all	1
alert	1
sometimes	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
bare	1
tree	1
tops	1
that	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
below	1
him	1
sometimes	1
at	1
the	1
darkening	1
sky	1
covered	1
with	1
white	1
streaks	1
of	1
cloud	1
A	1
hawk	1
flew	1
high	1
over	1
a	1
forest	1
far	1
away	1
with	1
slow	1
sweep	1
of	1
its	1
wings	1
another	1
flew	1
with	1
exactly	1
the	1

motion	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
and	1
vanished	1
The	1
birds	1
twittered	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
loudly	1
and	1
busily	1
in	1
the	1
thicket	1
An	1
owl	1
hooted	1
not	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
Laska	1
starting	1
stepped	1
cautiously	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
began	1
to	1
listen	1
intently	1
Beyond	1
the	1
stream	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
cuckoo	1
Twice	1
she	1
uttered	1
her	1
usual	1
cuckoo	1
call	1
and	1
then	1
gave	1
a	1
hoarse	1
hurried	1
call	1
and	1
broke	1
down	1
Imagine	1
the	1
cuckoo	1
already	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
coming	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
bush	1
Yes	1
I	1
hear	1
it	1
answered	1
Levin	1
reluctantly	1
breaking	1
the	1
stillness	1
with	1
his	1
voice	1
which	1
sounded	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
himself	1
Now	1
it	1
s	1
coming	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
figure	1
again	1
went	1
behind	1
the	1
bush	1
and	1
Levin	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
bright	1
flash	1
of	1
a	1
match	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
red	1
glow	1
and	1
blue	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
cigarette	1
Tchk	1
tchk	1
came	1
the	1
snapping	1
sound	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
cocking	1
his	1
gun	1
What	1
s	1
that	1
cry	1
asked	1
Oblonsky	1
drawing	1
Levin	1
s	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
prolonged	1
cry	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
colt	1
were	1
whinnying	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
voice	1
in	1
play	1
Oh	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
hare	1
But	1
enough	1
talking	1
Listen	1
it	1
s	1
flying	1
almost	1
shrieked	1
Levin	1
cocking	1
his	1
gun	1
They	1
heard	1
a	1
shrill	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
exact	1
time	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
sportsman	1
two	1
seconds	1
later	1
another	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
third	1
whistle	1
the	1
hoarse	1
guttural	1
cry	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
Levin	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
there	1
just	1
facing	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
dusky	1
blue	1
sky	1
above	1
the	1
confused	1
mass	1
of	1
tender	1
shoots	1
of	1
the	1
aspens	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
flying	1
bird	1
It	1
was	1
flying	1
straight	1
towards	1
him	1
the	1
guttural	1
cry	1
like	1
the	1
even	1
tearing	1
of	1
some	1
strong	1
stuff	1
sounded	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
ear	1
the	1
long	1
beak	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
Levin	1
was	1
taking	1
aim	1
behind	1
the	1
bush	1
where	1
Oblonsky	1
stood	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
red	1
lightning	1
the	1
bird	1
dropped	1
like	1
an	1
arrow	1
and	1
darted	1
upwards	1
again	1
Again	1
came	1
the	1
red	1
flash	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
blow	1
and	1
fluttering	1
its	1
wings	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
the	1
bird	1
halted	1
stopped	1
still	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
fell	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
splash	1
on	1
the	1
slushy	1
ground	1
Can	1
I	1
have	1
missed	1
it	1
shouted	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
smoke	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
Levin	1
pointing	1
to	1
Laska	1
who	1
with	1
one	1
ear	1
raised	1
wagging	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
shaggy	1
tail	1
came	1
slowly	1
back	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
prolong	1
the	1
pleasure	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
smiling	1
brought	1
the	1
dead	1
bird	1
to	1
her	1
master	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
you	1
were	1
successful	1
said	1
Levin	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
envy	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
shooting	1
the	1
snipe	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
shot	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
barrel	1
responded	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
loading	1
his	1
gun	1
Sh	1
it	1
s	1
flying	1
The	1
shrill	1
whistles	1
rapidly	1
following	1
one	1
another	1
were	1
heard	1
again	1
Two	1
snipe	1
playing	1
and	1
chasing	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
only	1
whistling	1
not	1
crying	1
flew	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
four	1
shots	1
and	1
like	1
swallows	1
the	1
snipe	1
turned	1
swift	1
somersaults	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
vanished	1
from	1
sight	1
The	1
stand	1
shooting	1
was	1
capital	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
shot	1
two	1
more	1
birds	1
and	1
Levin	1
two	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
It	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
dark	1
Venus	1
bright	1
and	1
silvery	1
shone	1
with	1
her	1
soft	1
light	1
low	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
behind	1
the	1
birch	1
trees	1
and	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
east	1
twinkled	1
the	1
red	1
lights	1
of	1
Arcturus	1
Over	1
his	1
head	1
Levin	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Bear	1
and	1
lost	1
them	1
again	1
The	1
snipe	1
had	1
ceased	1
flying	1
but	1
Levin	1
resolved	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
till	1
Venus	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
below	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
birch	1
should	1
be	1
above	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Bear	1
should	1
be	1
perfectly	1
plain	1
Venus	1
had	1
risen	1
above	1
the	1
branch	1
and	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Bear	1
with	1
its	1
shaft	1
was	1
now	1
all	1
plainly	1
visible	1
against	1
the	1
dark	1
blue	1
sky	1
yet	1
still	1
he	1
waited	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
still	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
copse	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
bird	1
was	1
stirring	1
Let	1
s	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
answered	1
Levin	1
As	1
you	1
like	1
They	1
were	1
standing	1
now	1
about	1
fifteen	1
paces	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
Stiva	1
said	1
Levin	1
unexpectedly	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
tell	1
me	1
whether	1
your	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
s	1
married	1
yet	1
or	1
when	1
she	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
Levin	1
felt	1
so	1
resolute	1
and	1
serene	1
that	1
no	1
answer	1
he	1
fancied	1
could	1
affect	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1
what	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
replied	1
She	1
s	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
married	1
and	1
isn	1
t	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
s	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
the	1
doctors	1
have	1
sent	1
her	1
abroad	1
They	1
re	1
positively	1
afraid	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
live	1
What	1
cried	1
Levin	1
Very	1
ill	1
What	1
is	1
wrong	1
with	1
her	1
How	1
has	1
she	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
this	1
Laska	1
with	1
ears	1
pricked	1
up	1
was	1
looking	1
upwards	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
them	1
They	1
have	1
chosen	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
talk	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
It	1
s	1
on	1
the	1
wing	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
yes	1
it	1
is	1
They	1
ll	1
miss	1
it	1
thought	1
Laska	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
instant	1
both	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
shrill	1
whistle	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
smote	1
on	1
their	1
ears	1
and	1
both	1
suddenly	1
seized	1
their	1
guns	1
and	1
two	1
flashes	1
gleamed	1
and	1
two	1
bangs	1
sounded	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
instant	1
The	1
snipe	1
flying	1
high	1
above	1
instantly	1
folded	1
its	1
wings	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
thicket	1
bending	1
down	1
the	1
delicate	1
shoots	1
Splendid	1
Together	1
cried	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
with	1
Laska	1
into	1
the	1
thicket	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
snipe	1
Oh	1
yes	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
he	1
wondered	1
Yes	1
Kitty	1
s	1
ill	1
Well	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
sorry	1
he	1
thought	1
She	1
s	1
found	1
it	1
Isn	1
t	1
she	1
a	1
clever	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
taking	1
the	1
warm	1
bird	1
from	1
Laska	1
s	1
mouth	1
and	1
packing	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
almost	1
full	1
game	1
bag	1
I	1
ve	1
got	1
it	1
Stiva	1
he	1
shouted	1
Chapter	1
16	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
Levin	1
asked	1
all	1
details	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
plans	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
ashamed	1
to	1
admit	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
heard	1
He	1
was	1
pleased	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
hope	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
pleased	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
suffering	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
suffer	1
so	1
much	1
But	1
when	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
mentioned	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
name	1
Levin	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
whatever	1
to	1
know	1
family	1
matters	1
and	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1
either	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
hardly	1
perceptibly	1
catching	1
the	1
instantaneous	1
change	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
as	1
gloomy	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
bright	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
Have	1
you	1
quite	1
settled	1
about	1
the	1
forest	1
with	1
Ryabinin	1
asked	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
settled	1
The	1
price	1
is	1
magnificent	1
thirty	1
eight	1
thousand	1
Eight	1
straight	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
six	1
years	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
bothering	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
so	1
long	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
give	1
more	1
Then	1
you	1
ve	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
given	1
away	1
your	1
forest	1
for	1
nothing	1
said	1
Levin	1
gloomily	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
for	1
nothing	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
knowing	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
eyes	1
now	1
Because	1
the	1
forest	1
is	1
worth	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
roubles	1
the	1
acre	1
answered	1
Levin	1
Oh	1
these	1
farmers	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
playfully	1
Your	1
tone	1
of	1
contempt	1
for	1
us	1
poor	1
townsfolk	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
business	1
we	1
do	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
anyone	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
reckoned	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
forest	1
is	1
fetching	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
price	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
of	1
this	1
fellow	1
s	1
crying	1
off	1
in	1
fact	1
You	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
timber	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
hoping	1
by	1
this	1
distinction	1
to	1
convince	1
Levin	1
completely	1
of	1
the	1
unfairness	1
of	1
his	1
doubts	1
And	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
run	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
five	1
yards	1
of	1
fagots	1
per	1
acre	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
giving	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
seventy	1
roubles	1
the	1
acre	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
fashion	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
city	1
people	1
who	1
after	1
being	1
twice	1
in	1
ten	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
pick	1
up	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
phrases	1
and	1
use	1
them	1
in	1
season	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
season	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
Timber	1
run	1
to	1
so	1
many	1
yards	1
the	1
acre	1
	1
He	1
says	1
those	1
words	1
without	1
understanding	1
them	1
himself	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
attempt	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
what	1
you	1
write	1
about	1
in	1
your	1
office	1
said	1
he	1
and	1
if	1
need	1
arose	1
I	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
you	1
re	1
so	1
positive	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
lore	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
It	1
s	1
difficult	1
Have	1
you	1
counted	1
the	1
trees	1
How	1
count	1
the	1
trees	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
still	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
friend	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
ill	1
temper	1
Count	1
the	1
sands	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
number	1
the	1
stars	1
Some	1
higher	1
power	1
might	1
do	1
it	1
Oh	1
well	1
the	1
higher	1
power	1
of	1
Ryabinin	1
can	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
merchant	1
ever	1
buys	1
a	1
forest	1
without	1
counting	1
the	1
trees	1
unless	1
they	1
get	1
it	1
given	1
them	1
for	1
nothing	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
doing	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
forest	1
I	1
go	1
there	1
every	1
year	1
shooting	1
and	1
your	1
forest	1
s	1
worth	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
roubles	1
an	1
acre	1
paid	1
down	1
while	1
he	1
s	1
giving	1
you	1
sixty	1
by	1
installments	1
So	1
that	1
in	1
fact	1
you	1
re	1
making	1
him	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
Come	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
your	1
imagination	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
piteously	1
Why	1
was	1
it	1
none	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
then	1
Why	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
an	1
understanding	1
with	1
the	1
merchants	1
he	1
s	1
bought	1
them	1
off	1
I	1
ve	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
all	1

He	1
wouldn	1
t	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
bargain	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
ten	1
fifteen	1
per	1
cent	1
profit	1
but	1
holds	1
back	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
rouble	1
s	1
worth	1
for	1
twenty	1
kopecks	1
Well	1
enough	1
of	1
it	1
You	1
re	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
Not	1
the	1
least	1
said	1
Levin	1
gloomily	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
At	1
the	1
steps	1
there	1
stood	1
a	1
trap	1
tightly	1
covered	1
with	1
iron	1
and	1
leather	1
with	1
a	1
sleek	1
horse	1
tightly	1
harnessed	1
with	1
broad	1
collar	1
straps	1
In	1
the	1
trap	1
sat	1
the	1
chubby	1
tightly	1
belted	1
clerk	1
who	1
served	1
Ryabinin	1
as	1
coachman	1
Ryabinin	1
himself	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
met	1
the	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
Ryabinin	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
thinnish	1
middle	1
aged	1
man	1
with	1
mustache	1
and	1
a	1
projecting	1
clean	1
shaven	1
chin	1
and	1
prominent	1
muddy	1
looking	1
eyes	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
skirted	1
blue	1
coat	1
with	1
buttons	1
below	1
the	1
waist	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
wore	1
high	1
boots	1
wrinkled	1
over	1
the	1
ankles	1
and	1
straight	1
over	1
the	1
calf	1
with	1
big	1
galoshes	1
drawn	1
over	1
them	1
He	1
rubbed	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
wrapping	1
round	1
him	1
his	1
coat	1
which	1
sat	1
extremely	1
well	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
greeted	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
catch	1
something	1
So	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
giving	1
him	1
his	1
hand	1
That	1
s	1
capital	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
disregard	1
your	1
excellency	1
s	1
commands	1
though	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
extremely	1
bad	1
I	1
positively	1
walked	1
the	1
whole	1
way	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
here	1
at	1
my	1
time	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
my	1
respects	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Levin	1
trying	1
to	1
seize	1
his	1
hand	1
too	1
But	1
Levin	1
scowling	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
snipe	1
Your	1
honors	1
have	1
been	1
diverting	1
yourselves	1
with	1
the	1
chase	1
What	1
kind	1
of	1
bird	1
may	1
it	1
be	1
pray	1
added	1
Ryabinin	1
looking	1
contemptuously	1
at	1
the	1
snipe	1
a	1
great	1
delicacy	1
I	1
suppose	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
grave	1
doubts	1
whether	1
this	1
game	1
were	1
worth	1
the	1
candle	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
my	1
study	1
Levin	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
scowling	1
morosely	1
Go	1
into	1
my	1
study	1
you	1
can	1
talk	1
there	1
Quite	1
so	1
where	1
you	1
please	1
said	1
Ryabinin	1
with	1
contemptuous	1
dignity	1
as	1
though	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
felt	1
that	1
others	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
difficulties	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
difficulty	1
about	1
anything	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
study	1
Ryabinin	1
looked	1
about	1
as	1
his	1
habit	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cross	1
himself	1
He	1
scanned	1
the	1
bookcases	1
and	1
bookshelves	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
dubious	1
air	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
the	1
snipe	1
he	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
willing	1
to	1
allow	1
that	1
this	1
game	1
were	1
worth	1
the	1
candle	1
Well	1
have	1
you	1
brought	1
the	1
money	1
asked	1
Oblonsky	1
Sit	1
down	1
Oh	1
don	1
t	1
trouble	1
about	1
the	1
money	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
But	1
do	1
sit	1
down	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
said	1
Ryabinin	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
intensest	1
discomfort	1
to	1
himself	1
You	1
must	1
knock	1
it	1
down	1
a	1
bit	1
prince	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
bad	1
The	1
money	1
is	1
ready	1
conclusively	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
farthing	1
As	1
to	1
paying	1
the	1
money	1
down	1
there	1
ll	1
be	1
no	1

Levin	1
who	1
had	1
meanwhile	1
been	1
putting	1
his	1
gun	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
cupboard	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
catching	1
the	1
merchant	1
s	1
words	1
he	1
stopped	1
Why	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
the	1
forest	1
for	1
nothing	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
too	1
late	1
or	1
I	1
d	1
have	1
fixed	1
the	1
price	1
for	1
him	1
Ryabinin	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
looked	1
Levin	1
down	1
and	1
up	1
Very	1
close	1
about	1

Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
turning	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
there	1
s	1
positively	1
no	1
dealing	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
was	1
bargaining	1
for	1
some	1
wheat	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
pretty	1
price	1
I	1
offered	1
too	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
goods	1
for	1
nothing	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
pick	1
it	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
nor	1
steal	1
it	1
either	1
Mercy	1
on	1
us	1
nowadays	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
chance	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
stealing	1
With	1
the	1

courts	1
and	1
everything	1
done	1
in	1
style	1
nowadays	1
there	1
s	1
no	1

of	1

We	1
are	1

over	1

His	1
excellency	1

asking	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
forest	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
make	1
both	1
ends	1
meet	1
over	1
it	1
I	1
must	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
concession	1
But	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
settled	1
between	1
you	1
or	1
not	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
settled	1
it	1
s	1
useless	1

but	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
said	1
Levin	1
I	1
ll	1
buy	1
the	1
forest	1
The	1
smile	1
vanished	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
Ryabinin	1
s	1
face	1
A	1
hawklike	1
greedy	1
cruel	1
expression	1
was	1
left	1
upon	1
it	1
With	1
rapid	1
bony	1
fingers	1
he	1
unbuttoned	1
his	1
coat	1
revealing	1
a	1
shirt	1
bronze	1
waistcoat	1
buttons	1
and	1
a	1
watch	1
chain	1
and	1
quickly	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
fat	1
old	1
pocketbook	1
Here	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
forest	1
is	1
mine	1
he	1
said	1
crossing	1
himself	1
quickly	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
Take	1
the	1
money	1
it	1
s	1
my	1
forest	1
That	1

of	1
doing	1
business	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
haggle	1
over	1
every	1
half	1
penny	1
he	1
added	1
scowling	1
and	1
waving	1
the	1
pocketbook	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
Come	1
really	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
in	1
surprise	1
I	1
ve	1
given	1
my	1
word	1
you	1
know	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
slamming	1
the	1
door	1
Ryabinin	1
looked	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
youthfulness	1
positively	1
nothing	1
but	1
boyishness	1
Why	1
I	1
m	1
buying	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
honor	1
simply	1
believe	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
Ryabinin	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
should	1
have	1
bought	1
the	1
copse	1
of	1
Oblonsky	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
profits	1
why	1
I	1
must	1
make	1
what	1
God	1
gives	1
In	1
God	1
s	1
name	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
kindly	1
sign	1
the	1
title	1
deed	1
Within	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
merchant	1
stroking	1
his	1
big	1
overcoat	1
neatly	1
down	1
and	1
hooking	1
up	1
his	1
jacket	1
with	1
the	1
agreement	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
tightly	1
covered	1
trap	1
and	1
drove	1
homewards	1
Ugh	1
these	1
gentlefolks	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
clerk	1
They	1
they	1
re	1
a	1
nice	1
lot	1
That	1
s	1
so	1
responded	1
the	1
clerk	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
buttoning	1
the	1
leather	1
apron	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
congratulate	1
you	1
on	1
the	1

Chapter	1
17	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
upstairs	1
with	1
his	1
pocket	1
bulging	1
with	1
notes	1
which	1
the	1
merchant	1
had	1
paid	1
him	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
advance	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
their	1
shooting	1
had	1
been	1
excellent	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
felt	1
specially	1
anxious	1
to	1
dissipate	1
the	1
ill	1
humor	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
Levin	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
day	1
at	1
supper	1
as	1
pleasantly	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
Levin	1
certainly	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
affectionate	1
and	1
cordial	1
to	1
his	1
charming	1
visitor	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
his	1
mood	1
The	1
intoxication	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
not	1
married	1
had	1
gradually	1
begun	1
to	1
work	1
upon	1
him	1
Kitty	1
was	1
not	1
married	1
but	1
ill	1
and	1
ill	1
from	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
slighted	1
her	1
This	1
slight	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
rebounded	1
upon	1
him	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
slighted	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
slighted	1
him	1
Levin	1
Consequently	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
despise	1
Levin	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
his	1
enemy	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
out	1
He	1
vaguely	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
insulting	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
now	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
disturbed	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
fell	1
foul	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
The	1
stupid	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
the	1
fraud	1
practiced	1
upon	1
Oblonsky	1
and	1
concluded	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
exasperated	1
him	1
Well	1
finished	1
he	1
said	1
meeting	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
upstairs	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
supper	1
Well	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
say	1
no	1
to	1
it	1
What	1
an	1
appetite	1
I	1
get	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Wonderful	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
offer	1
Ryabinin	1
something	1
Oh	1
damn	1
him	1
Still	1
how	1
you	1
do	1
treat	1
him	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
even	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
Why	1
not	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
Because	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
waiter	1
and	1
a	1
waiter	1
s	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
is	1
What	1
a	1
reactionist	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
What	1
about	1
the	1
amalgamation	1
of	1
classes	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
Anyone	1
who	1
likes	1
amalgamating	1
is	1
welcome	1
to	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
sickens	1
me	1
You	1
re	1
a	1
regular	1
reactionist	1
I	1
see	1
Really	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
considered	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
am	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
and	1
nothing	1
else	1
And	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
very	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
I	1
am	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
Because	1
excuse	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
stupid	1
sale	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
frowned	1
good	1
humoredly	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
feels	1
himself	1
teased	1
and	1
attacked	1
for	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
Come	1
enough	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
When	1
did	1
anybody	1
ever	1
sell	1
anything	1
without	1
being	1
told	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
sale	1
It	1
was	1
worth	1
much	1
more	1
But	1
when	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
sell	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
give	1
anything	1
No	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
ve	1
a	1
grudge	1
against	1
that	1
unlucky	1
Ryabinin	1
Maybe	1
I	1
have	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
You	1
ll	1
say	1
again	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
reactionist	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
terrible	1
word	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
does	1
annoy	1
and	1
anger	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
the	1
impoverishing	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
belong	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
amalgamation	1
of	1
classes	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
belong	1
And	1
their	1
impoverishment	1
is	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
extravagance	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
living	1
in	1
good	1
style	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
proper	1
thing	1
for	1
noblemen	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
the	1
nobles	1
who	1
know	1
how	1

Now	1
the	1
peasants	1
about	1
us	1
buy	1
land	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
that	1
The	1
gentleman	1
does	1
nothing	1
while	1
the	1
peasant	1
works	1
and	1
supplants	1
the	1
idle	1
man	1
That	1
s	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
for	1
the	1
peasant	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
mind	1
seeing	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
impoverishment	1
from	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
innocence	1
Here	1
a	1
Polish	1
speculator	1
bought	1
for	1
half	1
its	1
value	1
a	1
magnificent	1
estate	1
from	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
Nice	1
And	1
there	1
a	1
merchant	1
will	1
get	1
three	1
acres	1
of	1
land	1
worth	1
ten	1
roubles	1
as	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
loan	1
of	1
one	1
rouble	1
Here	1
for	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
reason	1
you	1
ve	1
made	1
that	1
rascal	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
Well	1
what	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
Counted	1
every	1
tree	1
Of	1
course	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
counted	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
count	1
them	1
but	1
Ryabinin	1
did	1
Ryabinin	1
s	1
children	1
will	1
have	1
means	1
of	1
livelihood	1
and	1
education	1
while	1
yours	1
maybe	1
will	1
not	1
Well	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
mean	1
in	1
this	1
counting	1
We	1
have	1
our	1
business	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
theirs	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
make	1
their	1
profit	1
Anyway	1
the	1
thing	1
s	1
done	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
here	1
come	1
some	1
poached	1
eggs	1
my	1
favorite	1
dish	1
And	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
that	1
marvelous	1
herb	1
brandy	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
began	1
joking	1
with	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
tasted	1
such	1
a	1
dinner	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
supper	1
Well	1
you	1
do	1
praise	1
it	1
anyway	1
said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
but	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
give	1
him	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
a	1
crust	1
of	1
bread	1
he	1
ll	1
eat	1
it	1
and	1
walk	1
away	1
Though	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
gloomy	1
and	1
silent	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
put	1
one	1
question	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
words	1
or	1
the	1
moment	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
undressed	1
again	1
washed	1
and	1
attired	1
in	1
a	1
nightshirt	1
with	1
goffered	1
frills	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
bed	1
but	1
Levin	1
still	1
lingered	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
talking	1
of	1
various	1
trifling	1
matters	1
and	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
How	1
wonderfully	1
they	1
make	1
this	1
soap	1
he	1
said	1
gazing	1
at	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
soap	1
he	1
was	1
handling	1
which	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
had	1
put	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
visitor	1
but	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
not	1
used	1
Only	1
look	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
art	1
Yes	1
everything	1
s	1
brought	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
perfection	1
nowadays	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
moist	1
and	1
blissful	1
yawn	1
The	1
theater	1
for	1

and	1
the	1
entertainments	1

yawned	1
The	1

Yes	1
the	1

said	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
Oh	1
and	1
where	1
s	1
Vronsky	1
now	1
he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
soap	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
checking	1
his	1
yawn	1
he	1
s	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
He	1
left	1
soon	1
after	1
you	1
did	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
Moscow	1
since	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
Kostya	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
propping	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
his	1
handsome	1
ruddy	1
face	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
moist	1
good	1
natured	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
shone	1
like	1
stars	1
It	1
s	1
your	1
own	1
fault	1
You	1
took	1
fright	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
rival	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
say	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
better	1
chance	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
fight	1
it	1
out	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
He	1
yawned	1
inwardly	1
without	1
opening	1
his	1
mouth	1
Does	1
he	1
know	1
or	1
doesn	1
t	1
he	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
Levin	1
wondered	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
humbugging	1
diplomatic	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
feeling	1
he	1
was	1
blushing	1
he	1
looked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
without	1
speaking	1
If	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
superficial	1
attraction	1
pursued	1
Oblonsky	1
His	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
perfect	1
aristocrat	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
his	1
future	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
had	1
an	1
influence	1
not	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
Levin	1
scowled	1
The	1
humiliation	1
of	1
his	1
rejection	1
stung	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
fresh	1
wound	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
received	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
home	1
are	1
a	1
support	1
Stay	1
stay	1
he	1
began	1
interrupting	1
Oblonsky	1
You	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
an	1
aristocrat	1
But	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
it	1
consists	1
in	1
that	1
aristocracy	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
or	1
of	1
anybody	1
else	1
beside	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
You	1
consider	1
Vronsky	1
an	1
aristocrat	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
A	1
man	1
whose	1
father	1
crawled	1
up	1
from	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
intrigue	1
and	1
whose	1
mother	1
God	1
knows	1
whom	1
she	1
wasn	1
t	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
No	1
excuse	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
aristocratic	1
and	1
people	1
like	1
me	1
who	1
can	1
point	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
to	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
honorable	1
generations	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
of	1
breeding	1
talent	1
and	1
intellect	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
s	1
another	1
matter	1
and	1
have	1
never	1
curried	1
favor	1
with	1
anyone	1
never	1
depended	1
on	1
anyone	1
for	1
anything	1
like	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
grandfather	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
many	1
such	1
You	1
think	1
it	1
mean	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
my	1
forest	1
while	1
you	1
make	1
Ryabinin	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
but	1
you	1
get	1
rents	1
from	1
your	1
lands	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
while	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
prize	1
what	1
s	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
ancestors	1
or	1
been	1
won	1
by	1
hard	1
work	1
We	1
are	1
aristocrats	1
and	1
not	1
those	1
who	1
can	1
only	1
exist	1
by	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
powerful	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
be	1
bought	1
for	1
twopence	1
halfpenny	1
Well	1
but	1
whom	1
are	1
you	1
attacking	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sincerely	1
and	1
genially	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
bought	1
for	1
twopence	1
halfpenny	1
Levin	1
was	1
reckoning	1
him	1
too	1
Levin	1
s	1
warmth	1
gave	1
him	1
genuine	1
pleasure	1
Whom	1
are	1
you	1
attacking	1
Though	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
is	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
say	1
about	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
that	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
straight	1
out	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
And	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
did	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
was	1
rejected	1
and	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
is	1
nothing	1
now	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
a	1
painful	1
and	1
humiliating	1
reminiscence	1
What	1
ever	1
for	1
What	1
nonsense	1
But	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
Please	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
nasty	1
said	1
Levin	1
Now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
became	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
Stiva	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
angry	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
smiling	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
Of	1
course	1
not	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
we	1
ve	1
spoken	1
openly	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
stand	1
shooting	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
unusually	1
good	1
why	1
not	1
go	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
sleep	1
the	1
night	1
anyway	1
but	1
I	1
might	1
go	1
straight	1
from	1
shooting	1
to	1

Chapter	1
18	1
Although	1
all	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
inner	1
life	1
was	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
passion	1
his	1
external	1
life	1
unalterably	1
and	1
inevitably	1
followed	1
along	1
the	1
old	1
accustomed	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
social	1
and	1
regimental	1
ties	1
and	1
interests	1
The	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
took	1
an	1
important	1
place	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
life	1
both	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
because	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
him	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
fond	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
his	1
regiment	1
they	1
respected	1
him	1
too	1
and	1
were	1
proud	1
of	1
him	1
proud	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
immense	1
wealth	1
his	1
brilliant	1
education	1
and	1
abilities	1
and	1
the	1
path	1
open	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
success	1
distinction	1
and	1
ambition	1
had	1
disregarded	1
all	1
that	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
his	1
comrades	1
nearest	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
view	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
liking	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
bound	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
that	1
reputation	1
It	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
betray	1
his	1
secret	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
wildest	1
drinking	1
bouts	1
though	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
so	1
drunk	1
as	1
to	1
lose	1
all	1
control	1
of	1
himself	1
And	1
he	1
shut	1
up	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
thoughtless	1
comrades	1
who	1
attempted	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
his	1
connection	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
town	1
everyone	1
guessed	1
with	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
confidence	1
at	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
The	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
envied	1
him	1
for	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
irksome	1
factor	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
the	1
exalted	1
position	1
of	1
Karenin	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
publicity	1
of	1
their	1
connection	1
in	1
society	1
The	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
women	1
who	1
envied	1
Anna	1
and	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
weary	1
of	1
hearing	1
her	1
called	1
virtuous	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
their	1
predictions	1
and	1
were	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
decisive	1
turn	1
in	1
public	1
opinion	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
her	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
their	1
scorn	1
They	1
were	1
already	1
making	1
ready	1
their	1
handfuls	1
of	1
mud	1
to	1
fling	1
at	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
right	1
moment	1
arrived	1
The	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
aged	1
people	1
and	1
certain	1
great	1
personages	1
were	1
displeased	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
the	1
impending	1
scandal	1
in	1
society	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
mother	1
on	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
connection	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
pleased	1
at	1
it	1
because	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
finishing	1
touch	1
to	1
a	1
brilliant	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
liaison	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
too	1
that	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
taken	1
her	1
fancy	1
and	1
had	1
talked	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
was	1
after	1
all	1
just	1
like	1
all	1
other	1
pretty	1
and	1
well	1
bred	1
women	1
at	1
least	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Vronskaya	1

ideas	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
late	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
had	1
refused	1
a	1
position	1
offered	1
him	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
his	1
career	1
simply	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
constantly	1
seeing	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
She	1
learned	1
that	1
great	1
personages	1
were	1
displeased	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
and	1
she	1
changed	1
her	1
opinion	1
She	1
was	1
vexed	1
too	1
that	1
from	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
learn	1
of	1
this	1
connection	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
brilliant	1
graceful	1
worldly	1
liaison	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
welcomed	1
but	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Wertherish	1
desperate	1
passion	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
told	1
which	1
might	1
well	1
lead	1
him	1
into	1
imprudence	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
abrupt	1
departure	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
she	1
sent	1
her	1
elder	1
son	1
to	1
bid	1
him	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
This	1
elder	1
son	1
too	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
distinguish	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
love	1
his	1
might	1
be	1
big	1
or	1
little	1
passionate	1
or	1
passionless	1
lasting	1
or	1
passing	1
he	1
kept	1
a	1
ballet	1
girl	1
himself	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
lenient	1
in	1
these	1
matters	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
love	1
affair	1
was	1
viewed	1
with	1
displeasure	1
by	1
those	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
please	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
conduct	1
Besides	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
society	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
another	1
great	1
interest	1
horses	1
he	1
was	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
horses	1
That	1
year	1
races	1
and	1
a	1
steeplechase	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
for	1
the	1
officers	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
down	1
bought	1
a	1
thoroughbred	1
English	1
mare	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
affair	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
with	1
intense	1
though	1
reserved	1
excitement	1
These	1
two	1
passions	1
did	1
not	1
interfere	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
needed	1
occupation	1
and	1
distraction	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
recruit	1
and	1
rest	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
emotions	1
that	1
agitated	1
him	1
Chapter	1
19	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
at	1
Krasnoe	1
Selo	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
come	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
eat	1
beefsteak	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
messroom	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
strict	1
with	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
very	1
quickly	1
been	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
required	1
light	1
weight	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
avoid	1
gaining	1
flesh	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
eschewed	1
farinaceous	1
and	1
sweet	1
dishes	1
He	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
unbuttoned	1
over	1
a	1
white	1
waistcoat	1
resting	1
both	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
while	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
steak	1
he	1
had	1
ordered	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
French	1
novel	1
that	1
lay	1
open	1
on	1
his	1
plate	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
avoid	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
coming	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
promise	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
races	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
today	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
He	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
Betsy	1
s	1
summer	1
villa	1
He	1
visited	1
the	1
Karenins	1
summer	1
villa	1
as	1
rarely	1
as	1
possible	1
Now	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
and	1
he	1
pondered	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
Betsy	1
has	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
she	1
s	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
he	1
decided	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
the	1
book	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
his	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
Send	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
out	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
three	1
horses	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
steak	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
silver	1
dish	1
and	1
moving	1
the	1
dish	1
up	1
he	1
began	1
eating	1
From	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
next	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
balls	1
knocking	1
of	1
talk	1
and	1
laughter	1
Two	1
officers	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
door	1
one	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
feeble	1
delicate	1
face	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
joined	1
the	1
regiment	1
from	1
the	1
Corps	1
of	1
Pages	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
plump	1
elderly	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bracelet	1
on	1
his	1
wrist	1
and	1
little	1
eyes	1
lost	1
in	1
fat	1
Vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
them	1
frowned	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
them	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
read	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
What	1
Fortifying	1
yourself	1
for	1
your	1
work	1
said	1
the	1
plump	1
officer	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
As	1
you	1
see	1
responded	1
Vronsky	1
knitting	1
his	1
brows	1
wiping	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
So	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
fat	1
said	1
the	1
latter	1
turning	1
a	1
chair	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
What	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
angrily	1
making	1
a	1
wry	1
face	1
of	1
disgust	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
even	1
teeth	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
fat	1
Waiter	1
sherry	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
without	1
replying	1
and	1
moving	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
The	1
plump	1
officer	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
wines	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
You	1
choose	1
what	1
we	1
re	1
to	1
drink	1
he	1
said	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
card	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
Rhine	1
wine	1
please	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
stealing	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
pull	1
his	1
scarcely	1
visible	1
mustache	1
Seeing	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
round	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
got	1
up	1
Let	1
s	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
he	1
said	1
The	1
plump	1
officer	1
rose	1
submissively	1
and	1
they	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
there	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
tall	1
and	1
well	1
built	1
Captain	1
Yashvin	1
Nodding	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
lofty	1
contempt	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
officers	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
Ah	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
he	1
cried	1
bringing	1
his	1
big	1
hand	1
down	1
heavily	1
on	1
his	1
epaulet	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
round	1
angrily	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
immediately	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
expression	1
of	1
genial	1
and	1
manly	1
serenity	1
That	1
s	1
it	1
Alexey	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
in	1
his	1
loud	1
baritone	1
You	1
must	1
just	1
eat	1
a	1
mouthful	1
now	1
and	1
drink	1
only	1
one	1
tiny	1
glass	1
Oh	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
hungry	1
There	1
go	1
the	1
inseparables	1
Yashvin	1
dropped	1
glancing	1
sarcastically	1
at	1
the	1
two	1
officers	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
leaving	1
the	1
room	1
And	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
swathed	1
in	1
tight	1
riding	1
breeches	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
chair	1
too	1
low	1
for	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
knees	1
were	1
cramped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
sharp	1
angle	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
turn	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
Red	1
Theater	1
yesterday	1
Numerova	1
wasn	1
t	1
at	1
all	1
bad	1
Where	1
were	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
late	1
at	1
the	1
Tverskoys	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Ah	1
responded	1
Yashvin	1
Yashvin	1
a	1
gambler	1
and	1
a	1
rake	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
merely	1
without	1
moral	1
principles	1
but	1
of	1
immoral	1
principles	1
Yashvin	1
was	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
greatest	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
Vronsky	1
liked	1
him	1
both	1
for	1
his	1
exceptional	1
physical	1
strength	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
by	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
drink	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
and	1
do	1
without	1
sleep	1
without	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
degree	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
character	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
superior	1
officers	1
commanding	1
both	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
cards	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
play	1
for	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
drunk	1
always	1
with	1
such	1
skill	1
and	1
decision	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
reckoned	1
the	1
best	1
player	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
Club	1
Vronsky	1
respected	1
and	1
liked	1
Yashvin	1
particularly	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
Yashvin	1
liked	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
his	1
money	1
but	1
for	1
himself	1
And	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
with	1
whom	1
Vronsky	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
Yashvin	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
apparent	1
contempt	1
for	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
feeling	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
so	1
he	1
fancied	1
comprehend	1
the	1
intense	1
passion	1
which	1
now	1
filled	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
Moreover	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
that	1
Yashvin	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
took	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
gossip	1
and	1
scandal	1
and	1
interpreted	1
his	1
feeling	1
rightly	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
knew	1
and	1
believed	1
that	1
this	1
passion	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
jest	1
not	1
a	1
pastime	1
but	1
something	1
more	1
serious	1
and	1
important	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
passion	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
right	1
interpretation	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
Ah	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
announcement	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
Tverskoys	1
and	1
his	1
black	1
eyes	1
shining	1
he	1
plucked	1
at	1
his	1
left	1
mustache	1
and	1
began	1
twisting	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
mouth	1
a	1
bad	1
habit	1
he	1
had	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
yesterday	1
Win	1
anything	1
asked	1
Vronsky	1
Eight	1
thousand	1
But	1
three	1
don	1
t	1
count	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
pay	1
up	1
Oh	1
then	1
you	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
lose	1
over	1
me	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
laughing	1
Yashvin	1
had	1
bet	1
heavily	1
on	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
the	1
races	1
No	1
chance	1
of	1
my	1
losing	1
Mahotin	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
s	1
risky	1
And	1
the	1
conversation	1
passed	1
to	1
forecasts	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
race	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
just	1
now	1
Come	1
along	1
I	1
ve	1
finished	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
Yashvin	1
got	1
up	1
too	1
stretching	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
and	1
his	1
long	1
back	1
It	1
s	1
too	1
early	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
dine	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
drink	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
along	1
directly	1
Hi	1
wine	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
his	1
rich	1
voice	1
that	1
always	1
rang	1
out	1
so	1
loudly	1
at	1
drill	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
windows	1
shaking	1
now	1
No	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
shouted	1
again	1
immediately	1
after	1
You	1
re	1
going	1
home	1
so	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
out	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
Chapter	1

Vronsky	1

staying	1
in	1
a	1
roomy	1

Finnish	1
hut	1

into	1
two	1
by	1
a	1

Petritsky	1

in	1

too	1
Petritsky	1
was	1

when	1

Yashvin	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
hut	1
Get	1

Yashvin	1
going	1
behind	1
the	1

giving	1

Petritsky	1
jumped	1
up	1
suddenly	1
onto	1

looked	1
round	1
Your	1

he	1
said	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
waked	1
me	1
up	1
damn	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
d	1
look	1
in	1
again	1
And	1
pulling	1
up	1
the	1
rug	1
he	1
flung	1
himself	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
Oh	1
do	1
shut	1
up	1
Yashvin	1
he	1
said	1
getting	1
furious	1
with	1
Yashvin	1
who	1
was	1
pulling	1
the	1
rug	1
off	1
him	1
Shut	1
up	1
He	1
turned	1
over	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
You	1
d	1
better	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
to	1
drink	1
such	1
a	1
nasty	1
taste	1
in	1
my	1
mouth	1
that	1
Brandy	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
anything	1
boomed	1
Yashvin	1
Tereshtchenko	1
brandy	1
for	1
your	1
master	1
and	1
cucumbers	1
he	1
shouted	1
obviously	1
taking	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
voice	1
Brandy	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
Eh	1
queried	1
Petritsky	1
blinking	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
And	1
you	1
ll	1
drink	1
something	1
All	1
right	1
then	1
we	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
drink	1
together	1
Vronsky	1
have	1
a	1
drink	1
said	1
Petritsky	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
wrapping	1
the	1
tiger	1
skin	1
rug	1
round	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
partition	1
wall	1
raised	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
hummed	1
in	1
French	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
Thule	1
Vronsky	1
will	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
drink	1
Go	1
along	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
coat	1
his	1
valet	1
handed	1
to	1
him	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
asked	1
Yashvin	1
Oh	1
here	1
are	1
your	1
three	1
horses	1
he	1
added	1
seeing	1
the	1
carriage	1
drive	1
up	1
To	1
the	1
stables	1
and	1
I	1
ve	1
got	1
to	1
see	1
Bryansky	1
too	1
about	1
the	1
horses	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
promised	1
to	1
call	1
at	1
Bryansky	1
s	1
some	1
eight	1
miles	1
from	1
Peterhof	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
some	1
money	1
owing	1
for	1
some	1
horses	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
in	1
too	1
But	1
his	1
comrades	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
going	1
there	1
Petritsky	1
still	1
humming	1
winked	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
pout	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
Oh	1
yes	1
we	1
know	1
your	1
Bryansky	1
Mind	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
late	1
was	1
Yashvin	1
s	1
only	1
comment	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
How	1
s	1
my	1
roan	1
is	1
he	1
doing	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
inquired	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
middle	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
horses	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sold	1
Vronsky	1
Stop	1
cried	1
Petritsky	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
out	1
Your	1
brother	1
left	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
a	1
note	1
for	1
you	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
where	1
are	1
they	1
Vronsky	1
stopped	1
Well	1
where	1
are	1
they	1
Where	1
are	1
they	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
question	1
said	1
Petritsky	1
solemnly	1
moving	1
his	1
forefinger	1
upwards	1
from	1
his	1
nose	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
this	1
is	1
silly	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
lighted	1
the	1
fire	1
Here	1
somewhere	1
about	1
Come	1
enough	1
fooling	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
letter	1
No	1
I	1
ve	1
forgotten	1
really	1
Or	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
dream	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
getting	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
If	1
you	1
d	1
drunk	1
four	1
bottles	1
yesterday	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
you	1
d	1
forget	1
where	1
you	1
were	1
lying	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
I	1
ll	1
remember	1
Petritsky	1
went	1
behind	1
the	1
partition	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
This	1
was	1
how	1
I	1
was	1
lying	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
Yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
Petritsky	1
pulled	1
a	1
letter	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
mattress	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
hidden	1
it	1
Vronsky	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
note	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
was	1
expecting	1
from	1
his	1
mother	1
reproaching	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
note	1
was	1
from	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
theirs	1
thought	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
crumpling	1
up	1
the	1
letters	1
he	1
thrust	1
them	1
between	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
carefully	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
In	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
two	1
officers	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
another	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
quarters	1
were	1
always	1
a	1
meeting	1
place	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
Peterhof	1
Has	1
the	1
mare	1
come	1
from	1
Tsarskoe	1
Yes	1
but	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
yet	1
They	1
say	1
Mahotin	1
s	1
Gladiator	1
s	1
lame	1
Nonsense	1
But	1
however	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
race	1
in	1
this	1
mud	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
Here	1
are	1
my	1
saviors	1
cried	1
Petritsky	1
seeing	1
them	1
come	1
in	1
Before	1
him	1
stood	1
the	1
orderly	1
with	1
a	1
tray	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
salted	1
cucumbers	1
Here	1
s	1
Yashvin	1
ordering	1
me	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
pick	1
me	1
up	1
Well	1
you	1
did	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
us	1
yesterday	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
get	1
a	1
wink	1
of	1
sleep	1
all	1
night	1
Oh	1
didn	1
t	1
we	1
make	1
a	1
pretty	1
finish	1
said	1
Petritsky	1
Volkov	1
climbed	1
onto	1
the	1
roof	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
us	1
how	1
sad	1
he	1
was	1
I	1
said	1
Let	1
s	1
have	1
music	1
the	1
funeral	1
march	1
He	1
fairly	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
roof	1
over	1
the	1
funeral	1
march	1
Drink	1
it	1
up	1
you	1
positively	1
must	1
drink	1
the	1
brandy	1
and	1
then	1
seltzer	1
water	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
lemon	1
said	1
Yashvin	1
standing	1
over	1
Petritsky	1
like	1
a	1
mother	1
making	1
a	1
child	1
take	1
medicine	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
little	1
champagne	1
just	1
a	1
small	1
bottle	1
Come	1
there	1
s	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
that	1
Stop	1
a	1
bit	1
Vronsky	1
We	1
ll	1
all	1
have	1
a	1
drink	1
No	1
good	1
bye	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
drink	1
today	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
gaining	1
weight	1
All	1
right	1
then	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
it	1
alone	1
Give	1
us	1
the	1
seltzer	1
water	1
and	1
lemon	1
Vronsky	1
shouted	1
someone	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
outside	1
Well	1
You	1
d	1
better	1
get	1
your	1
hair	1
cut	1
it	1
ll	1
weigh	1
you	1
down	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
beginning	1
prematurely	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
little	1
bald	1
He	1
laughed	1
gaily	1
showing	1
his	1
even	1
teeth	1
and	1
pulling	1
his	1
cap	1
over	1
the	1
thin	1
place	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
carriage	1
To	1
the	1
stables	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
pulling	1
out	1
the	1
letters	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
through	1
but	1
he	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
put	1
off	1
reading	1
them	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
distract	1
his	1
attention	1
before	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
mare	1
Later	1
Chapter	1
21	1
The	1
temporary	1
stable	1
a	1
wooden	1
shed	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
up	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
and	1
there	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
her	1
there	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
ridden	1
her	1
out	1
for	1
exercise	1
himself	1
but	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
trainer	1
and	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
positively	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
condition	1
his	1
mare	1
had	1
arrived	1
yesterday	1
and	1
was	1
today	1
He	1
had	1
scarcely	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
when	1
his	1
groom	1
the	1
so	1
called	1
stable	1
boy	1
recognizing	1
the	1
carriage	1
some	1
way	1
off	1
called	1
the	1
trainer	1
A	1
dry	1
looking	1
Englishman	1
in	1
high	1
boots	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
clean	1
shaven	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
tuft	1
below	1
his	1
chin	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
walking	1
with	1
the	1
uncouth	1
gait	1
of	1
jockey	1
turning	1
his	1
elbows	1
out	1
and	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
Well	1
how	1
s	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
Vronsky	1
asked	1
in	1
English	1
All	1
right	1
sir	1
the	1
Englishman	1
s	1
voice	1
responded	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
his	1
throat	1
Better	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
he	1
added	1
touching	1
his	1
hat	1
I	1
ve	1
put	1
a	1
muzzle	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
fidgety	1
Better	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
it	1
ll	1
excite	1
the	1
mare	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
in	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
Come	1
along	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
frowning	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
shut	1
and	1
with	1
swinging	1
elbows	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
his	1
disjointed	1
gait	1
They	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
yard	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
A	1
stable	1
boy	1
spruce	1
and	1
smart	1
in	1
his	1
holiday	1
attire	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
broom	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
followed	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
shed	1
there	1
were	1
five	1
horses	1
in	1
their	1
separate	1
stalls	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
chief	1
rival	1
Gladiator	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
there	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
standing	1
among	1
them	1
Even	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
mare	1
Vronsky	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
Gladiator	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
etiquette	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
horse	1
but	1
improper	1
even	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
about	1
him	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
the	1
boy	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
horse	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
big	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
with	1
white	1
legs	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
Gladiator	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
another	1
man	1
s	1
open	1
letter	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
s	1
stall	1
The	1
horse	1
is	1
here	1
belonging	1
to	1
Mak	1
Mak	1
I	1
never	1
can	1
say	1
the	1
name	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
pointing	1
his	1
big	1
finger	1
and	1
dirty	1
nail	1
towards	1
Gladiator	1
s	1
stall	1
Mahotin	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
my	1
most	1
serious	1
rival	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
riding	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
I	1
d	1
bet	1
on	1
you	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
s	1
more	1
nervous	1
he	1
s	1
stronger	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
compliment	1
to	1
his	1
riding	1
In	1
a	1
steeplechase	1
it	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
riding	1
and	1
on	1
pluck	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
Of	1
pluck	1
that	1
is	1
energy	1
and	1
courage	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
enough	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
far	1
more	1
importance	1
he	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
have	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
pluck	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
want	1
more	1
thinning	1
down	1
Oh	1
no	1
answered	1
the	1
Englishman	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
speak	1
loud	1
The	1
mare	1
s	1
fidgety	1
he	1
added	1
nodding	1
towards	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
before	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
restless	1
stamping	1
in	1
the	1
straw	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
dimly	1
lighted	1
by	1
one	1
little	1
window	1
In	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
stood	1
a	1
dark	1
bay	1
mare	1
with	1
a	1
muzzle	1
on	1
picking	1
at	1
the	1
fresh	1
straw	1
with	1
her	1
hoofs	1
Looking	1
round	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
Vronsky	1
unconsciously	1
took	1
in	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
a	1
comprehensive	1
glance	1
all	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
mare	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
was	1
a	1
beast	1
of	1
medium	1
size	1
not	1
altogether	1
free	1
from	1
reproach	1
from	1
a	1
breeder	1
s	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
She	1
was	1
small	1
boned	1
all	1
over	1
though	1
her	1
chest	1
was	1
extremely	1
prominent	1
in	1
front	1
it	1
was	1
narrow	1
Her	1
hind	1
quarters	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
drooping	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
fore	1
legs	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
her	1
hind	1
legs	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
noticeable	1
curvature	1
The	1
muscles	1
of	1
both	1
hind	1
and	1
fore	1
legs	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
thick	1
but	1
across	1
her	1
shoulders	1
the	1
mare	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
broad	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
specially	1
striking	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
lean	1
from	1
training	1
The	1
bones	1
of	1
her	1
legs	1
below	1
the	1
knees	1
looked	1
no	1
thicker	1
than	1
a	1
finger	1
from	1
in	1
front	1
but	1
were	1
extraordinarily	1
thick	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
She	1
looked	1
altogether	1
except	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
pinched	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
and	1
pressed	1
out	1
in	1
depth	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
the	1
quality	1
that	1
makes	1
all	1
defects	1
forgotten	1
that	1
quality	1
was	1
blood	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
tells	1
as	1
the	1
English	1
expression	1
has	1
it	1
The	1
muscles	1
stood	1
up	1
sharply	1
under	1
the	1
network	1
of	1
sinews	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
delicate	1
mobile	1
skin	1
soft	1
as	1
satin	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
hard	1
as	1
bone	1
Her	1
clean	1
cut	1
head	1
with	1
prominent	1
bright	1
spirited	1
eyes	1
broadened	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
nostrils	1
that	1
showed	1
the	1
red	1
blood	1
in	1
the	1
cartilage	1
within	1
About	1
all	1
her	1
figure	1
and	1
especially	1
her	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
expression	1
of	1
energy	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
softness	1
She	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
creatures	1
which	1
seem	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
because	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
their	1
mouth	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
To	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
all	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
Directly	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
towards	1
her	1
she	1
drew	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
and	1
turning	1
back	1
her	1
prominent	1
eye	1
till	1
the	1
white	1
looked	1
bloodshot	1
she	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
figures	1
from	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
shaking	1
her	1
muzzle	1
and	1
shifting	1
lightly	1
from	1
one	1
leg	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
There	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
fidgety	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
There	1
darling	1
There	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mare	1
and	1
speaking	1
soothingly	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
came	1
the	1
more	1
excited	1
she	1
grew	1
Only	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
quieter	1
while	1
the	1
muscles	1
quivered	1
under	1
her	1
soft	1
delicate	1
coat	1
Vronsky	1
patted	1
her	1
strong	1
neck	1
straightened	1
over	1
her	1
sharp	1
withers	1
a	1
stray	1
lock	1
of	1
her	1
mane	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
moved	1
his	1
face	1
near	1
her	1
dilated	1
nostrils	1
transparent	1
as	1
a	1
bat	1
s	1
wing	1
She	1
drew	1
a	1
loud	1
breath	1
and	1
snorted	1
out	1
through	1
her	1
tense	1
nostrils	1
started	1
pricked	1
up	1
her	1
sharp	1
ear	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
her	1
strong	1
black	1
lip	1
towards	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
nip	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
sleeve	1
But	1
remembering	1
the	1
muzzle	1
she	1
shook	1
it	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
restlessly	1
stamping	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
her	1
shapely	1
legs	1
Quiet	1
darling	1
quiet	1
he	1
said	1
patting	1
her	1
again	1
over	1
her	1
hind	1
quarters	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
glad	1
sense	1
that	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
condition	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
box	1
The	1
mare	1
s	1
excitement	1
had	1
infected	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
throbbing	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
like	1
the	1
mare	1
longed	1
to	1
move	1
to	1
bite	1
it	1
was	1
both	1
dreadful	1
and	1
delicious	1
Well	1
I	1
rely	1
on	1
you	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
All	1
right	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
Oh	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
my	1
lord	1
he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
using	1
the	1
title	1
my	1
lord	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
used	1
before	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
amazement	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
stared	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
stare	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
Englishman	1
s	1
eyes	1
but	1
at	1
his	1
forehead	1
astounded	1
at	1
the	1
impertinence	1
of	1
his	1
question	1
But	1
realizing	1
that	1
in	1
asking	1
this	1
the	1
Englishman	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
employer	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
jockey	1
he	1
answered	1
I	1
ve	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bryansky	1
s	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
home	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
How	1
often	1
I	1
m	1
asked	1
that	1
question	1
today	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
blushed	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
rarely	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
Englishman	1
looked	1
gravely	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
too	1
knew	1
where	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
going	1
he	1
added	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
s	1
to	1
keep	1
quiet	1
before	1
a	1
race	1
said	1
he	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
or	1
upset	1
about	1
anything	1
All	1
right	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
and	1
jumping	1
into	1
his	1
carriage	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
Peterhof	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
many	1
paces	1
away	1
the	1
dark	1
clouds	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
threatening	1
rain	1
all	1
day	1
broke	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
downpour	1
of	1
rain	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
thought	1
Vronsky	1
putting	1
up	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
It	1
was	1
muddy	1
before	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
perfect	1
swamp	1
As	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
solitude	1
in	1
the	1
closed	1
carriage	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
letter	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
note	1
and	1
read	1
them	1
through	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
Everyone	1
his	1
mother	1
his	1
brother	1
everyone	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
interfere	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
This	1
interference	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
angry	1
hatred	1
a	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
rarely	1
known	1
before	1
What	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
theirs	1
Why	1
does	1
everybody	1
feel	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
concern	1
himself	1
about	1
me	1
And	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
worry	1
me	1
so	1
Just	1
because	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
they	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
common	1
vulgar	1
worldly	1
intrigue	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
alone	1
They	1
feel	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
something	1
different	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
pastime	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
is	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
life	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
it	1
annoys	1
them	1
Whatever	1
our	1
destiny	1
is	1
or	1
may	1
be	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
ourselves	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
complain	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
we	1
linking	1
himself	1
with	1
Anna	1
No	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
teach	1
us	1
how	1
to	1
live	1
They	1
haven	1
t	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
happiness	1
is	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
without	1
our	1
love	1
for	1
us	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
happiness	1
nor	1
unhappiness	1
no	1
life	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
He	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
interference	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
right	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
Anna	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
momentary	1
impulse	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
as	1
worldly	1
intrigues	1
do	1
pass	1
leaving	1
no	1
other	1
traces	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
either	1
but	1
pleasant	1
or	1
unpleasant	1
memories	1
He	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
her	1
position	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
there	1
was	1
for	1
them	1
conspicuous	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
concealing	1
their	1
love	1
in	1
lying	1
and	1
deceiving	1
and	1
in	1
lying	1
deceiving	1
feigning	1
and	1
continually	1
thinking	1
of	1
others	1
when	1
the	1
passion	1
that	1
united	1
them	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
oblivious	1
of	1
everything	1
else	1
but	1
their	1
love	1
He	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
constantly	1
recurring	1
instances	1
of	1
inevitable	1
necessity	1
for	1
lying	1
and	1
deceit	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
against	1
his	1
natural	1
bent	1
He	1
recalled	1
particularly	1
vividly	1
the	1
shame	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
detected	1
in	1
her	1
at	1
this	1
necessity	1
for	1
lying	1
and	1
deceit	1
And	1
he	1
experienced	1
the	1
strange	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
sometimes	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
secret	1
love	1
for	1
Anna	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
loathing	1
for	1
something	1
whether	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
or	1
for	1
himself	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
But	1
he	1
always	1
drove	1
away	1
this	1
strange	1
feeling	1
Now	1
too	1
he	1
shook	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
continued	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
Yes	1
she	1
was	1
unhappy	1
before	1
but	1
proud	1
and	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
feel	1
secure	1
in	1
her	1
dignity	1
though	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
show	1
it	1
Yes	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
decided	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
idea	1
clearly	1
presented	1
itself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
this	1
false	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
sooner	1
the	1
better	1
Throw	1
up	1
everything	1
she	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
hide	1
ourselves	1
somewhere	1
alone	1
with	1
our	1
love	1

said	1
to	1
himself	1
Chapter	1
22	1
The	1
rain	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
Vronsky	1
arrived	1
his	1
shaft	1
horse	1
trotting	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
and	1
dragging	1
the	1
trace	1
horses	1
galloping	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
their	1
reins	1
hanging	1
loose	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
peeped	1
out	1
again	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
villas	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
limetrees	1
in	1
the	1
gardens	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
streets	1
sparkled	1
with	1
wet	1
brilliance	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
twigs	1
came	1
a	1
pleasant	1
drip	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
roofs	1
rushing	1
streams	1
of	1
water	1
He	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
shower	1
spoiling	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
but	1
was	1
rejoicing	1
now	1
that	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
rain	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
alone	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
who	1
had	1
lately	1
returned	1
from	1
a	1
foreign	1
watering	1
place	1
had	1
not	1
moved	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
Hoping	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
alone	1
Vronsky	1
alighted	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
avoid	1
attracting	1
attention	1
before	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
street	1
door	1
but	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
Has	1
your	1
master	1
come	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
gardener	1
No	1
sir	1
The	1
mistress	1
is	1
at	1
home	1
But	1
will	1
you	1
please	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
there	1
are	1
servants	1
there	1
the	1
gardener	1
answered	1
They	1
ll	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
No	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
And	1
feeling	1
satisfied	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
alone	1
and	1
wanting	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
by	1
surprise	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
today	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
expect	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
races	1
he	1
walked	1
holding	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
stepping	1
cautiously	1
over	1
the	1
sandy	1
path	1
bordered	1
with	1
flowers	1
to	1
the	1
terrace	1
that	1
looked	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
garden	1
Vronsky	1
forgot	1
now	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
hardships	1
and	1
difficulties	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
directly	1
not	1
in	1
imagination	1
but	1
living	1
all	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
in	1
stepping	1
on	1
his	1
whole	1
foot	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
creak	1
up	1
the	1
worn	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
when	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
what	1
he	1
always	1
forgot	1
and	1
what	1
caused	1
the	1
most	1
torturing	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
son	1
with	1
his	1
questioning	1
hostile	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
eyes	1
This	1
boy	1
was	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
a	1
check	1
upon	1
their	1
freedom	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
present	1
both	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
avoid	1
speaking	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
repeated	1
before	1
everyone	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
refer	1
by	1
hints	1
to	1
anything	1
the	1
boy	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
They	1
had	1
made	1
no	1
agreement	1
about	1
this	1
it	1
had	1
settled	1
itself	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
wounding	1
themselves	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
child	1
In	1
his	1
presence	1
they	1
talked	1
like	1
acquaintances	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
caution	1
Vronsky	1
often	1
saw	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
intent	1
bewildered	1
glance	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
shyness	1
uncertainty	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
friendliness	1
at	1
another	1
coldness	1
and	1
reserve	1
in	1
the	1
boy	1
s	1
manner	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
felt	1
that	1
between	1
this	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
there	1
existed	1
some	1
important	1
bond	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
As	1
a	1
fact	1
the	1
boy	1
did	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
this	1
relation	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
painfully	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
clear	1
to	1
himself	1
what	1
feeling	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
With	1
a	1
child	1
s	1
keen	1
instinct	1
for	1
every	1
manifestation	1
of	1
feeling	1
he	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
his	1
governess	1
his	1
nurse	1
all	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
dislike	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
looked	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
aversion	1
though	1
they	1
never	1
said	1
anything	1
about	1
him	1
while	1
his	1
mother	1
looked	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
greatest	1
friend	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
How	1
ought	1
I	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
If	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
my	1
fault	1
either	1
I	1
m	1
stupid	1
or	1
a	1
naughty	1
boy	1
thought	1
the	1
child	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
caused	1
his	1
dubious	1
inquiring	1
sometimes	1
hostile	1
expression	1
and	1
the	1
shyness	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
which	1
Vronsky	1
found	1
so	1
irksome	1
This	1
child	1
s	1
presence	1
always	1
and	1
infallibly	1
called	1
up	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
inexplicable	1
loathing	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
of	1
late	1
This	1
child	1
s	1
presence	1
called	1
up	1
both	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
in	1
Anna	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
sailor	1
who	1
sees	1
by	1
the	1
compass	1
that	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
swiftly	1
moving	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
one	1
but	1
that	1
to	1
arrest	1
his	1
motion	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
that	1
every	1
instant	1
is	1
carrying	1
him	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
admit	1
to	1
himself	1
his	1
deviation	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
direction	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
admitting	1
his	1
certain	1
ruin	1
This	1
child	1
with	1
his	1
innocent	1
outlook	1
upon	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
compass	1
that	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
point	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
departed	1
from	1
what	1
they	1
knew	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
This	1
time	1
Seryozha	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
completely	1
alone	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
walk	1
and	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
She	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
manservant	1
and	1
a	1
maid	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
Dressed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
gown	1
deeply	1
embroidered	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
behind	1
some	1
flowers	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
Bending	1
her	1
curly	1
black	1
head	1
she	1
pressed	1
her	1
forehead	1
against	1
a	1
cool	1
watering	1
pot	1
that	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
parapet	1
and	1
both	1
her	1
lovely	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
rings	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
clasped	1
the	1
pot	1
The	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
her	1
head	1
her	1
neck	1
her	1
hands	1
struck	1
Vronsky	1
every	1
time	1
as	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
unexpected	1
He	1
stood	1
still	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
But	1
directly	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
to	1
come	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
watering	1
pot	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
towards	1
him	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
You	1
are	1
ill	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
French	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
remembering	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
spectators	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
towards	1
the	1
balcony	1
door	1
and	1
reddened	1
a	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
reddened	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
and	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
guard	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
quite	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
pressing	1
his	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
tightly	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
thee	1
Mercy	1
what	1
cold	1
hands	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
startled	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
m	1
alone	1
and	1
expecting	1
Seryozha	1
he	1
s	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
they	1
ll	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
this	1
side	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
efforts	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
coming	1
but	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
pass	1
the	1
day	1
without	1
seeing	1
you	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
speaking	1
French	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
avoid	1
using	1
the	1
stiff	1
Russian	1
plural	1
form	1
so	1
impossibly	1
frigid	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
dangerously	1
intimate	1
singular	1
Forgive	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
But	1
you	1
re	1
ill	1
or	1
worried	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
bending	1
over	1
her	1
What	1
were	1
you	1
thinking	1
of	1
Always	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
She	1
spoke	1
the	1
truth	1
If	1
ever	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
answered	1
truly	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
of	1
her	1
happiness	1
and	1
her	1
unhappiness	1
She	1
was	1
thinking	1
just	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
of	1
this	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
she	1
wondered	1
that	1
to	1
others	1
to	1
Betsy	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
her	1
secret	1
connection	1
with	1
Tushkevitch	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
easy	1
while	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
torture	1
Today	1
this	1
thought	1
gained	1
special	1
poignancy	1
from	1
certain	1
other	1
considerations	1
She	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
races	1
He	1
answered	1
her	1
questions	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
agitated	1
trying	1
to	1
calm	1
her	1
he	1
began	1
telling	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
simplest	1
tone	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
races	1
Tell	1
him	1
or	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
quiet	1
affectionate	1
eyes	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
happy	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
races	1
that	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
understand	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
this	1
fact	1
to	1
us	1
But	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1
told	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
thinking	1
of	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
interrupting	1
his	1
narrative	1
please	1
tell	1
me	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
bending	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
she	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
her	1
eyes	1
shining	1
under	1
their	1
long	1
lashes	1
Her	1
hand	1
shook	1
as	1
it	1
played	1
with	1
a	1
leaf	1
she	1
had	1
picked	1
He	1
saw	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
expressed	1
that	1
utter	1
subjection	1
that	1
slavish	1
devotion	1
which	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
win	1
her	1
I	1
see	1
something	1
has	1
happened	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
knowing	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
trouble	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sharing	1
Tell	1
me	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
he	1
repeated	1
imploringly	1
Yes	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
realize	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
it	1
Better	1
not	1
tell	1
why	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
proof	1
she	1
thought	1
still	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
and	1
feeling	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
leaf	1
was	1
trembling	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
he	1
repeated	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
I	1
m	1
with	1
child	1
she	1
said	1
softly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
The	1
leaf	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
shook	1
more	1
violently	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
watching	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
He	1
turned	1
white	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
but	1
stopped	1
he	1
dropped	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
sank	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
Yes	1
he	1
realizes	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
gratefully	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
mistaken	1
in	1
thinking	1
he	1
realized	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
as	1
she	1
a	1
woman	1
realized	1
it	1
On	1
hearing	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
tenfold	1
intensity	1
that	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
loathing	1
of	1
someone	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
turning	1
point	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
longing	1
for	1
had	1
come	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
concealing	1
things	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
inevitable	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
soon	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
their	1
unnatural	1
position	1
But	1
besides	1
that	1
her	1
emotion	1
physically	1
affected	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
submissive	1
tenderness	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
terrace	1
Yes	1
he	1
said	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
resolutely	1
Neither	1
you	1
nor	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
our	1
relations	1
as	1
a	1
passing	1
amusement	1
and	1
now	1
our	1
fate	1
is	1
sealed	1
It	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
deception	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
living	1
Put	1
an	1
end	1
How	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
Alexey	1
she	1
said	1
softly	1
She	1
was	1
calmer	1
now	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
smile	1
Leave	1
your	1
husband	1
and	1
make	1
our	1
life	1
one	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
she	1
answered	1
scarcely	1
audibly	1
Yes	1
but	1
altogether	1
altogether	1
But	1
how	1
Alexey	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
melancholy	1
mockery	1
at	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
my	1
husband	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
position	1
We	1
must	1
take	1
our	1
line	1
he	1
said	1
Anything	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
re	1
living	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
torture	1
yourself	1
over	1
everything	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
your	1
son	1
and	1
your	1
husband	1
Oh	1
not	1
over	1
my	1
husband	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
quiet	1
smile	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
him	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
exist	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
speaking	1
sincerely	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
You	1
worry	1
about	1
him	1
too	1
Oh	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
suddenly	1
a	1
hot	1
flush	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
her	1
cheeks	1
her	1
brow	1
her	1
neck	1
crimsoned	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
shame	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
But	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
talk	1
of	1
him	1
Chapter	1
23	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
already	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
resolutely	1
as	1
now	1
tried	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
consider	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
confronted	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
superficiality	1
and	1
triviality	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
met	1
his	1
appeal	1
now	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
or	1
would	1
not	1
face	1
as	1
though	1
directly	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
this	1
she	1
the	1
real	1
Anna	1
retreated	1
somehow	1
into	1
herself	1
and	1
another	1
strange	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
woman	1
came	1
out	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
feared	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
today	1
he	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
out	1
Whether	1
he	1
knows	1
or	1
not	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
quiet	1
and	1
resolute	1
tone	1
that	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
us	1
We	1
cannot	1
you	1
cannot	1
stay	1
like	1
this	1
especially	1
now	1
What	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
asked	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
frivolous	1
irony	1
She	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
feared	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
her	1
condition	1
too	1
lightly	1
was	1
now	1
vexed	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
deducing	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
some	1
step	1
Tell	1
him	1
everything	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
Very	1
well	1
let	1
us	1
suppose	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
all	1
beforehand	1
and	1
a	1
wicked	1
light	1
gleamed	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
soft	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
Eh	1
you	1
love	1
another	1
man	1
and	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
criminal	1
intrigues	1
with	1
him	1
Mimicking	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
threw	1
an	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
criminal	1
as	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
I	1
warned	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
results	1
in	1
the	1
religious	1
the	1
civil	1
and	1
the	1
domestic	1
relation	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
listened	1
to	1
me	1
Now	1
I	1
cannot	1
let	1
you	1
disgrace	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
about	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
jest	1
disgrace	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
she	1
added	1
In	1
general	1
terms	1
he	1
ll	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
manner	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
distinctness	1
and	1
precision	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
but	1
will	1
take	1
all	1
measures	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
scandal	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
calmly	1
and	1
punctually	1
act	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
words	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
a	1
machine	1
and	1
a	1
spiteful	1
machine	1
when	1
he	1
s	1
angry	1
she	1
added	1
recalling	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
his	1
figure	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
and	1
reckoning	1
against	1
him	1
every	1
defect	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
softening	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
wrong	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
doing	1
him	1
But	1
Anna	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
persuasive	1
voice	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
we	1
absolutely	1
must	1
anyway	1
tell	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
line	1
he	1
takes	1
What	1
run	1
away	1
And	1
why	1
not	1
run	1
away	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
we	1
can	1
keep	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
suffer	1
Yes	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
become	1
your	1
mistress	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
Anna	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
reproachful	1
tenderness	1
Yes	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
become	1
your	1
mistress	1
and	1
complete	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
Again	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
my	1
son	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
that	1
word	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
she	1
with	1
her	1
strong	1
and	1
truthful	1
nature	1
could	1
endure	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
deceit	1
and	1
not	1
long	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
suspect	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
son	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
pronounce	1
When	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
future	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
abandoned	1
his	1
father	1
she	1
felt	1
such	1
terror	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
face	1
it	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
woman	1
could	1
only	1
try	1
to	1
comfort	1
herself	1
with	1
lying	1
assurances	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
remain	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
fearful	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
speaking	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
tone	1
sincere	1
and	1
tender	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
But	1
Anna	1
Never	1
Leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
baseness	1
all	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
arrange	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
And	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
Never	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
Do	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
No	1
no	1
promise	1
I	1
promise	1
everything	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
especially	1
after	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
when	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
I	1
she	1
repeated	1
Yes	1
I	1
am	1
worried	1
sometimes	1
but	1
that	1
will	1
pass	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
talk	1
about	1
this	1
When	1
you	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
then	1
it	1
worries	1
me	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
truthful	1
nature	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
I	1
grieve	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
often	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
ruined	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
for	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
thinking	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
sacrifice	1
everything	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
myself	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
unhappy	1
I	1
unhappy	1
she	1
said	1
coming	1
closer	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
smile	1
of	1
love	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
hungry	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
food	1
He	1
may	1
be	1
cold	1
and	1
dressed	1
in	1
rags	1
and	1
ashamed	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
unhappy	1
I	1
unhappy	1
No	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
unhappiness	1
She	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
voice	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
glancing	1
swiftly	1
round	1
the	1
terrace	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
impulsively	1
Her	1
eyes	1
glowed	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
lovely	1
hands	1
covered	1
with	1
rings	1
took	1
his	1
head	1
looked	1
a	1
long	1
look	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
putting	1
up	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
smiling	1
parted	1
lips	1
swiftly	1
kissed	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
both	1
eyes	1
and	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
but	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
back	1
When	1
he	1
murmured	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
gazing	1
in	1
ecstasy	1
at	1
her	1
Tonight	1
at	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
she	1
whispered	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
her	1
light	1
swift	1
step	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
son	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
garden	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
nurse	1
had	1
taken	1
shelter	1
in	1
an	1
arbor	1
Well	1
au	1
revoir	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
must	1
soon	1
be	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
races	1
Betsy	1
promised	1
to	1
fetch	1
me	1
Vronsky	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
went	1
away	1
hurriedly	1
Chapter	1
24	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
on	1
the	1
Karenins	1
balcony	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
greatly	1
agitated	1
and	1
lost	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
figures	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
s	1
face	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
what	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
highroad	1
and	1
walked	1
picking	1
his	1
way	1
carefully	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
to	1
his	1
carriage	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
completely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
Anna	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
what	1
o	1
clock	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bryansky	1
s	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
only	1
the	1
external	1
faculty	1
of	1
memory	1
that	1
points	1
out	1
each	1
step	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
take	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
coachman	1
who	1
was	1
dozing	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
already	1
lengthening	1
of	1
a	1
thick	1
limetree	1
he	1
admired	1
the	1
shifting	1
clouds	1
of	1
midges	1
circling	1
over	1
the	1
hot	1
horses	1
and	1
waking	1
the	1
coachman	1
he	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
Bryansky	1
s	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
driving	1
nearly	1
five	1
miles	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sufficiently	1
recovered	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
and	1
realize	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
half	1
past	1
five	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
late	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
races	1
fixed	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
Mounted	1
Guards	1
race	1
then	1
the	1
officers	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
race	1
then	1
the	1
three	1
mile	1
race	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
race	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
He	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
his	1
race	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Bryansky	1
s	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
arrive	1
when	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
Bryansky	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
drive	1
on	1
telling	1
the	1
coachman	1
not	1
to	1
spare	1
the	1
horses	1
He	1
reached	1
Bryansky	1
s	1
spent	1
five	1
minutes	1
there	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
This	1
rapid	1
drive	1
calmed	1
him	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
painful	1
in	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Anna	1
all	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
indefiniteness	1
left	1
by	1
their	1
conversation	1
had	1
slipped	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
He	1
was	1
thinking	1
now	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
anyhow	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
blissful	1
interview	1
awaiting	1
him	1
that	1
night	1
flashed	1
across	1
his	1
imagination	1
like	1
a	1
flaming	1
light	1
The	1
excitement	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
race	1
gained	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
overtaking	1
carriages	1
driving	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
summer	1
villas	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
At	1
his	1
quarters	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
left	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
his	1
valet	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
changing	1
his	1
clothes	1
his	1
valet	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
second	1
race	1
had	1
begun	1
already	1
that	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
boy	1
had	1
twice	1
run	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
stables	1
Dressing	1
without	1
hurry	1
he	1
never	1
hurried	1
himself	1
and	1
never	1
lost	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
Vronsky	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
sheds	1
From	1
the	1
sheds	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
perfect	1
sea	1
of	1
carriages	1
and	1
people	1
on	1
foot	1
soldiers	1
surrounding	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
and	1
pavilions	1
swarming	1
with	1
people	1
The	1
second	1
race	1
was	1
apparently	1
going	1
on	1
for	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sheds	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
bell	1
ringing	1
Going	1

led	1
to	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
forage	1
horsecloth	1
with	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
huge	1
ears	1
edged	1
with	1
blue	1
Where	1

Cord	1

In	1

In	1

They	1
were	1
just	1
going	1
to	1

her	1
out	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
All	1
right	1
All	1
right	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman	1
don	1
t	1
upset	1
yourself	1
Vronsky	1
once	1
more	1
took	1
in	1
in	1
one	1
glance	1
the	1
exquisite	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
mare	1
who	1
was	1
quivering	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
he	1
tore	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stable	1
He	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilions	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
moment	1
for	1
escaping	1
attention	1
The	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
race	1
was	1
just	1
finishing	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
horse	1
guard	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
hussar	1
behind	1
urging	1
their	1
horses	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
effort	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
winning	1
post	1
From	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
all	1
were	1
crowding	1
to	1
the	1
winning	1
post	1
and	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
guards	1
were	1
shouting	1
loudly	1
their	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
expected	1
triumph	1
of	1
their	1
officer	1
and	1
comrade	1
Vronsky	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
unnoticed	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
bell	1
rang	1
at	1
the	1
finish	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
mudspattered	1
horse	1
guard	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
first	1
bending	1
over	1
the	1
saddle	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
his	1
panting	1
gray	1
horse	1
that	1
looked	1
dark	1
with	1
sweat	1
The	1
horse	1
stiffening	1
out	1
its	1
legs	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
stopped	1
its	1
rapid	1
course	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
guards	1
looked	1
round	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
waking	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
heavy	1
sleep	1
and	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
smile	1
A	1
crowd	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
outsiders	1
pressed	1
round	1
him	1
Vronsky	1
intentionally	1
avoided	1
that	1
select	1
crowd	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
world	1
which	1
was	1
moving	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
discreet	1
freedom	1
before	1
the	1
pavilions	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
Betsy	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
purposely	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
near	1
them	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
something	1
distracting	1
his	1
attention	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
met	1
and	1
stopped	1
by	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
previous	1
races	1
and	1
kept	1
asking	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
late	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
racers	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
pavilion	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
prizes	1
and	1
all	1
attention	1
was	1
directed	1
to	1
that	1
point	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
elder	1
brother	1
Alexander	1
a	1
colonel	1
with	1
heavy	1
fringed	1
epaulets	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
tall	1
though	1
as	1
broadly	1
built	1
as	1
Alexey	1
and	1
handsomer	1
and	1
rosier	1
than	1
he	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
red	1
nose	1
and	1
an	1
open	1
drunken	1
looking	1
face	1
Did	1
you	1
get	1
my	1
note	1
he	1
said	1
There	1
s	1
never	1
any	1
finding	1
you	1
Alexander	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
dissolute	1
life	1
and	1
in	1
especial	1
the	1
drunken	1
habits	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
notorious	1
was	1
quite	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
circle	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
might	1
be	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
kept	1
a	1
smiling	1
countenance	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
jesting	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
about	1
something	1
of	1
little	1
moment	1
I	1
got	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
really	1
can	1
t	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
worrying	1
yourself	1
about	1
said	1
Alexey	1
I	1
m	1
worrying	1
myself	1
because	1
the	1
remark	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
weren	1
t	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
seen	1
in	1
Peterhof	1
on	1
Monday	1
There	1
are	1
matters	1
which	1
only	1
concern	1
those	1
directly	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
matter	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
worried	1
about	1
is	1
Yes	1
but	1
if	1
so	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
cut	1
the	1
service	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
meddle	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
Alexey	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
frowning	1
face	1
turned	1
white	1
and	1
his	1
prominent	1
lower	1
jaw	1
quivered	1
which	1
happened	1
rarely	1
with	1
him	1
Being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
warm	1
heart	1
he	1
was	1
seldom	1
angry	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
chin	1
quivered	1
then	1
as	1
Alexander	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
dangerous	1
Alexander	1
Vronsky	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
Mother	1
s	1
letter	1
Answer	1
it	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
worry	1
about	1
anything	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
race	1
Bonne	1
chance	1
	1
he	1
added	1
smiling	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
But	1
after	1
him	1
another	1
friendly	1
greeting	1
brought	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
So	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
recognize	1
your	1
friends	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
mon	1
cher	1
	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
conspicuously	1
brilliant	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
brilliance	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
his	1
face	1
rosy	1
and	1
his	1
whiskers	1
sleek	1
and	1
glossy	1
I	1
came	1
up	1
yesterday	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
delighted	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
your	1
triumph	1
When	1
shall	1
we	1
meet	1
Come	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
the	1
messroom	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
squeezing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
with	1
apologies	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
where	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
being	1
led	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
steeplechase	1
The	1
horses	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
race	1
were	1
being	1
led	1
home	1
steaming	1
and	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
stable	1
boys	1
and	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
fresh	1
horses	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
race	1
made	1
their	1
appearance	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
English	1
racers	1
wearing	1
horsecloths	1
and	1
looking	1
with	1
their	1
drawn	1
up	1
bellies	1
like	1
strange	1
huge	1
birds	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
was	1
led	1
in	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
lean	1
and	1
beautiful	1
lifting	1
up	1
her	1
elastic	1
rather	1
long	1
pasterns	1
as	1
though	1
moved	1
by	1
springs	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
her	1
they	1
were	1
taking	1
the	1
rug	1
off	1
the	1
lop	1
eared	1
Gladiator	1
The	1
strong	1
exquisite	1
perfectly	1
correct	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
stallion	1
with	1
his	1
superb	1
hind	1
quarters	1
and	1
excessively	1
short	1
pasterns	1
almost	1
over	1
his	1
hoofs	1
attracted	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
attention	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
mare	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
detained	1
by	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
Oh	1
there	1
s	1
Karenin	1
said	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
chatting	1
He	1
s	1
looking	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
pavilion	1
Didn	1
t	1
you	1
see	1
her	1
No	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
glancing	1
round	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilion	1
where	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
pointing	1
out	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
mare	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
saddle	1
about	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
direction	1
when	1
the	1
competitors	1
were	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
pavilion	1
to	1
receive	1
their	1
numbers	1
and	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
row	1
at	1
starting	1
Seventeen	1
officers	1
looking	1
serious	1
and	1
severe	1
many	1
with	1
pale	1
faces	1
met	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
pavilion	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
numbers	1
Vronsky	1
drew	1
the	1
number	1
seven	1
The	1
cry	1
was	1
heard	1
Mount	1
Feeling	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
riding	1
in	1
the	1
race	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
upon	1
which	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fastened	1
Vronsky	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
mare	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
nervous	1
tension	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
usually	1
became	1
deliberate	1
and	1
composed	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
Cord	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
best	1
clothes	1
a	1
black	1
coat	1
buttoned	1
up	1
a	1
stiffly	1
starched	1
collar	1
which	1
propped	1
up	1
his	1
cheeks	1
a	1
round	1
black	1
hat	1
and	1
top	1
boots	1
He	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
dignified	1
as	1
ever	1
and	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
holding	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
by	1
both	1
reins	1
standing	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
was	1
still	1
trembling	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
fever	1
Her	1
eye	1
full	1
of	1
fire	1
glanced	1
sideways	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
Vronsky	1
slipped	1
his	1
finger	1
under	1
the	1
saddle	1
girth	1
The	1
mare	1
glanced	1
aslant	1
at	1
him	1
drew	1
up	1
her	1
lip	1
and	1
twitched	1
her	1
ear	1
The	1
Englishman	1
puckered	1
up	1
his	1
lips	1
intending	1
to	1
indicate	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
anyone	1
should	1
verify	1
his	1
saddling	1
Get	1
up	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
feel	1
so	1
excited	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
rivals	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
them	1
during	1
the	1
race	1
Two	1
were	1
already	1
riding	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
start	1
Galtsin	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
more	1
formidable	1
rivals	1
was	1
moving	1
round	1
a	1
bay	1
horse	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
mount	1
A	1
little	1
light	1
hussar	1
in	1
tight	1
riding	1
breeches	1
rode	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
crouched	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
cat	1
on	1
the	1
saddle	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
English	1
jockeys	1
Prince	1
Kuzovlev	1
sat	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
on	1
his	1
thoroughbred	1
mare	1
from	1
the	1
Grabovsky	1
stud	1
while	1
an	1
English	1
groom	1
led	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
comrades	1
knew	1
Kuzovlev	1
and	1
his	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
weak	1
nerves	1
and	1
terrible	1
vanity	1
They	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
everything	1
afraid	1
of	1
riding	1
a	1
spirited	1
horse	1
But	1
now	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
terrible	1
because	1
people	1
broke	1
their	1
necks	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
doctor	1
standing	1
at	1
each	1
obstacle	1
and	1
an	1
ambulance	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
mercy	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
race	1
Their	1
eyes	1
met	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
encouraging	1
nod	1
Only	1
one	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
chief	1
rival	1
Mahotin	1
on	1
Gladiator	1
Don	1
t	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
said	1
Cord	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
remember	1
one	1
thing	1
don	1
t	1
hold	1
her	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
fences	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
urge	1
her	1
on	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
as	1
she	1
likes	1
All	1
right	1
all	1
right	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
taking	1
the	1
reins	1
If	1
you	1
can	1
lead	1
the	1
race	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
lose	1
heart	1
till	1
the	1
last	1
minute	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
behind	1
Before	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
move	1
Vronsky	1
stepped	1
with	1
an	1
agile	1
vigorous	1
movement	1
into	1
the	1
steel	1
toothed	1
stirrup	1
and	1
lightly	1
and	1
firmly	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
creaking	1
leather	1
of	1
the	1
saddle	1
Getting	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup	1
he	1
smoothed	1
the	1
double	1
reins	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
between	1
his	1
fingers	1
and	1
Cord	1
let	1
go	1
As	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
foot	1
to	1
put	1
first	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
started	1
dragging	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
with	1
her	1
long	1
neck	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
on	1
springs	1
shaking	1
her	1
rider	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
Cord	1
quickened	1
his	1
step	1
following	1
him	1

trying	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
her	1
rider	1
first	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
tried	1
in	1
vain	1
with	1
voice	1
and	1
hand	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
They	1
were	1
just	1
reaching	1
the	1
dammed	1
up	1
stream	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
starting	1
point	1
Several	1
of	1
the	1
riders	1
were	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
several	1
behind	1
when	1
suddenly	1
Vronsky	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
horse	1
galloping	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
overtaken	1
by	1
Mahotin	1
on	1
his	1
white	1
legged	1

eared	1
Gladiator	1
Mahotin	1
smiled	1
showing	1
his	1
long	1
teeth	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
him	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
him	1
and	1
regarded	1
him	1
now	1
as	1
his	1
most	1
formidable	1
rival	1
He	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
galloping	1
past	1
and	1
exciting	1
his	1
mare	1
Frou	1

started	1
into	1

forward	1
made	1
two	1
bounds	1
and	1
fretting	1
at	1
the	1
tightened	1
reins	1
passed	1
into	1
a	1
jolting	1
trot	1
bumping	1
her	1
rider	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
Cord	1
too	1
scowled	1
and	1
followed	1
Vronsky	1
almost	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
Chapter	1
25	1
There	1
were	1
seventeen	1
officers	1
in	1
all	1
riding	1
in	1
this	1
race	1
The	1
race	1
course	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
three	1
mile	1
ring	1
of	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
ellipse	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
pavilion	1
On	1
this	1
course	1
nine	1
obstacles	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
the	1
stream	1
a	1
big	1
and	1
solid	1
barrier	1
five	1
feet	1
high	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
pavilion	1
a	1
dry	1
ditch	1
a	1
ditch	1
full	1
of	1
water	1
a	1
precipitous	1
slope	1
an	1
Irish	1
barricade	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
obstacles	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
mound	1
fenced	1
with	1
brushwood	1
beyond	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
ditch	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
horse	1
had	1
to	1
clear	1
both	1
obstacles	1
or	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
then	1
two	1
more	1
ditches	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
and	1
one	1
dry	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
was	1
just	1
facing	1
the	1
pavilion	1
But	1
the	1
race	1
began	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
ring	1
but	1
two	1
hundred	1
yards	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
obstacle	1
a	1
dammed	1
up	1
stream	1
seven	1
feet	1
in	1
breadth	1
which	1
the	1
racers	1
could	1
leap	1
or	1
wade	1
through	1
as	1
they	1
preferred	1
Three	1
times	1
they	1
were	1
ranged	1
ready	1
to	1
start	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
some	1
horse	1
thrust	1
itself	1
out	1
of	1
line	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
begin	1
again	1
The	1
umpire	1
who	1
was	1
starting	1
them	1
Colonel	1
Sestrin	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
temper	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
for	1
the	1
fourth	1
time	1
he	1
shouted	1
Away	1
and	1
the	1
racers	1
started	1
Every	1
eye	1
every	1
opera	1
glass	1
was	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
brightly	1
colored	1
group	1
of	1
riders	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
line	1
to	1
start	1
They	1
re	1
off	1
They	1
re	1
starting	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
after	1
the	1
hush	1
of	1
expectation	1
And	1
little	1
groups	1
and	1
solitary	1
figures	1
among	1
the	1
public	1
began	1
running	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
better	1
view	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
minute	1
the	1
close	1
group	1
of	1
horsemen	1
drew	1
out	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
approaching	1
the	1
stream	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
and	1
one	1
behind	1
another	1
To	1
the	1
spectators	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
started	1
simultaneously	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
racers	1
there	1
were	1
seconds	1
of	1
difference	1
that	1
had	1
great	1
value	1
to	1
them	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
excited	1
and	1
over	1
nervous	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
and	1
several	1
horses	1
had	1
started	1
before	1
her	1
but	1
before	1
reaching	1
the	1
stream	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
the	1
mare	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
force	1
as	1
she	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
bridle	1
easily	1
overtook	1
three	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
Mahotin	1
s	1
chestnut	1
Gladiator	1
whose	1
hind	1
quarters	1
were	1
moving	1
lightly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
exactly	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
dainty	1
mare	1
Diana	1
bearing	1
Kuzovlev	1
more	1
dead	1
than	1
alive	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
master	1
either	1
of	1
himself	1
or	1
his	1
mare	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
obstacle	1
the	1
stream	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
guide	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
his	1
mare	1
Gladiator	1
and	1
Diana	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
together	1
and	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
simultaneously	1
they	1
rose	1
above	1
the	1
stream	1
and	1
flew	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
darted	1
after	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
flying	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
he	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
almost	1
under	1
his	1
mare	1
s	1
hoofs	1
Kuzovlev	1
who	1
was	1
floundering	1
with	1
Diana	1
on	1
the	1
further	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
Kuzovlev	1
had	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
reins	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
leap	1
and	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
flying	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
Those	1
details	1
Vronsky	1
learned	1
later	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
all	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
that	1
just	1
under	1
him	1
where	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
must	1
alight	1
Diana	1
s	1
legs	1
or	1
head	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
But	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
drew	1
up	1
her	1
legs	1
and	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
leaping	1
like	1
a	1
falling	1
cat	1
and	1
clearing	1
the	1
other	1
mare	1
alighted	1
beyond	1
her	1
O	1
the	1
darling	1
thought	1
Vronsky	1
After	1
crossing	1
the	1
stream	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
mare	1
and	1
began	1
holding	1
her	1
in	1
intending	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
great	1
barrier	1
behind	1
Mahotin	1
and	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
overtake	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
ground	1
of	1
about	1
five	1
hundred	1
yards	1
that	1
followed	1
it	1
The	1
great	1
barrier	1
stood	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
imperial	1
pavilion	1
The	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
court	1
and	1
crowds	1
of	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
gazing	1
at	1
them	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
Mahotin	1
a	1
length	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
devil	1
as	1
the	1
solid	1
barrier	1
was	1
called	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
those	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
upon	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
except	1
the	1
ears	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mare	1
the	1
ground	1
racing	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
white	1
legs	1
of	1
Gladiator	1
beating	1
time	1
swiftly	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
keeping	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
distance	1
ahead	1
Gladiator	1
rose	1
with	1
no	1
sound	1
of	1
knocking	1
against	1
anything	1
With	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
short	1
tail	1
he	1
disappeared	1
from	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
sight	1
Bravo	1
cried	1
a	1
voice	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
under	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
right	1
before	1
him	1
flashed	1
the	1
palings	1
of	1
the	1
barrier	1
Without	1
the	1
slightest	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
action	1
his	1
mare	1
flew	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
palings	1
vanished	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
only	1
a	1
crash	1
behind	1
him	1
The	1
mare	1
excited	1
by	1
Gladiator	1
s	1
keeping	1
ahead	1
had	1
risen	1
too	1
soon	1
before	1
the	1
barrier	1
and	1
grazed	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
hind	1
hoofs	1
But	1
her	1
pace	1
never	1
changed	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
feeling	1
a	1
spatter	1
of	1
mud	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
same	1
distance	1
from	1
Gladiator	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
perceived	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
back	1
and	1
short	1
tail	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
swiftly	1
moving	1
white	1
legs	1
that	1
got	1
no	1
further	1
away	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
Vronsky	1
thought	1
that	1
now	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
overtake	1
Mahotin	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
herself	1
understanding	1
his	1
thoughts	1
without	1
any	1
incitement	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
gained	1
ground	1
considerably	1
and	1
began	1
getting	1
alongside	1
of	1
Mahotin	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
side	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
inner	1
cord	1
Mahotin	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
that	1
side	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
hardly	1
formed	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
perhaps	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
side	1
when	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
shifted	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
began	1
overtaking	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
s	1
shoulder	1
beginning	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
dark	1
with	1
sweat	1
was	1
even	1
with	1
Gladiator	1
s	1
back	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
lengths	1
they	1
moved	1
evenly	1
But	1
before	1
the	1
obstacle	1
they	1
were	1
approaching	1
Vronsky	1
began	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
having	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
outer	1
circle	1
and	1
swiftly	1
passed	1
Mahotin	1
just	1
upon	1
the	1
declivity	1
He	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
his	1
mud	1
stained	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
flashed	1
by	1
He	1
even	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
smiled	1
Vronsky	1
passed	1
Mahotin	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
immediately	1
aware	1
of	1
him	1
close	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
ceased	1
hearing	1
the	1
even	1
thudding	1
hoofs	1
and	1
the	1
rapid	1
and	1
still	1
quite	1
fresh	1
breathing	1
of	1
Gladiator	1
The	1
next	1
two	1
obstacles	1
the	1
water	1
course	1
and	1
the	1
barrier	1
were	1
easily	1
crossed	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
began	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
snorting	1
and	1
thud	1
of	1
Gladiator	1
closer	1
upon	1
him	1
He	1
urged	1
on	1
his	1
mare	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
delight	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
easily	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
Gladiator	1
s	1
hoofs	1
was	1
again	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
distance	1
away	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
as	1
Cord	1
had	1
advised	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
winner	1
His	1
excitement	1
his	1
delight	1
and	1
his	1
tenderness	1
for	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
grew	1
keener	1
and	1
keener	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
again	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
cool	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
urge	1
on	1
his	1
mare	1
so	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
same	1
reserve	1
of	1
force	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
Gladiator	1
still	1
kept	1
There	1
remained	1
only	1
one	1
obstacle	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
cross	1
it	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
first	1
He	1
was	1
flying	1
towards	1
the	1
Irish	1
barricade	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
and	1
he	1
both	1
together	1
saw	1
the	1
barricade	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
hesitation	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
in	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
ears	1
and	1
lifted	1
the	1
whip	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
fears	1
were	1
groundless	1
the	1
mare	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
wanted	1
She	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
rose	1
smoothly	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fancied	1
she	1
would	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
ground	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
her	1
rush	1
which	1
carried	1
her	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
ditch	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
rhythm	1
without	1
effort	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
leg	1
forward	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
fell	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
pace	1
again	1
Bravo	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
heard	1
shouts	1
from	1
a	1
knot	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
knew	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
who	1
were	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
obstacle	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
recognize	1
Yashvin	1
s	1
voice	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
O	1
my	1
sweet	1
he	1
said	1
inwardly	1
to	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
behind	1
He	1
s	1
cleared	1
it	1
he	1
thought	1
catching	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
Gladiator	1
s	1
hoofs	1
behind	1
him	1
There	1
remained	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
ditch	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
and	1
five	1
feet	1
wide	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
first	1
began	1
sawing	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
lifting	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
letting	1
it	1
go	1
in	1
time	1
with	1
her	1
paces	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
mare	1
was	1
at	1
her	1
very	1
last	1
reserve	1
of	1
strength	1
not	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
merely	1
were	1
wet	1
but	1
the	1
sweat	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
drops	1
on	1
her	1
mane	1
her	1
head	1
her	1
sharp	1
ears	1
and	1
her	1
breath	1
came	1
in	1
short	1
sharp	1
gasps	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
strength	1
left	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
remaining	1
five	1
hundred	1
yards	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
feeling	1
himself	1
nearer	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
peculiar	1
smoothness	1
of	1
his	1
motion	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
how	1
greatly	1
the	1
mare	1
had	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
She	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
ditch	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
noticing	1
it	1
She	1
flew	1
over	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
his	1
horror	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
mare	1
s	1
pace	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
made	1
a	1
fearful	1
unpardonable	1
mistake	1
in	1
recovering	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
position	1
had	1
shifted	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
something	1
awful	1
had	1
happened	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
when	1
the	1
white	1
legs	1
of	1
a	1
chestnut	1
horse	1
flashed	1
by	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
Mahotin	1
passed	1
at	1
a	1
swift	1
gallop	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
touching	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
sinking	1
on	1
that	1
foot	1
He	1
just	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
free	1
his	1
leg	1
when	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
gasping	1
painfully	1
and	1
making	1
vain	1
efforts	1
to	1
rise	1
with	1
her	1
delicate	1
soaking	1
neck	1
she	1
fluttered	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
a	1
shot	1
bird	1
The	1
clumsy	1
movement	1
made	1
by	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
broken	1
her	1
back	1
But	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
knew	1
much	1
later	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
knew	1
only	1
that	1
Mahotin	1
had	1
flown	1
swiftly	1
by	1
while	1
he	1
stood	1
staggering	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1
muddy	1
motionless	1
ground	1
and	1
Frou	1
Frou	1
lay	1
gasping	1
before	1
him	1
bending	1
her	1
head	1
back	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
exquisite	1
eyes	1
Still	1
unable	1
to	1
realize	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
Vronsky	1
tugged	1
at	1
his	1
mare	1
s	1
reins	1
Again	1
she	1
struggled	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
and	1
her	1
shoulders	1
setting	1
the	1
saddle	1
heaving	1
she	1
rose	1
on	1
her	1
front	1
legs	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
lift	1
her	1
back	1
she	1
quivered	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
again	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
With	1
a	1
face	1
hideous	1
with	1
passion	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembling	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
white	1
Vronsky	1
kicked	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
heel	1
in	1
the	1
stomach	1
and	1
again	1
fell	1
to	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
rein	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
but	1
thrusting	1
her	1
nose	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
she	1
simply	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
master	1
with	1
her	1
speaking	1
eyes	1
A	1
a	1
a	1
groaned	1
Vronsky	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
Ah	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
he	1
cried	1
The	1
race	1
lost	1
And	1
my	1
fault	1
shameful	1
unpardonable	1
And	1
the	1
poor	1
darling	1
ruined	1
mare	1
Ah	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
A	1
crowd	1
of	1
men	1
a	1
doctor	1
and	1
his	1
assistant	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
To	1
his	1
misery	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
whole	1
and	1
unhurt	1
The	1
mare	1
had	1
broken	1
her	1
back	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
shoot	1
her	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
questions	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
anyone	1
He	1
turned	1
and	1
without	1
picking	1
up	1
his	1
cap	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
off	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
He	1
felt	1
utterly	1
wretched	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
bitterest	1
sort	1
of	1
misfortune	1
misfortune	1
beyond	1
remedy	1
and	1
caused	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
fault	1
Yashvin	1
overtook	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
home	1
and	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
regained	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
But	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
that	1
race	1
remained	1
for	1
long	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
the	1
cruelest	1
and	1
bitterest	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
Chapter	1
26	1
The	1
external	1
relations	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
remained	1
unchanged	1
The	1
sole	1
difference	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
busily	1
occupied	1
than	1
ever	1
As	1
in	1
former	1
years	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
foreign	1
watering	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
health	1
deranged	1
by	1
the	1
winter	1
s	1
work	1
that	1
every	1
year	1
grew	1
heavier	1
And	1
just	1
as	1
always	1
he	1
returned	1
in	1
July	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
fell	1
to	1
work	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
increased	1
energy	1
As	1
usual	1
too	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
moved	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
to	1
a	1
villa	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
while	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
From	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
after	1
the	1
party	1
at	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
again	1
to	1
Anna	1
of	1
his	1
suspicions	1
and	1
his	1
jealousies	1
and	1
that	1
habitual	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
bantering	1
mimicry	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
convenient	1
tone	1
possible	1
for	1
his	1
present	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
colder	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
He	1
simply	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
slightly	1
displeased	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
that	1
first	1
midnight	1
conversation	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
repelled	1
In	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
vexation	1
but	1
nothing	1
more	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
open	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
mentally	1
addressing	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you	1
Now	1
you	1
may	1
beg	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
but	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
open	1
with	1
you	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
mentally	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
after	1
vainly	1
attempting	1
to	1
extinguish	1
a	1
fire	1
should	1
fly	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
with	1
his	1
vain	1
efforts	1
and	1
say	1
Oh	1
very	1
well	1
then	1
you	1
shall	1
burn	1
for	1
this	1
This	1
man	1
so	1
subtle	1
and	1
astute	1
in	1
official	1
life	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
all	1
the	1
senselessness	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
it	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
terrible	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
realize	1
his	1
actual	1
position	1
and	1
he	1
shut	1
down	1
and	1
locked	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
secret	1
place	1
where	1
lay	1
hid	1
his	1
feelings	1
towards	1
his	1
family	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
son	1
He	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
careful	1
father	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
winter	1
become	1
peculiarly	1
frigid	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
adopted	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
bantering	1
tone	1
he	1
used	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Aha	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
greeting	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
met	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
asserted	1
and	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
any	1
previous	1
year	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
official	1
business	1
as	1
that	1
year	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
work	1
for	1
himself	1
that	1
year	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
for	1
keeping	1
shut	1
that	1
secret	1
place	1
where	1
lay	1
hid	1
his	1
feelings	1
towards	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
about	1
them	1
which	1
became	1
more	1
terrible	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
lay	1
there	1
If	1
anyone	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
ask	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
behavior	1
the	1
mild	1
and	1
peaceable	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
angered	1
with	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
should	1
question	1
him	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
For	1
this	1
reason	1
there	1
positively	1
came	1
into	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
face	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
haughtiness	1
and	1
severity	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
inquired	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
health	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
at	1
all	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
behavior	1
and	1
he	1
actually	1
succeeded	1
in	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
permanent	1
summer	1
villa	1
was	1
in	1
Peterhof	1
and	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer	1
there	1
close	1
to	1
Anna	1
and	1
constantly	1
seeing	1
her	1
That	1
year	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
declined	1
to	1
settle	1
in	1
Peterhof	1
was	1
not	1
once	1
at	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
s	1
and	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
hinted	1
at	1
the	1
unsuitability	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
close	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Betsy	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sternly	1
cut	1
her	1
short	1
roundly	1
declaring	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
be	1
above	1
suspicion	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
began	1
to	1
avoid	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
society	1
cast	1
dubious	1
glances	1
on	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
so	1
particularly	1
insisted	1
on	1
staying	1
at	1
Tsarskoe	1
where	1
Betsy	1
was	1
staying	1
and	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
regiment	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
admitted	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
proofs	1
not	1
even	1
suspicious	1
evidence	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
knew	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
deceived	1
husband	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
profoundly	1
miserable	1
about	1
it	1
How	1
often	1
during	1
those	1
eight	1
years	1
of	1
happy	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
other	1
men	1
s	1
faithless	1
wives	1
and	1
other	1
deceived	1
husbands	1
and	1
asked	1
himself	1
How	1
can	1
people	1
descend	1
to	1
that	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
hideous	1
position	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
misfortune	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
thinking	1
of	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
recognize	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
would	1
not	1
recognize	1
it	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
awful	1
too	1
unnatural	1
Since	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
abroad	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
twice	1
been	1
at	1
their	1
country	1
villa	1
Once	1
he	1
dined	1
there	1
another	1
time	1
he	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
friends	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
stayed	1
the	1
night	1
there	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
habit	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
previous	1
years	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
busy	1
day	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
but	1
when	1
mentally	1
sketching	1
out	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
country	1
house	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
immediately	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
Court	1
were	1
to	1
witness	1
and	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
once	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
appearances	1
And	1
besides	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
wife	1
some	1
money	1
for	1
her	1
expenses	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
usual	1
arrangement	1
With	1
his	1
habitual	1
control	1
over	1
his	1
thoughts	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
all	1
this	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
his	1
thoughts	1
stray	1
further	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
That	1
morning	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
full	1
one	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
The	1
evening	1
before	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
pamphlet	1
by	1
a	1
celebrated	1
traveler	1
in	1
China	1
who	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
she	1
enclosed	1
a	1
note	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
traveler	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
extremely	1
interesting	1
person	1
from	1
various	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
pamphlet	1
through	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
finished	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Then	1
people	1
began	1
arriving	1
with	1
petitions	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
reports	1
interviews	1
appointments	1
dismissals	1
apportionment	1
of	1
rewards	1
pensions	1
grants	1
notes	1
the	1
workaday	1
round	1
as	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
called	1
it	1
that	1
always	1
took	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
private	1
business	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
who	1
managed	1
his	1
property	1
The	1
steward	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
much	1
time	1
He	1
simply	1
gave	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
needed	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
brief	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
his	1
affairs	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
satisfactory	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
during	1
that	1
year	1
owing	1
to	1
increased	1
expenses	1
more	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
out	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deficit	1
But	1
the	1
doctor	1
a	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
doctor	1
who	1
was	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
time	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
was	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
visit	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
doctor	1
questioned	1
him	1
very	1
carefully	1
about	1
his	1
health	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
breathing	1
and	1
tapped	1
at	1
his	1
liver	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
usual	1
that	1
year	1
had	1
begged	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
examine	1
him	1
Do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
Russia	1
countess	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor	1
A	1
priceless	1
man	1
said	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
extremely	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
He	1
found	1
the	1
liver	1
considerably	1
enlarged	1
and	1
the	1
digestive	1
powers	1
weakened	1
while	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
mineral	1
waters	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
without	1
effect	1
He	1
prescribed	1
more	1
physical	1
exercise	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
less	1
mental	1
strain	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
no	1
worry	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
power	1
as	1
abstaining	1
from	1
breathing	1
Then	1
he	1
withdrew	1
leaving	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
sense	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
curing	1
it	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
away	1
the	1
doctor	1
chanced	1
to	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
staircase	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
his	1
Sludin	1
who	1
was	1
secretary	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
department	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
comrades	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
rarely	1
met	1
they	1
thought	1
highly	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
were	1
excellent	1
friends	1
and	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
doctor	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
a	1
patient	1
so	1
freely	1
as	1
to	1
Sludin	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
said	1
Sludin	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
well	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
beckoning	1
over	1
Sludin	1
s	1
head	1
to	1
his	1
coachman	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
carriage	1
round	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
this	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
taking	1
a	1
finger	1
of	1
his	1
kid	1
glove	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
hands	1
and	1
pulling	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
strain	1
the	1
strings	1
and	1
then	1
try	1
to	1
break	1
them	1
you	1
ll	1
find	1
it	1
a	1
difficult	1
job	1
but	1
strain	1
a	1
string	1
to	1
its	1
very	1
utmost	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
weight	1
of	1
one	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
strained	1
string	1
will	1
snap	1
it	1
And	1
with	1
his	1
close	1
assiduity	1
his	1
conscientious	1
devotion	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
s	1
strained	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
some	1
outside	1
burden	1
weighing	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
light	1
one	1
concluded	1
the	1
doctor	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
significantly	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
Yes	1
yes	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
does	1
waste	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
doctor	1
responded	1
vaguely	1
to	1
some	1
reply	1
of	1
Sludin	1
s	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
caught	1
Directly	1
after	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
came	1
the	1
celebrated	1
traveler	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
pamphlet	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
finished	1
reading	1
and	1
his	1
previous	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
subject	1
impressed	1
the	1
traveler	1
by	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
traveler	1
there	1
was	1
announced	1
a	1
provincial	1
marshal	1
of	1
nobility	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
whom	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
conversation	1
After	1
his	1
departure	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
daily	1
routine	1
of	1
business	1
with	1
his	1
secretary	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
still	1
had	1
to	1
drive	1
round	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
great	1
personage	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
grave	1
and	1
serious	1
import	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
only	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
by	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
his	1
dinner	1
hour	1
and	1
after	1
dining	1
with	1
his	1
secretary	1
he	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
villa	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
races	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
always	1
tried	1
nowadays	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
person	1
in	1
his	1
interviews	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Chapter	1
27	1
Anna	1
was	1
upstairs	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
with	1
Annushka	1
s	1
assistance	1
pinning	1
the	1
last	1
ribbon	1
on	1
her	1
gown	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
crunching	1
the	1
gravel	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
It	1
s	1
too	1
early	1
for	1
Betsy	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
hat	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
sticking	1
up	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
How	1
unlucky	1
Can	1
he	1
be	1
going	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
wondered	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
might	1
come	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
chance	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
so	1
awful	1
and	1
terrible	1
that	1
without	1
dwelling	1
on	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
and	1
radiant	1
face	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
falsehood	1
and	1
deceit	1
in	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
late	1
she	1
abandoned	1
herself	1
to	1
that	1
spirit	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
Ah	1
how	1
nice	1
of	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
her	1
husband	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
greeting	1
Sludin	1
who	1
was	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
You	1
re	1
staying	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
hope	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
word	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
falsehood	1
prompted	1
her	1
to	1
utter	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
together	1
Only	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
I	1
ve	1
promised	1
Betsy	1
She	1
s	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
knit	1
his	1
brows	1
at	1
Betsy	1
s	1
name	1
Oh	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
separate	1
the	1
inseparables	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
bantering	1
tone	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
with	1
Mihail	1
Vassilievitch	1
I	1
m	1
ordered	1
exercise	1
by	1
the	1
doctors	1
too	1
I	1
ll	1
walk	1
and	1
fancy	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
again	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
hurry	1
said	1
Anna	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
tea	1
She	1
rang	1
Bring	1
in	1
tea	1
and	1
tell	1
Seryozha	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
is	1
here	1
Well	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
Mihail	1
Vassilievitch	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
before	1
Look	1
how	1
lovely	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
She	1
spoke	1
very	1
simply	1
and	1
naturally	1
but	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
too	1
fast	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
from	1
noticing	1
in	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
look	1
Mihail	1
Vassilievitch	1
turned	1
on	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
keeping	1
watch	1
on	1
her	1
Mihail	1
Vassilievitch	1
promptly	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
husband	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
look	1
quite	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
Yes	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
today	1
and	1
wasted	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
my	1
time	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
someone	1
of	1
our	1
friends	1
must	1
have	1
sent	1
him	1
my	1
health	1
s	1
so	1
precious	1
it	1
seems	1
No	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
She	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
rest	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
All	1
this	1
she	1
said	1
brightly	1
rapidly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
brilliance	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
But	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
attach	1
any	1
special	1
significance	1
to	1
this	1
tone	1
of	1
hers	1
He	1
heard	1
only	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
only	1
the	1
direct	1
sense	1
they	1
bore	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
simply	1
though	1
jestingly	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
conversation	1
but	1
never	1
after	1
could	1
Anna	1
recall	1
this	1
brief	1
scene	1
without	1
an	1
agonizing	1
pang	1
of	1
shame	1
Seryozha	1
came	1
in	1
preceded	1
by	1
his	1
governess	1
If	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
observe	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
noticed	1
the	1
timid	1
and	1
bewildered	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
Seryozha	1
glanced	1
first	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
anything	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it	1
Ah	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
He	1
s	1
grown	1
Really	1
he	1
s	1
getting	1
quite	1
a	1
man	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
young	1
man	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
scared	1
child	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
been	1
shy	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
before	1
and	1
now	1
ever	1
since	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
calling	1
him	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
insoluble	1
question	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
whether	1
Vronsky	1
were	1
a	1
friend	1
or	1
a	1
foe	1
he	1
avoided	1
his	1
father	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
towards	1
his	1
mother	1
as	1
though	1
seeking	1
shelter	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
ease	1
Meanwhile	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
holding	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
governess	1
and	1
Seryozha	1
was	1
so	1
miserably	1
uncomfortable	1
that	1
Anna	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
tears	1
Anna	1
who	1
had	1
flushed	1
a	1
little	1
the	1
instant	1

up	1
hurriedly	1
took	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
hand	1
from	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
shoulder	1
and	1
kissing	1
the	1
boy	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
quickly	1
came	1
back	1
It	1
s	1

to	1
start	1

said	1
she	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
Betsy	1
doesn	1
t	1

Yes	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
folded	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
cracked	1
his	1
fingers	1
I	1
ve	1

money	1

You	1

No	1
I	1

I	1

she	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
crimsoning	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
her	1
hair	1
But	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
back	1
here	1
after	1
the	1
races	1
I	1
suppose	1
Oh	1
yes	1
answered	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
And	1
here	1
s	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Peterhof	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
he	1
added	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
elegant	1
English	1
carriage	1
with	1
the	1
tiny	1
seats	1
placed	1
extremely	1
high	1
What	1
elegance	1
Charming	1
Well	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
starting	1
too	1
then	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
carriage	1
but	1
her	1
groom	1
in	1
high	1
boots	1
a	1
cape	1
and	1
black	1
hat	1
darted	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
good	1
bye	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
was	1
ever	1
so	1
nice	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
Well	1
au	1

then	1
You	1
ll	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
some	1
tea	1
that	1
s	1
delightful	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
gay	1
and	1
radiant	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
saw	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
on	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
his	1
lips	1
had	1
touched	1
and	1
she	1
shuddered	1
with	1
repulsion	1
Chapter	1
28	1
When	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
reached	1
the	1
race	1
course	1
Anna	1
was	1
already	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
pavilion	1
beside	1
Betsy	1
in	1
that	1
pavilion	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
had	1
gathered	1
She	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
Two	1
men	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
lover	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
centers	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
and	1
unaided	1
by	1
her	1
external	1
senses	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
their	1
nearness	1
She	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
approaching	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
following	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
surging	1
crowd	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
moving	1
She	1
watched	1
his	1
progress	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilion	1
saw	1
him	1
now	1
responding	1
condescendingly	1
to	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
bow	1
now	1
exchanging	1
friendly	1
nonchalant	1
greetings	1
with	1
his	1
equals	1
now	1
assiduously	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
big	1
round	1
hat	1
that	1
squeezed	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
ears	1
All	1
these	1
ways	1
of	1
his	1
she	1
knew	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
hateful	1
to	1
her	1
Nothing	1
but	1
ambition	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
for	1
these	1
lofty	1
ideals	1
love	1
of	1
culture	1
religion	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
so	1
many	1
tools	1
for	1
getting	1
on	1
From	1
his	1
glances	1
towards	1
the	1
ladies	1
pavilion	1
he	1
was	1
staring	1
straight	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
distinguish	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
muslin	1
ribbons	1
feathers	1
parasols	1
and	1
flowers	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
purposely	1
avoided	1
noticing	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
m	1
sure	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
your	1
wife	1
here	1
she	1
is	1
He	1
smiled	1
his	1
chilly	1
smile	1
There	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
splendor	1
here	1
that	1
one	1
s	1
eyes	1
are	1
dazzled	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
pavilion	1
He	1
smiled	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
smile	1
on	1
meeting	1
his	1
wife	1
after	1
only	1
just	1
parting	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
greeted	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
other	1
acquaintances	1
giving	1
to	1
each	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
jesting	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
dealing	1
out	1
friendly	1
greetings	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
Below	1
near	1
the	1
pavilion	1
was	1
standing	1
an	1
adjutant	1
general	1
of	1
whom	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
a	1
high	1
opinion	1
noted	1
for	1
his	1
intelligence	1
and	1
culture	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
interval	1
between	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
so	1
nothing	1
hindered	1
conversation	1
The	1
adjutant	1
general	1
expressed	1
his	1
disapproval	1
of	1
races	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
replied	1
defending	1
them	1
Anna	1
heard	1
his	1
high	1
measured	1
tones	1
not	1
losing	1
one	1
word	1
and	1
every	1
word	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
false	1
and	1
stabbed	1
her	1
ears	1
with	1
pain	1
When	1
the	1
three	1
mile	1
steeplechase	1
was	1
beginning	1
she	1
bent	1
forward	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
mounted	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
loathsome	1
never	1
ceasing	1
voice	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
terror	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
agony	1
was	1
the	1
never	1
ceasing	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
stream	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
shrill	1
voice	1
with	1
its	1
familiar	1
intonations	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
wicked	1
woman	1
a	1
lost	1
woman	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
lying	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
endure	1
falsehood	1
while	1
as	1
for	1
him	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
falsehood	1
He	1
knows	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
sees	1
it	1
all	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
care	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
talk	1
so	1
calmly	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
kill	1
me	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
kill	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
might	1
respect	1
him	1
No	1
all	1
he	1
wants	1
is	1
falsehood	1
and	1
propriety	1
Anna	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
not	1
considering	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
wanted	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
behave	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
either	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
peculiar	1
loquacity	1
that	1
day	1
so	1
exasperating	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
inward	1
distress	1
and	1
uneasiness	1
As	1
a	1
child	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
hurt	1
skips	1
about	1
putting	1
all	1
his	1
muscles	1
into	1
movement	1
to	1
drown	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
needed	1
mental	1
exercise	1
to	1
drown	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
and	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
continual	1
iteration	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
would	1
force	1
themselves	1
on	1
his	1
attention	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
natural	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
well	1
and	1
cleverly	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
natural	1
for	1
a	1
child	1
to	1
skip	1
about	1
He	1
was	1
saying	1
Danger	1
in	1
the	1
races	1
of	1
officers	1
of	1
cavalry	1
men	1
is	1
an	1
essential	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
race	1
If	1
England	1
can	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
brilliant	1
feats	1
of	1
cavalry	1
in	1
military	1
history	1
it	1
is	1
simply	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
historically	1
developed	1
this	1
force	1
both	1
in	1
beasts	1
and	1
in	1
men	1
Sport	1
has	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
a	1
great	1
value	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
we	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
superficial	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
superficial	1
said	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
they	1
say	1
has	1
broken	1
two	1
ribs	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
his	1
smile	1
which	1
uncovered	1
his	1
teeth	1
but	1
revealed	1
nothing	1
more	1
We	1
ll	1
admit	1
princess	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
superficial	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
internal	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
seriously	1
we	1
mustn	1
t	1
forget	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
race	1
are	1
military	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
chosen	1
that	1
career	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
allow	1
that	1
every	1
calling	1
has	1
its	1
disagreeable	1
side	1
It	1
forms	1
an	1
integral	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
an	1
officer	1
Low	1
sports	1
such	1
as	1
prize	1
fighting	1
or	1
Spanish	1
bull	1
fights	1
are	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
barbarity	1
But	1
specialized	1
trials	1
of	1
skill	1
are	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
development	1
No	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
come	1
another	1
time	1

Princess	1

Isn	1

Anna	1
It	1
is	1
upsetting	1
but	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
tear	1
oneself	1
away	1
said	1
another	1
lady	1
If	1
I	1
d	1
been	1
a	1
Roman	1
woman	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
missed	1
a	1
single	1
circus	1
Anna	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
keeping	1
her	1
opera	1
glass	1
up	1
gazed	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
tall	1
general	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
pavilion	1
Breaking	1
off	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
got	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
though	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
bowed	1
low	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
racing	1
the	1
officer	1
asked	1
chaffing	1
him	1
My	1
race	1
is	1
a	1
harder	1
one	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
responded	1
deferentially	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
answer	1
meant	1
nothing	1
the	1
general	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
a	1
witty	1
remark	1
from	1
a	1
witty	1
man	1
and	1
fully	1
relished	1
la	1
pointe	1
de	1
la	1
sauce	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
aspects	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
resumed	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
part	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
look	1
on	1
and	1
love	1
for	1
such	1
spectacles	1
is	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
proof	1
of	1
a	1
low	1
degree	1
of	1
development	1
in	1
the	1
spectator	1
I	1
admit	1
but	1
Princess	1
bets	1
sounded	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
voice	1
from	1
below	1
addressing	1
Betsy	1
Who	1
s	1
your	1
favorite	1
Anna	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
for	1
Kuzovlev	1
replied	1
Betsy	1
I	1
m	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
A	1
pair	1
of	1
gloves	1
Done	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pretty	1
sight	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
paused	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
directly	1
I	1
admit	1
that	1
manly	1
sports	1
do	1
not	1
he	1
was	1
continuing	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
racers	1
started	1
and	1
all	1
conversation	1
ceased	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
too	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
everyone	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
turned	1
towards	1
the	1
stream	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
race	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
watch	1
the	1
racers	1
but	1
fell	1
listlessly	1
to	1
scanning	1
the	1
spectators	1
with	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
His	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
Anna	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
set	1
She	1
was	1
obviously	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
one	1
man	1
Her	1
hand	1
had	1
convulsively	1
clutched	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
she	1
held	1
her	1
breath	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
hastily	1
turned	1
away	1
scrutinizing	1
other	1
faces	1
But	1
here	1
s	1
this	1
lady	1
too	1
and	1
others	1
very	1
much	1
moved	1
as	1
well	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
natural	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
told	1
himself	1
He	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
drawn	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
examined	1
that	1
face	1
again	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
read	1
what	1
was	1
so	1
plainly	1
written	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
with	1
horror	1
read	1
on	1
it	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
The	1
first	1
fall	1
Kuzovlev	1
s	1
at	1
the	1
stream	1
agitated	1
everyone	1
but	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
on	1
Anna	1
s	1
pale	1
triumphant	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
she	1

fallen	1
When	1
after	1
Mahotin	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
cleared	1
the	1
worst	1
barrier	1
the	1
next	1
officer	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
fatally	1
injured	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
horror	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
public	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
notice	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
difficulty	1
in	1
realizing	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
about	1
her	1
But	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
and	1
with	1
greater	1
persistence	1
he	1
watched	1
her	1
Anna	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
race	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
cold	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
She	1
glanced	1
round	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
frown	1
turned	1
away	1
again	1
Ah	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
him	1
again	1
The	1
race	1
was	1
an	1
unlucky	1
one	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
seventeen	1
officers	1
who	1
rode	1
in	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
were	1
thrown	1
and	1
hurt	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
everyone	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
agitation	1
which	1
was	1
intensified	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Tsar	1
was	1
displeased	1
Chapter	1
29	1
Everyone	1
was	1
loudly	1
expressing	1
disapprobation	1
everyone	1
was	1
repeating	1
a	1
phrase	1
someone	1
had	1
uttered	1
The	1
lions	1
and	1
gladiators	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
and	1
everyone	1
was	1
feeling	1
horrified	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
Vronsky	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
Anna	1
moaned	1
aloud	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
very	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
it	1
But	1
afterwards	1
a	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
which	1
really	1
was	1
beyond	1
decorum	1
She	1
utterly	1
lost	1
her	1
head	1
She	1
began	1
fluttering	1
like	1
a	1
caged	1
bird	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
turned	1
to	1
Betsy	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
But	1
Betsy	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
bending	1
down	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
and	1
courteously	1
offered	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
but	1
Anna	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
her	1
husband	1
He	1
s	1
broken	1
his	1
leg	1
too	1
so	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
general	1
was	1
saying	1
This	1
is	1
beyond	1
everything	1
Without	1
answering	1
her	1
husband	1
Anna	1
lifted	1
her	1
opera	1
glass	1
and	1
gazed	1
towards	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
fallen	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
off	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
nothing	1
She	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
away	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
officer	1
galloped	1
up	1
and	1
made	1
some	1
announcement	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar	1
Anna	1
craned	1
forward	1
listening	1
Stiva	1
Stiva	1
she	1
cried	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
But	1
her	1
brother	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
Again	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
away	1
Once	1
more	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
arm	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
reaching	1
towards	1
her	1
hand	1
She	1
drew	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
with	1
aversion	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
answered	1
No	1
no	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
I	1
ll	1
stay	1
She	1
saw	1
now	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
accident	1
an	1
officer	1
was	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
pavilion	1
Betsy	1
waved	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
officer	1
brought	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
rider	1
was	1
not	1
killed	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
had	1
broken	1
its	1
back	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
Anna	1
sat	1
down	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
fan	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
weeping	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
her	1
tears	1
nor	1
even	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
were	1
shaking	1
her	1
bosom	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stood	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
screen	1
her	1
giving	1
her	1
time	1
to	1
recover	1
herself	1
For	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
arm	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
time	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
Anna	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
rescue	1
No	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
brought	1
Anna	1
and	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
home	1
put	1
in	1
Betsy	1
Excuse	1
me	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
courteously	1
but	1
looking	1
her	1
very	1
firmly	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
Anna	1
s	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
with	1
me	1
Anna	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
way	1
got	1
up	1
submissively	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
arm	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
and	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
Betsy	1
whispered	1
to	1
her	1
As	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
pavilion	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
always	1
talked	1
to	1
those	1
he	1
met	1
and	1
Anna	1
had	1
as	1
always	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
answer	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
beside	1
herself	1
and	1
moved	1
hanging	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
arm	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
Is	1
he	1
killed	1
or	1
not	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
Will	1
he	1
come	1
or	1
not	1
Shall	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
today	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
She	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
carriage	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
drove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
carriages	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
real	1
condition	1
He	1
merely	1
saw	1
the	1
outward	1
symptoms	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
behaving	1
unbecomingly	1
and	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
so	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
behaved	1
unbecomingly	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
something	1
utterly	1
different	1
What	1
an	1
inclination	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
though	1
for	1
these	1
cruel	1
spectacles	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
observe	1
Eh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
said	1
Anna	1
contemptuously	1
He	1
was	1
offended	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
obliged	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
began	1
So	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
out	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
frightened	1
I	1
am	1
obliged	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
behavior	1
has	1
been	1
unbecoming	1
today	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
French	1
In	1
what	1
way	1
has	1
my	1
behavior	1
been	1
unbecoming	1
she	1
said	1
aloud	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
swiftly	1
and	1
looking	1
him	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
bright	1
expression	1
that	1
seemed	1
covering	1
something	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
determination	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
concealed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
the	1
dismay	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
Mind	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
opposite	1
the	1
coachman	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
pulled	1
up	1
the	1
window	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
consider	1
unbecoming	1
she	1
repeated	1
The	1
despair	1
you	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
conceal	1
at	1
the	1
accident	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
riders	1
He	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
answer	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
begged	1
you	1
so	1
to	1
conduct	1
yourself	1
in	1
society	1
that	1
even	1
malicious	1
tongues	1
can	1
find	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
you	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
spoke	1
of	1
your	1
inward	1
attitude	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
that	1
now	1
Now	1
I	1
speak	1
only	1
of	1
your	1
external	1
attitude	1
You	1
have	1
behaved	1
improperly	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
wish	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
occur	1
again	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
she	1
felt	1
panic	1
stricken	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
thinking	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
killed	1
Was	1
it	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
when	1
they	1
said	1
the	1
rider	1
was	1
unhurt	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
had	1
broken	1
its	1
back	1
She	1
merely	1
smiled	1
with	1
a	1
pretense	1
of	1
irony	1
when	1
he	1
finished	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
boldly	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
realized	1
plainly	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
dismay	1
she	1
was	1
feeling	1
infected	1
him	1
too	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
misapprehension	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
She	1
is	1
smiling	1
at	1
my	1
suspicions	1
Yes	1
she	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
directly	1
what	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
before	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
foundation	1
for	1
my	1
suspicions	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
absurd	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
everything	1
was	1
hanging	1
over	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
he	1
expected	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
answer	1
mockingly	1
as	1
before	1
that	1
his	1
suspicions	1
were	1
absurd	1
and	1
utterly	1
groundless	1
So	1
terrible	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
anything	1
But	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
scared	1
and	1
gloomy	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
promise	1
even	1
deception	1
Possibly	1
I	1
was	1
mistaken	1
said	1
he	1
If	1
so	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
No	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
mistaken	1
she	1
said	1
deliberately	1
looking	1
desperately	1
into	1
his	1
cold	1
face	1
You	1
were	1
not	1
mistaken	1
I	1
was	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
in	1
despair	1
I	1
hear	1
you	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
mistress	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
hate	1
you	1
You	1
can	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
dropping	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
she	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
and	1
kept	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
But	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
suddenly	1
bore	1
the	1
solemn	1
rigidity	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
his	1
expression	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
drive	1
home	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
Very	1
well	1
But	1
I	1
expect	1
a	1
strict	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
external	1
forms	1
of	1
propriety	1
till	1
such	1
time	1
his	1
voice	1
shook	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
secure	1
my	1
honor	1
and	1
communicate	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
He	1
got	1
out	1
first	1
and	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
Before	1
the	1
servants	1
he	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
drove	1
back	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
Immediately	1
afterwards	1
a	1
footman	1
came	1
from	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
and	1
brought	1
Anna	1
a	1
note	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
Alexey	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
how	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
he	1
writes	1
me	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
unhurt	1
but	1
in	1
despair	1
So	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
she	1
thought	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
She	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
She	1
had	1
still	1
three	1
hours	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
their	1
last	1
meeting	1
set	1
her	1
blood	1
in	1
flame	1
My	1
God	1
how	1
light	1
it	1
is	1
It	1
s	1
dreadful	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
this	1

Chapter	1
30	1
In	1
the	1
little	1
German	1
watering	1
place	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
had	1
betaken	1
themselves	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
indeed	1
where	1
people	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
usual	1
process	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
crystallization	1
of	1
society	1
went	1
on	1
assigning	1
to	1
each	1
member	1
of	1
that	1
society	1
a	1
definite	1
and	1
unalterable	1
place	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
particle	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
frost	1
definitely	1
and	1
unalterably	1
takes	1
the	1
special	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
crystal	1
of	1
snow	1
so	1
each	1
new	1
person	1
that	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
placed	1
in	1
his	1
special	1
place	1
F"urst	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
sammt	1
Gemahlin	1
und	1
Tochter	1
by	1
the	1
apartments	1
they	1
took	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
name	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
friends	1
they	1
made	1
were	1
immediately	1
crystallized	1
into	1
a	1
definite	1
place	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
them	1
There	1
was	1
visiting	1
the	1
watering	1
place	1
that	1
year	1
a	1
real	1
German	1
F"urstin	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
crystallizing	1
process	1
went	1
on	1
more	1
vigorously	1
than	1
ever	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
wished	1
above	1
everything	1
to	1
present	1
her	1
daughter	1
to	1
this	1
German	1
princess	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
she	1
duly	1
performed	1
this	1
rite	1
Kitty	1
made	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
graceful	1
curtsey	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
simple	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
very	1
elegant	1
frock	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
her	1
from	1
Paris	1
The	1
German	1
princess	1
said	1
I	1
hope	1
the	1
roses	1
will	1
soon	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
this	1
pretty	1
little	1
face	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
certain	1
definite	1
lines	1
of	1
existence	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
laid	1
down	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
departing	1
The	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
too	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
Lady	1
Somebody	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
German	1
countess	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
war	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
learned	1
Swede	1
and	1
of	1
M	1
Canut	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
But	1
yet	1
inevitably	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
thrown	1
most	1
into	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
Moscow	1
lady	1
Marya	1
Yevgenyevna	1
Rtishtcheva	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
whom	1
Kitty	1
disliked	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
ill	1
like	1
herself	1
over	1
a	1
love	1
affair	1
and	1
a	1
Moscow	1
colonel	1
whom	1
Kitty	1
had	1
known	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
always	1
seen	1
in	1
uniform	1
and	1
epaulets	1
and	1
who	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
open	1
neck	1
and	1
flowered	1
cravat	1
was	1
uncommonly	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
tedious	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
When	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
firmly	1
established	1
Kitty	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
bored	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
Carlsbad	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
She	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
knew	1
feeling	1
that	1
nothing	1
fresh	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
them	1
Her	1
chief	1
mental	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
watering	1
place	1
consisted	1
in	1
watching	1
and	1
making	1
theories	1
about	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
It	1
was	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Kitty	1
that	1
she	1
always	1
imagined	1
everything	1
in	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
light	1
possible	1
especially	1
so	1
in	1
those	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
And	1
now	1
as	1
she	1
made	1
surmises	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
people	1
were	1
what	1
were	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
Kitty	1
endowed	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
marvelous	1
and	1
noble	1
characters	1
and	1
found	1
confirmation	1
of	1
her	1
idea	1
in	1
her	1
observations	1
Of	1
these	1
people	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
attracted	1
her	1
most	1
was	1
a	1
Russian	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
watering	1
place	1
with	1
an	1
invalid	1
Russian	1
lady	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
as	1
everyone	1
called	1
her	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
and	1
only	1
on	1
exceptionally	1
fine	1
days	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
in	1
an	1
invalid	1
carriage	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
ill	1
health	1
as	1
from	1
pride	1
so	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
interpreted	1
it	1
that	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
anyone	1
among	1
the	1
Russians	1
there	1
The	1
Russian	1
girl	1
looked	1
after	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
besides	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
Kitty	1
observed	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
invalids	1
who	1
were	1
seriously	1
ill	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
way	1
This	1
Russian	1
girl	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
Kitty	1
gathered	1
related	1
to	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
nor	1
was	1
she	1
a	1
paid	1
attendant	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
called	1
her	1
Varenka	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
called	1
her	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
interest	1
Kitty	1
took	1
in	1
this	1
girl	1
s	1
relations	1
with	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
unknown	1
persons	1
Kitty	1
as	1
often	1
happened	1
felt	1
an	1
inexplicable	1
attraction	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
and	1
was	1
aware	1
when	1
their	1
eyes	1
met	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
liked	1
her	1
Of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
one	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
her	1
first	1
youth	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
creature	1
without	1
youth	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
nineteen	1
or	1
for	1
thirty	1
If	1
her	1
features	1
were	1
criticized	1
separately	1
she	1
was	1
handsome	1
rather	1
than	1
plain	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
sickly	1
hue	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
figure	1
too	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
her	1
extreme	1
thinness	1
and	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
which	1
was	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
her	1
medium	1
height	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
attractive	1
to	1
men	1
She	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
fine	1
flower	1
already	1
past	1
its	1
bloom	1
and	1
without	1
fragrance	1
though	1
the	1
petals	1
were	1
still	1
unwithered	1
Moreover	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unattractive	1
to	1
men	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
just	1
what	1
Kitty	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
of	1
the	1
suppressed	1
fire	1
of	1
vitality	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
attractiveness	1
She	1
always	1
seemed	1
absorbed	1
in	1
work	1
about	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
anything	1
outside	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
this	1
contrast	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
that	1
was	1
for	1
Kitty	1
the	1
great	1
attraction	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
painfully	1
seeking	1
interest	1
in	1
life	1
a	1
dignity	1
in	1
life	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
worldly	1
relations	1
of	1
girls	1
with	1
men	1
which	1
so	1
revolted	1
Kitty	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
shameful	1
hawking	1
about	1
of	1
goods	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
a	1
purchaser	1
The	1
more	1
attentively	1
Kitty	1
watched	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
she	1
was	1
this	1
girl	1
was	1
the	1
perfect	1
creature	1
she	1
fancied	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
eagerly	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
The	1
two	1
girls	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
met	1
Kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
said	1
Who	1
are	1
you	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
Are	1
you	1
really	1
the	1
exquisite	1
creature	1
I	1
imagine	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
But	1
for	1
goodness	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
suppose	1
her	1
eyes	1
added	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
force	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
on	1
you	1
I	1
simply	1
admire	1
you	1
and	1
like	1
you	1
I	1
like	1
you	1
too	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
very	1
very	1
sweet	1
And	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
you	1
better	1
still	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
time	1
answered	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
girl	1
Kitty	1
saw	1
indeed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
busy	1
Either	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
Russian	1
family	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
springs	1
or	1
fetching	1
a	1
shawl	1
for	1
a	1
sick	1
lady	1
and	1
wrapping	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
or	1
trying	1
to	1
interest	1
an	1
irritable	1
invalid	1
or	1
selecting	1
and	1
buying	1
cakes	1
for	1
tea	1
for	1
someone	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
there	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
crowd	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
attracted	1
universal	1
and	1
unfavorable	1
attention	1
These	1
were	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
stooping	1
figure	1
and	1
huge	1
hands	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
coat	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
black	1
simple	1
and	1
yet	1
terrible	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
pockmarked	1
kind	1
looking	1
woman	1
very	1
badly	1
and	1
tastelessly	1
dressed	1
Recognizing	1
these	1
persons	1
as	1
Russians	1
Kitty	1
had	1
already	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
begun	1
constructing	1
a	1
delightful	1
and	1
touching	1
romance	1
about	1
them	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
having	1
ascertained	1
from	1
the	1
visitors	1
list	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
and	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
explained	1
to	1
Kitty	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
man	1
this	1
Levin	1
was	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
fancies	1
about	1
these	1
two	1
people	1
vanished	1
Not	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
what	1
her	1
mother	1
told	1
her	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Konstantin	1
s	1
brother	1
this	1
pair	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
Kitty	1
intensely	1
unpleasant	1
This	1
Levin	1
with	1
his	1
continual	1
twitching	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
now	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
feeling	1
of	1
disgust	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
his	1
big	1
terrible	1
eyes	1
which	1
persistently	1
pursued	1
her	1
expressed	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
hatred	1
and	1
contempt	1
and	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
him	1
Chapter	1
31	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wet	1
day	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
raining	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
invalids	1
with	1
their	1
parasols	1
had	1
flocked	1
into	1
the	1
arcades	1
Kitty	1
was	1
walking	1
there	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
Moscow	1
colonel	1
smart	1
and	1
jaunty	1
in	1
his	1
European	1
coat	1
bought	1
ready	1
made	1
at	1
Frankfort	1
They	1
were	1
walking	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
arcade	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
Levin	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Varenka	1
in	1
her	1
dark	1
dress	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
hat	1
with	1
a	1
turn	1
down	1
brim	1
was	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
arcade	1
with	1
a	1
blind	1
Frenchwoman	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
met	1
Kitty	1
they	1
exchanged	1
friendly	1
glances	1
Mamma	1
couldn	1
t	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
said	1
Kitty	1
watching	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
there	1
together	1
Oh	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
so	1
much	1
I	1
ll	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
her	1
first	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
myself	1
answered	1
her	1
mother	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
in	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
A	1
companion	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
If	1
you	1
like	1
I	1
ll	1
make	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
belle	1
soeur	1
added	1
the	1
princess	1
lifting	1
her	1
head	1
haughtily	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
offended	1
that	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
avoid	1
making	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
insist	1
How	1
wonderfully	1
sweet	1
she	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
gazing	1
at	1
Varenka	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
handed	1
a	1
glass	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
Look	1
how	1
natural	1
and	1
sweet	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
funny	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
engouements	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
No	1
we	1
d	1
better	1
go	1
back	1
she	1
added	1
noticing	1
Levin	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
a	1
German	1
doctor	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
very	1
noisily	1
and	1
angrily	1
They	1
turned	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
when	1
suddenly	1
they	1
heard	1
not	1
noisy	1
talk	1
but	1
shouting	1
Levin	1
stopping	1
short	1
was	1
shouting	1
at	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
too	1
was	1
excited	1
A	1
crowd	1
gathered	1
about	1
them	1
The	1
princess	1
and	1
Kitty	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat	1
while	1
the	1
colonel	1
joined	1
the	1
crowd	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
colonel	1
overtook	1
them	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
inquired	1
the	1
princess	1
Scandalous	1
and	1
disgraceful	1
answered	1
the	1
colonel	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
is	1
meeting	1
Russians	1
abroad	1
That	1
tall	1
gentleman	1
was	1
abusing	1
the	1
doctor	1
flinging	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
insults	1
at	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
wasn	1
t	1
treating	1
him	1
quite	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
waving	1
his	1
stick	1
at	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
simply	1
a	1
scandal	1
Oh	1
how	1
unpleasant	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Well	1
and	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
end	1
Luckily	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
mushroom	1
hat	1
intervened	1
A	1
Russian	1
lady	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
Yes	1
yes	1
She	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
before	1
anyone	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
There	1
mamma	1
said	1
Kitty	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
enthusiastic	1
about	1
her	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
Kitty	1
noticed	1
that	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
terms	1
with	1
Levin	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
as	1
with	1
her	1
other	1
prot'eg'es	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
served	1
as	1
interpreter	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
any	1
foreign	1
language	1
Kitty	1
began	1
to	1
entreat	1
her	1
mother	1
still	1
more	1
urgently	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
make	1
friends	1
with	1
Varenka	1
And	1
disagreeable	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
seem	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
in	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
who	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
give	1
herself	1
airs	1
she	1
made	1
inquiries	1
about	1
Varenka	1
and	1
having	1
ascertained	1
particulars	1
about	1
her	1
tending	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
harm	1
though	1
little	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
herself	1
approached	1
Varenka	1
and	1
made	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
her	1
Choosing	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
spring	1
while	1
Varenka	1
had	1
stopped	1
outside	1
the	1
baker	1
s	1
the	1
princess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
dignified	1
smile	1
My	1
daughter	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
Possibly	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
That	1
feeling	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
reciprocal	1
princess	1
Varenka	1
answered	1
hurriedly	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
deed	1
you	1
did	1
yesterday	1
to	1
our	1
poor	1
compatriot	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Varenka	1
flushed	1
a	1
little	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
I	1
did	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
Why	1
you	1
saved	1
that	1
Levin	1
from	1
disagreeable	1
consequences	1
Yes	1
sa	1
compagne	1
called	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
pacify	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
I	1
m	1
used	1
to	1
looking	1
after	1
such	1
invalids	1
Yes	1
I	1
ve	1
heard	1
you	1
live	1
at	1
Mentone	1
with	1
your	1
aunt	1
I	1
think	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
belle	1
soeur	1
No	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
aunt	1
I	1
call	1
her	1
mamma	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
related	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
by	1
her	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
again	1
This	1
was	1
so	1
simply	1
said	1
and	1
so	1
sweet	1
was	1
the	1
truthful	1
and	1
candid	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
saw	1
why	1
Kitty	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
Varenka	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
this	1
Levin	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
He	1
s	1
going	1
away	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
Kitty	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
spring	1
beaming	1
with	1
delight	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
her	1
unknown	1
friend	1
Well	1
see	1
Kitty	1
your	1
intense	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
friends	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
Varenka	1
put	1
in	1
smiling	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
everyone	1
calls	1
me	1
Kitty	1
blushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
slowly	1
without	1
speaking	1
pressed	1
her	1
new	1
friend	1
s	1
hand	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
her	1
pressure	1
but	1
lay	1
motionless	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
The	1
hand	1
did	1
not	1
respond	1
to	1
her	1
pressure	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
glowed	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
glad	1
though	1
rather	1
mournful	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
large	1
but	1
handsome	1
teeth	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
wished	1
for	1
this	1
too	1
she	1
said	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
busy	1
Oh	1
no	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
busy	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
new	1
friends	1
because	1
two	1
little	1
Russian	1
girls	1
children	1
of	1
an	1
invalid	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
Varenka	1
mamma	1
s	1
calling	1
they	1
cried	1
And	1
Varenka	1
went	1
after	1
them	1
Chapter	1
32	1
The	1
particulars	1
which	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
learned	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
Varenka	1
s	1
past	1
and	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
were	1
as	1
follows	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
of	1
whom	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
worried	1
her	1
husband	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
while	1
others	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
wretched	1
by	1
his	1
immoral	1
behavior	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
weak	1
health	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
temperament	1
When	1
after	1
her	1
separation	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
her	1
only	1
child	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
died	1
almost	1
immediately	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
knowing	1
her	1
sensibility	1
and	1
fearing	1
the	1
news	1
would	1
kill	1
her	1
had	1
substituted	1
another	1
child	1
a	1
baby	1
born	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
cook	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Household	1
This	1
was	1
Varenka	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
learned	1
later	1
on	1
that	1
Varenka	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
own	1
child	1
but	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
bringing	1
her	1
up	1
especially	1
as	1
very	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
Varenka	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
living	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
living	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
years	1
continuously	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
never	1
leaving	1
her	1
couch	1
And	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
that	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
social	1
position	1
as	1
a	1
philanthropic	1
highly	1
religious	1
woman	1
other	1
people	1
said	1
she	1
really	1
was	1
at	1
heart	1
the	1
highly	1
ethical	1
being	1
living	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
her	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
which	1
she	1
represented	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
No	1
one	1
knew	1
what	1
her	1
faith	1
was	1
Catholic	1
Protestant	1
or	1
Orthodox	1
But	1
one	1
fact	1
was	1
indubitable	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
amicable	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
dignitaries	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
and	1
sects	1
Varenka	1
lived	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
abroad	1
and	1
everyone	1
who	1
knew	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
knew	1
and	1
liked	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
as	1
everyone	1
called	1
her	1
Having	1
learned	1
all	1
these	1
facts	1
the	1
princess	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
object	1
to	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Varenka	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
Varenka	1
s	1
breeding	1
and	1
education	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
she	1
spoke	1
French	1
and	1
English	1
extremely	1
well	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
weight	1
brought	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
expressing	1
her	1
regret	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
her	1
ill	1
health	1
from	1
making	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
After	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
Varenka	1
Kitty	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
fascinated	1
by	1
her	1
friend	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
she	1
discovered	1
new	1
virtues	1
in	1
her	1
The	1
princess	1
hearing	1
that	1
Varenka	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
voice	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
sing	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Kitty	1
plays	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
piano	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
so	1
much	1
pleasure	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
her	1
affected	1
smile	1
which	1
Kitty	1
disliked	1
particularly	1
just	1
then	1
because	1
she	1
noticed	1
that	1
Varenka	1
had	1
no	1
inclination	1
to	1
sing	1
Varenka	1
came	1
however	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
music	1
with	1
her	1
The	1
princess	1
had	1
invited	1
Marya	1
Yevgenyevna	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
Varenka	1
seemed	1
quite	1
unaffected	1
by	1
there	1
being	1
persons	1
present	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
piano	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
accompany	1
herself	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
sing	1
music	1
at	1
sight	1
very	1
well	1
Kitty	1
who	1
played	1
well	1
accompanied	1
her	1
You	1
have	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
talent	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
Varenka	1
had	1
sung	1
the	1
first	1
song	1
extremely	1
well	1
Marya	1
Yevgenyevna	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
expressed	1
their	1
thanks	1
and	1
admiration	1
Look	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
what	1
an	1
audience	1
has	1
collected	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
you	1
There	1
actually	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
considerable	1
crowd	1
under	1
the	1
windows	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
it	1
gives	1
you	1
pleasure	1
Varenka	1
answered	1
simply	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
with	1
pride	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
She	1
was	1
enchanted	1
by	1
her	1
talent	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
by	1
her	1
manner	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
Varenka	1
obviously	1
thought	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
singing	1
and	1
was	1
quite	1
unmoved	1
by	1
their	1
praises	1
She	1
seemed	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
asking	1
Am	1
I	1
to	1
sing	1
again	1
or	1
is	1
that	1
enough	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
I	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
how	1
proud	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
How	1
delighted	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
crowd	1
under	1
the	1
windows	1
But	1
she	1
s	1
utterly	1
unmoved	1
by	1
it	1
Her	1
only	1
motive	1
is	1
to	1
avoid	1
refusing	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
mamma	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
her	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
gives	1
her	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
independently	1
of	1
everything	1
How	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
it	1
of	1
her	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
gazing	1
into	1
her	1
serene	1
face	1
The	1
princess	1
asked	1
Varenka	1
to	1
sing	1
again	1
and	1
Varenka	1
sang	1
another	1
song	1
also	1
smoothly	1
distinctly	1
and	1
well	1
standing	1
erect	1
at	1
the	1
piano	1
and	1
beating	1
time	1
on	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
dark	1
skinned	1
hand	1
The	1
next	1
song	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
an	1
Italian	1
one	1
Kitty	1
played	1
the	1
opening	1
bars	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Varenka	1
Let	1
s	1
skip	1
that	1
said	1
Varenka	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
Kitty	1
let	1
her	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
Varenka	1
s	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dismay	1
and	1
inquiry	1
Very	1
well	1
the	1
next	1
one	1
she	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
feeling	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
song	1
No	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
music	1
no	1
let	1
s	1
have	1
that	1
one	1
And	1
she	1
sang	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
coolly	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
they	1
all	1
thanked	1
her	1
again	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
tea	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Varenka	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
that	1
adjoined	1
the	1
house	1
Am	1
I	1
right	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
reminiscences	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
song	1
said	1
Kitty	1
Don	1
t	1
tell	1
me	1
she	1
added	1
hastily	1
only	1
say	1
if	1
I	1
m	1
right	1
No	1
why	1
not	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
simply	1
said	1
Varenka	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
Yes	1
it	1
brings	1
up	1
memories	1
once	1
painful	1
ones	1
I	1
cared	1
for	1
someone	1
once	1
and	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
sing	1
him	1
that	1
song	1
Kitty	1
with	1
big	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
silently	1
sympathetically	1
at	1
Varenka	1
I	1
cared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
his	1
mother	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
married	1
another	1
girl	1
He	1
s	1
living	1
now	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
us	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
sometimes	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
think	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
love	1
story	1
too	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
faint	1
gleam	1
in	1
her	1
handsome	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
fire	1
which	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
must	1
once	1
have	1
glowed	1
all	1
over	1
her	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
think	1
so	1
Why	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
care	1
for	1
anyone	1
else	1
after	1
knowing	1
you	1
Only	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
please	1
his	1
mother	1
forget	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
unhappy	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
heart	1
Oh	1
no	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
man	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
unhappy	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
happy	1
Well	1
so	1
we	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
singing	1
any	1
more	1
now	1
she	1
added	1
turning	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
How	1
good	1
you	1
are	1
how	1
good	1
you	1
are	1
cried	1
Kitty	1
and	1
stopping	1
her	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
even	1
a	1
little	1
like	1
you	1
Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
like	1
anyone	1
You	1
re	1
nice	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
said	1
Varenka	1
smiling	1
her	1
gentle	1
weary	1
smile	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
nice	1
at	1
all	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
Stop	1
a	1
minute	1
let	1
s	1
sit	1
down	1
said	1
Kitty	1
making	1
her	1
sit	1
down	1
again	1
beside	1
her	1
Tell	1
me	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
humiliating	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
disdained	1
your	1
love	1
that	1
he	1
hasn	1
t	1
cared	1
for	1
it	1
But	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
disdain	1
it	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dutiful	1
son	1
Yes	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
own	1
doing	1
said	1
Kitty	1
feeling	1
she	1
was	1
giving	1
away	1
her	1
secret	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
burning	1
with	1
the	1
flush	1
of	1
shame	1
had	1
betrayed	1
her	1
already	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
wrong	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
regretted	1
him	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
evidently	1
realizing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
talking	1
not	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
of	1
Kitty	1
But	1
the	1
humiliation	1
said	1
Kitty	1
the	1
humiliation	1
one	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
she	1
said	1
remembering	1
her	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
ball	1
during	1
the	1
pause	1
in	1
the	1
music	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
humiliation	1
Why	1
you	1
did	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
Worse	1
than	1
wrong	1
shameful	1
Varenka	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
Kitty	1
s	1
hand	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
shameful	1
she	1
said	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
tell	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
loved	1
him	1
did	1
you	1
Of	1
course	1
not	1
I	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
No	1
no	1
there	1
are	1
looks	1
there	1
are	1
ways	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
forget	1
it	1
if	1
I	1
live	1
a	1
hundred	1
years	1
Why	1
so	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
The	1
whole	1
point	1
is	1
whether	1
you	1
love	1
him	1
now	1
or	1
not	1
said	1
Varenka	1
who	1
called	1
everything	1
by	1
its	1
name	1
I	1
hate	1
him	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
myself	1
Why	1
what	1
for	1
The	1
shame	1
the	1
humiliation	1
Oh	1
if	1
everyone	1
were	1
as	1
sensitive	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
said	1
Varenka	1
There	1
isn	1
t	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
hasn	1
t	1
been	1
through	1
the	1
same	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
so	1
unimportant	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
important	1
said	1
Kitty	1
looking	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
inquisitive	1
wonder	1
Oh	1
there	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
s	1
important	1
said	1
Varenka	1
smiling	1
Why	1
what	1
Oh	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
s	1
more	1
important	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
Kitty	1
it	1
s	1
cold	1
Either	1
get	1
a	1
shawl	1
or	1
come	1
indoors	1
It	1
really	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
said	1
Varenka	1
getting	1
up	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
Madame	1
Berthe	1
s	1
she	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
Kitty	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
passionate	1
curiosity	1
and	1
entreaty	1
her	1
eyes	1
asked	1
her	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
that	1
gives	1
you	1
such	1
tranquillity	1
You	1
know	1
tell	1
me	1
But	1
Varenka	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
Kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
asking	1
her	1
She	1
merely	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
Madame	1
Berthe	1
too	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
haste	1
home	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
maman	1
s	1
tea	1
at	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
She	1
went	1
indoors	1
collected	1
her	1
music	1
and	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
everyone	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
home	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
Yes	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
go	1
alone	1
at	1
night	1
like	1
this	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
Anyway	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
Parasha	1
Kitty	1
saw	1
that	1
Varenka	1
could	1
hardly	1
restrain	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
needed	1
an	1
escort	1
No	1
I	1
always	1
go	1
about	1
alone	1
and	1
nothing	1
ever	1
happens	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
taking	1
her	1
hat	1
And	1
kissing	1
Kitty	1
once	1
more	1
without	1
saying	1
what	1
was	1
important	1
she	1
stepped	1
out	1
courageously	1
with	1
the	1
music	1
under	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
night	1
bearing	1
away	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
secret	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
important	1
and	1
what	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
dignity	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
envied	1
Chapter	1
33	1
Kitty	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
too	1
and	1
this	1
acquaintance	1
together	1
with	1
her	1
friendship	1
with	1
Varenka	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
exercise	1
a	1
great	1
influence	1
on	1
her	1
it	1
also	1
comforted	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
mental	1
distress	1
She	1
found	1
this	1
comfort	1
through	1
a	1
completely	1
new	1
world	1
being	1
opened	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
this	1
acquaintance	1
a	1
world	1
having	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
her	1
past	1
an	1
exalted	1
noble	1
world	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
contemplate	1
her	1
past	1
calmly	1
It	1
was	1
revealed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
besides	1
the	1
instinctive	1
life	1
to	1
which	1
Kitty	1
had	1
given	1
herself	1
up	1
hitherto	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
spiritual	1
life	1
This	1
life	1
was	1
disclosed	1
in	1
religion	1
but	1
a	1
religion	1
having	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
that	1
one	1
which	1
Kitty	1
had	1
known	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
which	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
litanies	1
and	1
all	1
night	1
services	1
at	1
the	1
Widow	1
s	1
Home	1
where	1
one	1
might	1
meet	1
one	1
s	1
friends	1
and	1
in	1
learning	1
by	1
heart	1
Slavonic	1
texts	1
with	1
the	1
priest	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
lofty	1
mysterious	1
religion	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
noble	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
merely	1
believe	1
because	1
one	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
love	1
Kitty	1
found	1
all	1
this	1
out	1
not	1
from	1
words	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
talked	1
to	1
Kitty	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
charming	1
child	1
that	1
one	1
looks	1
on	1
with	1
pleasure	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
youth	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
passing	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
human	1
sorrows	1
nothing	1
gives	1
comfort	1
but	1
love	1
and	1
faith	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Christ	1
s	1
compassion	1
for	1
us	1
no	1
sorrow	1
is	1
trifling	1
and	1
immediately	1
talked	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
But	1
in	1
every	1
gesture	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
in	1
every	1
word	1
in	1
every	1
heavenly	1
as	1
Kitty	1
called	1
it	1
look	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
which	1
she	1
heard	1
from	1
Varenka	1
Kitty	1
recognized	1
that	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
important	1
of	1
which	1
till	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
nothing	1
Yet	1
elevated	1
as	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
s	1
character	1
was	1
touching	1
as	1
was	1
her	1
story	1
and	1
exalted	1
and	1
moving	1
as	1
was	1
her	1
speech	1
Kitty	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
detecting	1
in	1
her	1
some	1
traits	1
which	1
perplexed	1
her	1
She	1
noticed	1
that	1
when	1
questioning	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
family	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
Christian	1
meekness	1
She	1
noticed	1
too	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
Catholic	1
priest	1
with	1
her	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
studiously	1
kept	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
shade	1
and	1
had	1
smiled	1
in	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way	1
Trivial	1
as	1
these	1
two	1
observations	1
were	1
they	1
perplexed	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
doubts	1
as	1
to	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
Varenka	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
without	1
friends	1
or	1
relations	1
with	1
a	1
melancholy	1
disappointment	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
desiring	1
nothing	1
regretting	1
nothing	1
was	1
just	1
that	1
perfection	1
of	1
which	1
Kitty	1
dared	1
hardly	1
dream	1
In	1
Varenka	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
but	1
to	1
forget	1
oneself	1
and	1
love	1
others	1
and	1
one	1
will	1
be	1
calm	1
happy	1
and	1
noble	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
Kitty	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
Seeing	1
now	1
clearly	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
Kitty	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
being	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
it	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
herself	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
that	1
was	1
opening	1
to	1
her	1
From	1
Varenka	1
s	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
whom	1
she	1
mentioned	1
Kitty	1
had	1
already	1
constructed	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
future	1
life	1
She	1
would	1
like	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
s	1
niece	1
Aline	1
of	1
whom	1
Varenka	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
seek	1
out	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
trouble	1
wherever	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
living	1
help	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
Gospel	1
read	1
the	1
Gospel	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
to	1
criminals	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
reading	1
the	1
Gospel	1
to	1
criminals	1
as	1
Aline	1
did	1
particularly	1
fascinated	1
Kitty	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
secret	1
dreams	1
of	1
which	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
either	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
or	1
to	1
Varenka	1
While	1
awaiting	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
carrying	1
out	1
her	1
plans	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
however	1
Kitty	1
even	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
springs	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
ill	1
and	1
unhappy	1
readily	1
found	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
practicing	1
her	1
new	1
principles	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
Varenka	1
At	1
first	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
much	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
engouement	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
it	1
for	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
for	1
Varenka	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
imitate	1
Varenka	1
in	1
her	1
conduct	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
imitated	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
blinking	1
her	1
eyes	1
But	1
later	1
on	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
this	1
adoration	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
serious	1
spiritual	1
change	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
The	1
princess	1
saw	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
Kitty	1
read	1
a	1
French	1
testament	1
that	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
done	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
avoided	1
society	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
sick	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
under	1
Varenka	1
s	1
protection	1
and	1
especially	1
one	1
poor	1
family	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
sick	1
painter	1
Petrov	1
Kitty	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
proud	1
of	1
playing	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
mercy	1
in	1
that	1
family	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
well	1
enough	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
it	1
especially	1
as	1
Petrov	1
s	1
wife	1
was	1
a	1
perfectly	1
nice	1
sort	1
of	1
woman	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
German	1
princess	1
noticing	1
Kitty	1
s	1
devotion	1
praised	1
her	1
calling	1
her	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
consolation	1
All	1
this	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
well	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
exaggeration	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
rushing	1
into	1
extremes	1
and	1
so	1
indeed	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
Il	1
ne	1
faut	1
jamais	1
rien	1
outrer	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Her	1
daughter	1
made	1
her	1
no	1
reply	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
exaggeration	1
where	1
Christianity	1
was	1
concerned	1
What	1
exaggeration	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
a	1
doctrine	1
wherein	1
one	1
was	1
bidden	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
other	1
cheek	1
when	1
one	1
was	1
smitten	1
and	1
give	1
one	1
s	1
cloak	1
if	1
one	1
s	1
coat	1
were	1
taken	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
disliked	1
this	1
exaggeration	1
and	1
disliked	1
even	1
more	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
her	1
daughter	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
Kitty	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
conceal	1
her	1
new	1
views	1
and	1
feelings	1
from	1
her	1
mother	1
She	1
concealed	1
them	1
not	1
because	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
respect	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
mother	1
but	1
simply	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
her	1
mother	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
revealed	1
them	1
to	1
anyone	1
sooner	1
than	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
s	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
one	1
day	1
of	1
Madame	1
Petrova	1
I	1
ve	1
asked	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
seems	1
put	1
out	1
about	1
something	1
No	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
noticed	1
it	1
maman	1
said	1
Kitty	1
flushing	1
hotly	1
Is	1
it	1
long	1
since	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
We	1
re	1
meaning	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
expedition	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
tomorrow	1
answered	1
Kitty	1
Well	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
embarrassed	1
face	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
embarrassment	1
That	1
day	1
Varenka	1
came	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
expedition	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
And	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
again	1
that	1
Kitty	1
reddened	1
Kitty	1
haven	1
t	1
you	1
had	1
some	1
misunderstanding	1
with	1
the	1
Petrovs	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
Why	1
has	1
she	1
given	1
up	1
sending	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
Kitty	1
answered	1
that	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
why	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
seemed	1
displeased	1
with	1
her	1
Kitty	1
answered	1
perfectly	1
truly	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
reason	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
changed	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
guessed	1
it	1
She	1
guessed	1
at	1
something	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
mother	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
into	1
words	1
to	1
herself	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
one	1
knows	1
but	1
which	1
one	1
can	1
never	1
speak	1
of	1
even	1
to	1
oneself	1
so	1
terrible	1
and	1
shameful	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
Again	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
went	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
memory	1
all	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
She	1
remembered	1
the	1
simple	1
delight	1
expressed	1
on	1
the	1
round	1
good	1
humored	1
face	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
at	1
their	1
meetings	1
she	1
remembered	1
their	1
secret	1
confabulations	1
about	1
the	1
invalid	1
their	1
plots	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
forbidden	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
the	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
youngest	1
boy	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
my	1
Kitty	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
without	1
her	1
How	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
Then	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
thin	1
terribly	1
thin	1
figure	1
of	1
Petrov	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
neck	1
in	1
his	1
brown	1
coat	1
his	1
scant	1
curly	1
hair	1
his	1
questioning	1
blue	1
eyes	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
Kitty	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
his	1
painful	1
attempts	1
to	1
seem	1
hearty	1
and	1
lively	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
She	1
recalled	1
the	1
efforts	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
repugnance	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
for	1
all	1
consumptive	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
pains	1
it	1
had	1
cost	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
She	1
recalled	1
the	1
timid	1
softened	1
look	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
compassion	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
later	1
of	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
goodness	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
at	1
it	1
How	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
Now	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
everything	1
was	1
suddenly	1
spoiled	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
met	1
Kitty	1
with	1
affected	1
cordiality	1
and	1
had	1
kept	1
continual	1
watch	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
Could	1
that	1
touching	1
pleasure	1
he	1
showed	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
near	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
s	1
coolness	1
Yes	1
she	1
mused	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unnatural	1
about	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
her	1
good	1
nature	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
There	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
waiting	1
for	1
you	1
he	1
wouldn	1
t	1
drink	1
his	1
coffee	1
without	1
you	1
though	1
he	1
s	1
grown	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
weak	1
Yes	1
perhaps	1
too	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
rug	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
simple	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
so	1
awkwardly	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
long	1
thanking	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
awkward	1
too	1
And	1
then	1
that	1
portrait	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
well	1
And	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
look	1
of	1
confusion	1
and	1
tenderness	1
Yes	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
Kitty	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
horror	1
No	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
it	1
oughtn	1
t	1
to	1
be	1
He	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
directly	1
after	1
This	1
doubt	1
poisoned	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
new	1
life	1
Chapter	1
34	1
Before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
drinking	1
the	1
waters	1
Prince	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
from	1
Carlsbad	1
to	1
Baden	1
and	1
Kissingen	1
to	1
Russian	1
friends	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
Russian	1
air	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
daughter	1
The	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
on	1
life	1
abroad	1
were	1
completely	1
opposed	1
The	1
princess	1
thought	1
everything	1
delightful	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
established	1
position	1
in	1
Russian	1
society	1
she	1
tried	1
abroad	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
European	1
fashionable	1
lady	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
simple	1
reason	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
typical	1
Russian	1
gentlewoman	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
affected	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
altogether	1
suit	1
her	1
The	1
prince	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
thought	1
everything	1
foreign	1
detestable	1
got	1
sick	1
of	1
European	1
life	1
kept	1
to	1
his	1
Russian	1
habits	1
and	1
purposely	1
tried	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
abroad	1
less	1
European	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
The	1
prince	1
returned	1
thinner	1
with	1
the	1
skin	1
hanging	1
in	1
loose	1
bags	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
His	1
good	1
humor	1
was	1
even	1
greater	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Kitty	1
completely	1
recovered	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
friendship	1
with	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
Varenka	1
and	1
the	1
reports	1
the	1
princess	1
gave	1
him	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
change	1
she	1
had	1
noticed	1
in	1
Kitty	1
troubled	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
aroused	1
his	1
habitual	1
feeling	1
of	1
jealousy	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
drew	1
his	1
daughter	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
dread	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
his	1
influence	1
into	1
regions	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
these	1
unpleasant	1
matters	1
were	1
all	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
kindliness	1
and	1
good	1
humor	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
within	1
him	1
and	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
ever	1
since	1
his	1
course	1
of	1
Carlsbad	1
waters	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
his	1
long	1
overcoat	1
with	1
his	1
Russian	1
wrinkles	1
and	1
baggy	1
cheeks	1
propped	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
starched	1
collar	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
the	1
spring	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
good	1
humor	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
morning	1
the	1
bright	1
cheerful	1
houses	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
gardens	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
faced	1
red	1
armed	1
beer	1
drinking	1
German	1
waitresses	1
working	1
away	1
merrily	1
did	1
the	1
heart	1
good	1
But	1
the	1
nearer	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
springs	1
the	1
oftener	1
they	1
met	1
sick	1
people	1
and	1
their	1
appearance	1
seemed	1
more	1
pitiable	1
than	1
ever	1
among	1
the	1
everyday	1
conditions	1
of	1
prosperous	1
German	1
life	1
Kitty	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
struck	1
by	1
this	1
contrast	1
The	1
bright	1
sun	1
the	1
brilliant	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
foliage	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
music	1
were	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
natural	1
setting	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
familiar	1
faces	1
with	1
their	1
changes	1
to	1
greater	1
emaciation	1
or	1
to	1
convalescence	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
watched	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
the	1
brightness	1
and	1
gaiety	1
of	1
the	1
June	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
playing	1
a	1
gay	1
waltz	1
then	1
in	1
fashion	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
healthy	1
attendants	1
seemed	1
something	1
unseemly	1
and	1
monstrous	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
these	1
slowly	1
moving	1
dying	1
figures	1
gathered	1
together	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
Europe	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
youth	1
with	1
his	1
favorite	1
daughter	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
felt	1
awkward	1
and	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
vigorous	1
step	1
and	1
his	1
sturdy	1
stout	1
limbs	1
He	1
felt	1
almost	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
crowd	1
Present	1
me	1
to	1
your	1
new	1
friends	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
I	1
like	1
even	1
your	1
horrid	1
Soden	1
for	1
making	1
you	1
so	1
well	1
again	1
Only	1
it	1
s	1
melancholy	1
very	1
melancholy	1
here	1
Who	1
s	1
that	1
Kitty	1
mentioned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
met	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
acquainted	1
and	1
some	1
not	1
At	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
they	1
met	1
the	1
blind	1
lady	1
Madame	1
Berthe	1
with	1
her	1
guide	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
Frenchwoman	1
s	1
face	1
light	1
up	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
Kitty	1
s	1
voice	1
She	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
French	1
exaggerated	1
politeness	1
applauding	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
delightful	1
daughter	1
extolling	1
Kitty	1
to	1
the	1
skies	1
before	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
calling	1
her	1
a	1
treasure	1
a	1
pearl	1
and	1
a	1
consoling	1
angel	1
Well	1
she	1
s	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
smiling	1
she	1
calls	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
angel	1
number	1
one	1
Oh	1
Mademoiselle	1
Varenka	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
real	1
angel	1
allez	1
Madame	1
Berthe	1
assented	1
In	1
the	1
arcade	1
they	1
met	1
Varenka	1
herself	1
She	1
was	1
walking	1
rapidly	1
towards	1
them	1
carrying	1
an	1
elegant	1
red	1
bag	1
Here	1
is	1
papa	1
come	1
Kitty	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Varenka	1
made	1
simply	1
and	1
naturally	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
everything	1
a	1
movement	1
between	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
a	1
curtsey	1
and	1
immediately	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
without	1
shyness	1
naturally	1
as	1
she	1
talked	1
to	1
everyone	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
in	1
which	1
Kitty	1
detected	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
liked	1
her	1
friend	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
in	1
such	1
haste	1
Maman	1
s	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
Kitty	1
She	1
has	1
not	1
slept	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
I	1
m	1
taking	1
her	1
her	1
work	1
So	1
that	1
s	1
angel	1
number	1
one	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
when	1
Varenka	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
Kitty	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
Varenka	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
because	1
he	1
liked	1
her	1
Come	1
so	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
your	1
friends	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
even	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
if	1
she	1
deigns	1
to	1
recognize	1
me	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
papa	1
Kitty	1
asked	1
apprehensively	1
catching	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
that	1
kindled	1
in	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
too	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
she	1
d	1
joined	1
the	1
Pietists	1
What	1
is	1
a	1
Pietist	1
papa	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
dismayed	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
prized	1
so	1
highly	1
in	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
quite	1
know	1
myself	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
thanks	1
God	1
for	1
everything	1
for	1
every	1
misfortune	1
and	1
thanks	1
God	1
too	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
died	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
rather	1
droll	1
as	1
they	1
didn	1
t	1
get	1
on	1
together	1
Who	1
s	1
that	1
What	1
a	1
piteous	1
face	1
he	1
asked	1
noticing	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
wearing	1
a	1
brown	1
overcoat	1
and	1
white	1
trousers	1
that	1
fell	1
in	1
strange	1
folds	1
about	1
his	1
long	1
fleshless	1
legs	1
This	1
man	1
lifted	1
his	1
straw	1
hat	1
showed	1
his	1
scanty	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
high	1
forehead	1
painfully	1
reddened	1
by	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
hat	1
That	1
s	1
Petrov	1
an	1
artist	1
answered	1
Kitty	1
blushing	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
added	1
indicating	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
who	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
purpose	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
they	1
approached	1
walked	1
away	1
after	1
a	1
child	1
that	1
had	1
run	1
off	1
along	1
a	1
path	1
Poor	1
fellow	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
nice	1
face	1
he	1
has	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
Why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
Well	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
then	1
said	1
Kitty	1
turning	1
round	1
resolutely	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
feeling	1
today	1
she	1
asked	1
Petrov	1
Petrov	1
got	1
up	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
stick	1
and	1
looked	1
shyly	1
at	1
the	1
prince	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
daughter	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
myself	1
The	1
painter	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
showing	1
his	1
strangely	1
dazzling	1
white	1
teeth	1
We	1
expected	1
you	1
yesterday	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Kitty	1
He	1
staggered	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
then	1
repeated	1
the	1
motion	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
intentional	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
but	1
Varenka	1
said	1
that	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
sent	1
word	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
going	1
Not	1
going	1
said	1
Petrov	1
blushing	1
and	1
immediately	1
beginning	1
to	1
cough	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
his	1
wife	1
Anita	1
Anita	1
he	1
said	1
loudly	1
and	1
the	1
swollen	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords	1
on	1
his	1
thin	1
white	1
neck	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
came	1
up	1
So	1
you	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
we	1
weren	1
t	1
going	1
he	1
whispered	1
to	1
her	1
angrily	1
losing	1
his	1
voice	1
Good	1
morning	1
princess	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
an	1
assumed	1
smile	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
her	1
former	1
manner	1
Very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
You	1
ve	1
long	1
been	1
expected	1
prince	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
send	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
we	1
weren	1
t	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
artist	1
whispered	1
hoarsely	1
once	1
more	1
still	1
more	1
angrily	1
obviously	1
exasperated	1
that	1
his	1
voice	1
failed	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
words	1
the	1
expression	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
Oh	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
I	1
thought	1
we	1
weren	1
t	1
going	1
his	1
wife	1
answered	1
crossly	1
What	1
when	1
He	1
coughed	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
The	1
prince	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
Ah	1
ah	1
he	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
Oh	1
poor	1
things	1
Yes	1
papa	1
answered	1
Kitty	1
And	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
they	1
ve	1
three	1
children	1
no	1
servant	1
and	1
scarcely	1
any	1
means	1
He	1
gets	1
something	1
from	1
the	1
Academy	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
briskly	1
trying	1
to	1
drown	1
the	1
distress	1
that	1
the	1
queer	1
change	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
s	1
manner	1
to	1
her	1
had	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
Oh	1
here	1
s	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
said	1
Kitty	1
indicating	1
an	1
invalid	1
carriage	1
where	1
propped	1
on	1
pillows	1
something	1
in	1
gray	1
and	1
blue	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
a	1
sunshade	1
This	1
was	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
Behind	1
her	1
stood	1
the	1
gloomy	1
healthy	1
looking	1
German	1
workman	1
who	1
pushed	1
the	1
carriage	1
Close	1
by	1
was	1
standing	1
a	1
flaxen	1
headed	1
Swedish	1
count	1
whom	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
by	1
name	1
Several	1
invalids	1
were	1
lingering	1
near	1
the	1
low	1
carriage	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
lady	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
some	1
curiosity	1
The	1
prince	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
Kitty	1
detected	1
that	1
disconcerting	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
with	1
extreme	1
courtesy	1
and	1
affability	1
in	1
that	1
excellent	1
French	1
that	1
so	1
few	1
speak	1
nowadays	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
recall	1
myself	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
kindness	1
to	1
my	1
daughter	1
he	1
said	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
not	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
again	1
Prince	1
Alexander	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
said	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
lifting	1
upon	1
him	1
her	1
heavenly	1
eyes	1
in	1
which	1
Kitty	1
discerned	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
annoyance	1
Delighted	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
a	1
great	1
fancy	1
to	1
your	1
daughter	1
You	1
are	1
still	1
in	1
weak	1
health	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
said	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
and	1
she	1
introduced	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
the	1
Swedish	1
count	1
You	1
are	1
scarcely	1
changed	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
It	1
s	1
ten	1
or	1
eleven	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
Yes	1
God	1
sends	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
sends	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
Often	1
one	1
wonders	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
The	1
other	1
side	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
to	1
Varenka	1
who	1
had	1
rearranged	1
the	1
rug	1
over	1
her	1
feet	1
not	1
to	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
To	1
do	1
good	1
probably	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
twinkle	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
said	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
perceiving	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
face	1
So	1
you	1
will	1
send	1
me	1
that	1
book	1
dear	1
count	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
Swede	1
Ah	1
cried	1
the	1
prince	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
colonel	1
standing	1
near	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
Moscow	1
colonel	1
who	1
joined	1
them	1
That	1
s	1
our	1
aristocracy	1
prince	1
the	1
Moscow	1
colonel	1
said	1
with	1
ironical	1
intention	1
He	1
cherished	1
a	1
grudge	1
against	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
for	1
not	1
making	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
She	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
Did	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
before	1
her	1
illness	1
prince	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
before	1
she	1
took	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
Yes	1
She	1
took	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
They	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
ten	1
years	1
since	1
she	1
has	1
stood	1
on	1
her	1
feet	1
She	1
doesn	1
t	1
stand	1
up	1
because	1
her	1
legs	1
are	1
too	1
short	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
figure	1
Papa	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
possible	1
cried	1
Kitty	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
wicked	1
tongues	1
say	1
my	1
darling	1
And	1
your	1
Varenka	1
catches	1
it	1
too	1
he	1
added	1
Oh	1
these	1
invalid	1
ladies	1
Oh	1
no	1
papa	1
Kitty	1
objected	1
warmly	1
Varenka	1
worships	1
her	1
And	1
then	1
she	1
does	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
Ask	1
anyone	1
Everyone	1
knows	1
her	1
and	1
Aline	1
Stahl	1
Perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
when	1
one	1
does	1
good	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
ask	1
everyone	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knows	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
not	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
because	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
reveal	1
her	1
secret	1
thoughts	1
even	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
But	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
although	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
views	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
inmost	1
sanctuary	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
heavenly	1
image	1
of	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
carried	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
had	1
vanished	1
never	1
to	1
return	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
fantastic	1
figure	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
some	1
clothes	1
thrown	1
down	1
at	1
random	1
vanishes	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
some	1
garment	1
lying	1
there	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
short	1
legs	1
who	1
lay	1
down	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
bad	1
figure	1
and	1
worried	1
patient	1
Varenka	1
for	1
not	1
arranging	1
her	1
rug	1
to	1
her	1
liking	1
And	1
by	1
no	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
imagination	1
could	1
Kitty	1
bring	1
back	1
the	1
former	1
Madame	1

Chapter	1
35	1
The	1
prince	1
communicated	1
his	1
good	1
humor	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
German	1
landlord	1
in	1
whose	1
rooms	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
were	1
staying	1
On	1
coming	1
back	1
with	1
Kitty	1
from	1
the	1
springs	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
Marya	1
Yevgenyevna	1
and	1
Varenka	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
have	1
coffee	1
with	1
them	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
chairs	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
under	1
the	1
chestnut	1
tree	1
and	1
lunch	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
there	1
The	1
landlord	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
too	1
grew	1
brisker	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
spirits	1
They	1
knew	1
his	1
open	1
handedness	1
and	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
the	1
invalid	1
doctor	1
from	1
Hamburg	1
who	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
floor	1
looked	1
enviously	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
merry	1
party	1
of	1
healthy	1
Russians	1
assembled	1
under	1
the	1
chestnut	1
tree	1
In	1
the	1
trembling	1
circles	1
of	1
shadow	1
cast	1
by	1
the	1
leaves	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
cloth	1
and	1
set	1
with	1
coffeepot	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
cheese	1
and	1
cold	1
game	1
sat	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
cap	1
with	1
lilac	1
ribbons	1
distributing	1
cups	1
and	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
prince	1
eating	1
heartily	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
merrily	1
The	1
prince	1
had	1
spread	1
out	1
near	1
him	1
his	1
purchases	1
carved	1
boxes	1
and	1
knick	1
knacks	1
paper	1
knives	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
bought	1
a	1
heap	1
at	1
every	1
watering	1
place	1
and	1
bestowed	1
them	1
upon	1
everyone	1
including	1
Lieschen	1
the	1
servant	1
girl	1
and	1
the	1
landlord	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
jested	1
in	1
his	1
comically	1
bad	1
German	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
water	1
had	1
cured	1
Kitty	1
but	1
his	1
splendid	1
cookery	1
especially	1
his	1
plum	1
soup	1
The	1
princess	1
laughed	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
for	1
his	1
Russian	1
ways	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
lively	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
The	1
colonel	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
jokes	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
regards	1
Europe	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
a	1
careful	1
study	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
side	1
The	1
simple	1
hearted	1
Marya	1
Yevgenyevna	1
simply	1
roared	1
with	1
laughter	1
at	1
everything	1
absurd	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
and	1
his	1
jokes	1
made	1
Varenka	1
helpless	1
with	1
feeble	1
but	1
infectious	1
laughter	1
which	1
was	1
something	1
Kitty	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
Kitty	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
light	1
hearted	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
solve	1
the	1
problem	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
set	1
her	1
by	1
his	1
good	1
humored	1
view	1
of	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
attracted	1
her	1
To	1
this	1
doubt	1
there	1
was	1
joined	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
Petrovs	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
conspicuously	1
and	1
unpleasantly	1
marked	1
that	1
morning	1
Everyone	1
was	1
good	1
humored	1
but	1
Kitty	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
good	1
humored	1
and	1
this	1
increased	1
her	1
distress	1
She	1
felt	1
a	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
childhood	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
shut	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
her	1
sisters	1
merry	1
laughter	1
outside	1
Well	1
but	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
buy	1
this	1
mass	1
of	1
things	1
for	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
and	1
handing	1
her	1
husband	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
One	1
goes	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
one	1
looks	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
and	1
they	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
buy	1
Erlaucht	1
Durchlaucht	1
	1
Directly	1
they	1
say	1
Durchlaucht	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
hold	1
out	1
I	1
lose	1
ten	1
thalers	1
It	1
s	1
simply	1
from	1
boredom	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
Such	1
boredom	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
one	1
doesn	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
oneself	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
bored	1
prince	1
There	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
s	1
interesting	1
now	1
in	1
Germany	1
said	1
Marya	1
Yevgenyevna	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
everything	1
that	1
s	1
interesting	1
the	1
plum	1
soup	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
the	1
pea	1
sausages	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
everything	1
No	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
like	1
prince	1
there	1
s	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
their	1
institutions	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
interesting	1
about	1
it	1
They	1
re	1
all	1
as	1
pleased	1
as	1
brass	1
halfpence	1
They	1
ve	1
conquered	1
everybody	1
and	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
at	1
that	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
conquered	1
anyone	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
my	1
own	1
boots	1
yes	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
away	1
too	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
dress	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
to	1
drink	1
bad	1
tea	1
How	1
different	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
home	1
You	1
get	1
up	1
in	1
no	1
haste	1
you	1
get	1
cross	1
grumble	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
come	1
round	1
again	1
You	1
ve	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
things	1
over	1
and	1
no	1
hurry	1
But	1
time	1
s	1
money	1
you	1
forget	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
Time	1
indeed	1
that	1
depends	1
Why	1
there	1
s	1
time	1
one	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
month	1
of	1
for	1
sixpence	1
and	1
time	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
give	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
for	1
any	1
money	1
Isn	1
t	1
that	1
so	1
Katinka	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
depressed	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
depressed	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
Stay	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Varenka	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
going	1
home	1
said	1
Varenka	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
giggle	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
recovered	1
she	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
hat	1
Kitty	1
followed	1
her	1
Even	1
Varenka	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
different	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
worse	1
but	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
her	1
before	1
Oh	1
dear	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
since	1
I	1
ve	1
laughed	1
so	1
much	1
said	1
Varenka	1
gathering	1
up	1
her	1
parasol	1
and	1
her	1
bag	1
How	1
nice	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
father	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
When	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
asked	1
Varenka	1
Mamma	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
Petrovs	1
Won	1
t	1
you	1
be	1
there	1
said	1
Kitty	1
to	1
try	1
Varenka	1
Yes	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
They	1
re	1
getting	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
so	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
pack	1
Well	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
too	1
then	1
No	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
Why	1
not	1
why	1
not	1
why	1
not	1
said	1
Kitty	1
opening	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
and	1
clutching	1
at	1
Varenka	1
s	1
parasol	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
No	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
why	1
not	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
your	1
father	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
besides	1
they	1
will	1
feel	1
awkward	1
at	1
your	1
helping	1
No	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
often	1
at	1
the	1
Petrovs	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
why	1
not	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
said	1
Varenka	1
quietly	1
No	1
please	1
tell	1
me	1
Tell	1
you	1
everything	1
asked	1
Varenka	1
Everything	1
everything	1
Kitty	1
assented	1
Well	1
there	1
s	1
really	1
nothing	1
of	1
any	1
consequence	1
only	1
that	1
Mihail	1
Alexeyevitch	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
artist	1
s	1
name	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
leave	1
earlier	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
said	1
Varenka	1
smiling	1
Well	1
well	1
Kitty	1
urged	1
impatiently	1
looking	1
darkly	1
at	1
Varenka	1
Well	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
Of	1
course	1
that	1
was	1
nonsense	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dispute	1
over	1
it	1
over	1
you	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
irritable	1
these	1
sick	1
people	1
are	1
Kitty	1
scowling	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
kept	1
silent	1
and	1
Varenka	1
went	1
on	1
speaking	1
alone	1
trying	1
to	1
soften	1
or	1
soothe	1
her	1
and	1
seeing	1
a	1
storm	1
coming	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
of	1
tears	1
or	1
of	1
words	1
So	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
go	1
You	1
understand	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
offended	1
And	1
it	1
serves	1
me	1
right	1
And	1
it	1
serves	1
me	1
right	1
Kitty	1
cried	1
quickly	1
snatching	1
the	1
parasol	1
out	1
of	1
Varenka	1
s	1
hand	1
and	1
looking	1
past	1
her	1
friend	1
s	1
face	1
Varenka	1
felt	1
inclined	1
to	1
smile	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
childish	1
fury	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
wounding	1
her	1
How	1
does	1
it	1
serve	1
you	1
right	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
It	1
serves	1
me	1
right	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
sham	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
What	1
business	1
had	1
I	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
outsiders	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
come	1
about	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
quarrel	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
done	1
what	1
nobody	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
Because	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
sham	1
a	1
sham	1
a	1
sham	1
A	1
sham	1
with	1
what	1
object	1
said	1
Varenka	1
gently	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
idiotic	1
so	1
hateful	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
whatever	1
for	1
me	1
Nothing	1
but	1
sham	1
she	1
said	1
opening	1
and	1
shutting	1
the	1
parasol	1
But	1
with	1
what	1
object	1
To	1
seem	1
better	1
to	1
people	1
to	1
myself	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
deceive	1
everyone	1
No	1
now	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
descend	1
to	1
that	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
bad	1
but	1
anyway	1
not	1
a	1
liar	1
a	1
cheat	1
But	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
cheat	1
said	1
Varenka	1
reproachfully	1
You	1
speak	1
as	1
if	1
But	1
Kitty	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
gusts	1
of	1
fury	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
finish	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
you	1
not	1
about	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
You	1
re	1
perfection	1
Yes	1
yes	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
re	1
all	1
perfection	1
but	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
m	1
bad	1
This	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
if	1
I	1
weren	1
t	1
bad	1
So	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
a	1
sham	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Let	1
them	1
go	1
their	1
way	1
and	1
me	1
go	1
mine	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
different	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
that	1
What	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
asked	1
Varenka	1
in	1
bewilderment	1
Everything	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
act	1
except	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
you	1
act	1
from	1
principle	1
I	1
liked	1
you	1
simply	1
but	1
you	1
most	1
likely	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
save	1
me	1
to	1
improve	1
me	1
You	1
are	1
unjust	1
said	1
Varenka	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
I	1
m	1
speaking	1
of	1
myself	1
Kitty	1
they	1
heard	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
voice	1
come	1
here	1
show	1
papa	1
your	1
necklace	1
Kitty	1
with	1
a	1
haughty	1
air	1
without	1
making	1
peace	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
took	1
the	1
necklace	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
box	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
red	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
Nothing	1
she	1
answered	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
back	1
directly	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
back	1
She	1
s	1
still	1
here	1
she	1
thought	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
Oh	1
dear	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
Why	1
was	1
I	1
rude	1
to	1
her	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
and	1
she	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
Varenka	1
in	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
parasol	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
examining	1
the	1
spring	1
which	1
Kitty	1
had	1
broken	1
She	1
lifted	1
her	1
head	1
Varenka	1
forgive	1
me	1
do	1
forgive	1
me	1
whispered	1
Kitty	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
I	1
really	1
didn	1
t	1
mean	1
to	1
hurt	1
you	1
said	1
Varenka	1
smiling	1
Peace	1
was	1
made	1
But	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
coming	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
was	1
transformed	1
for	1
Kitty	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
everything	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
but	1
she	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
deceived	1
herself	1
in	1
supposing	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
it	1
seemed	1
opened	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
maintaining	1
herself	1
without	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
self	1
conceit	1
on	1
the	1
pinnacle	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
wished	1
to	1
mount	1
Moreover	1
she	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
dreariness	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
sorrow	1
of	1
sick	1
and	1
dying	1
people	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
The	1
efforts	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
to	1
like	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
intolerable	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
to	1
Russia	1
to	1
Ergushovo	1
where	1
as	1
she	1
knew	1
from	1
letters	1
her	1
sister	1
Dolly	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
But	1
her	1
affection	1

Chapter	1
1	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Koznishev	1
wanted	1
a	1
rest	1
from	1
mental	1
work	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
abroad	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
he	1
came	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
May	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
In	1
his	1
judgment	1
the	1
best	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
country	1
life	1
He	1
had	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
enjoy	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
that	1
summer	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
it	1
positively	1
annoyed	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
To	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
the	1
background	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
pleasures	1
endeavors	1
labor	1
To	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
the	1
country	1
meant	1
on	1
one	1
hand	1
rest	1
from	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
valuable	1
antidote	1
to	1
the	1
corrupt	1
influences	1
of	1
town	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
its	1
utility	1
To	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
good	1
first	1
because	1
it	1
afforded	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
labor	1
of	1
the	1
usefulness	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
To	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
particularly	1
good	1
because	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
fitting	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
Moreover	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
rather	1
piqued	1
Konstantin	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
liked	1
the	1
peasantry	1
and	1
he	1
often	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
without	1
affectation	1
or	1
condescension	1
and	1
from	1
every	1
such	1
conversation	1
he	1
would	1
deduce	1
general	1
conclusions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
and	1
in	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
knowing	1
them	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
such	1
an	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
To	1
Konstantin	1
the	1
peasant	1
was	1
simply	1
the	1
chief	1
partner	1
in	1
their	1
common	1
labor	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
almost	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
kinship	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
peasant	1
sucked	1
in	1
probably	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
his	1
peasant	1
nurse	1
still	1
as	1
a	1
fellow	1
worker	1
with	1
him	1
while	1
sometimes	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
the	1
vigor	1
gentleness	1
and	1
justice	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
often	1
when	1
their	1
common	1
labors	1
called	1
for	1
other	1
qualities	1
exasperated	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
for	1
his	1
carelessness	1
lack	1
of	1
method	1
drunkenness	1
and	1
lying	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
whether	1
he	1
liked	1
or	1
didn	1
t	1
like	1
the	1
peasants	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
absolutely	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
what	1
to	1
reply	1
He	1
liked	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
peasants	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
men	1
in	1
general	1
Of	1
course	1
being	1
a	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
he	1
liked	1
men	1
rather	1
than	1
he	1
disliked	1
them	1
and	1
so	1
too	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
But	1
like	1
or	1
dislike	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
something	1
apart	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
not	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
interests	1
were	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
theirs	1
but	1
also	1
because	1
he	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
special	1
qualities	1
or	1
failings	1
distinguishing	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
contrast	1
himself	1
with	1
them	1
Moreover	1
although	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
as	1
farmer	1
and	1
arbitrator	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
as	1
adviser	1
the	1
peasants	1
trusted	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
thirty	1
miles	1
round	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
advice	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
definite	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
liked	1
them	1
For	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
peasantry	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
knew	1
men	1
He	1
was	1
continually	1
watching	1
and	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
peasants	1
whom	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
good	1
and	1
interesting	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
observing	1
new	1
points	1
in	1
them	1
altering	1
his	1
former	1
views	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
forming	1
new	1
ones	1
With	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
praised	1
a	1
country	1
life	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
so	1
too	1
he	1
liked	1
the	1
peasantry	1
in	1
contradistinction	1
to	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
and	1
so	1
too	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
peasantry	1
as	1
something	1
distinct	1
from	1
and	1
opposed	1
to	1
men	1
generally	1
In	1
his	1
methodical	1
brain	1
there	1
were	1
distinctly	1
formulated	1
certain	1
aspects	1
of	1
peasant	1
life	1
deduced	1
partly	1
from	1
that	1
life	1
itself	1
but	1
chiefly	1
from	1
contrast	1
with	1
other	1
modes	1
of	1
life	1
He	1
never	1
changed	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
and	1
his	1
sympathetic	1
attitude	1
towards	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
discussions	1
that	1
arose	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
on	1
their	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
peasantry	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
always	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
precisely	1
because	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
definite	1
ideas	1
about	1
the	1
peasant	1
his	1
character	1
his	1
qualities	1
and	1
his	1
tastes	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
had	1
no	1
definite	1
and	1
unalterable	1
idea	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
their	1
arguments	1
Konstantin	1
was	1
readily	1
convicted	1
of	1
contradicting	1
himself	1
In	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
was	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
with	1
his	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
place	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it	1
in	1
French	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
which	1
though	1
fairly	1
quick	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
consequently	1
filled	1
with	1
contradictions	1
With	1
all	1
the	1
condescension	1
of	1
an	1
elder	1
brother	1
he	1
sometimes	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
true	1
import	1
of	1
things	1
but	1
he	1
derived	1
little	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
arguing	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
him	1
too	1
easily	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
regarded	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
immense	1
intellect	1
and	1
culture	1
as	1
generous	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
special	1
faculty	1
for	1
working	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
the	1
older	1
he	1
became	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
intimately	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
brother	1
the	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
the	1
thought	1
struck	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
faculty	1
of	1
working	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
utterly	1
devoid	1
was	1
possibly	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
quality	1
as	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
something	1
not	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
good	1
honest	1
noble	1
desires	1
and	1
tastes	1
but	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
vital	1
force	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
impulse	1
which	1
drives	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
choose	1
someone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
paths	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
care	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
The	1
better	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
brother	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
worked	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
were	1
not	1
led	1
by	1
an	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
but	1
reasoned	1
from	1
intellectual	1
considerations	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
public	1
affairs	1
and	1
consequently	1
took	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1
Levin	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
this	1
generalization	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
questions	1
affecting	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
or	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
immortality	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
to	1
heart	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
chess	1
problems	1
or	1
the	1
ingenious	1
construction	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
machine	1
Besides	1
this	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
his	1
ease	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
because	1
in	1
summer	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Levin	1
was	1
continually	1
busy	1
with	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
summer	1
day	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
enough	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
while	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
holiday	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
a	1
holiday	1
now	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
no	1
writing	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
intellectual	1
activity	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
concise	1
and	1
eloquent	1
shape	1
the	1
ideas	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
His	1
most	1
usual	1
and	1
natural	1
listener	1
was	1
his	1
brother	1
And	1
so	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
friendliness	1
and	1
directness	1
of	1
their	1
relations	1
Konstantin	1
felt	1
an	1
awkwardness	1
in	1
leaving	1
him	1
alone	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
liked	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
to	1
lie	1
so	1
basking	1
and	1
chatting	1
lazily	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
what	1
a	1
pleasure	1
this	1
rural	1
laziness	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
Not	1
an	1
idea	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
brain	1
as	1
empty	1
as	1
a	1
drum	1
But	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
found	1
it	1
dull	1
sitting	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
carting	1
dung	1
onto	1
the	1
fields	1
not	1
ploughed	1
ready	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
heaping	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
anyhow	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
screw	1
the	1
shares	1
in	1
the	1
ploughs	1
but	1
would	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
off	1
and	1
then	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
ploughs	1
were	1
a	1
silly	1
invention	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
Andreevna	1
plough	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
Come	1
you	1
ve	1
done	1
enough	1
trudging	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
No	1
I	1
must	1
just	1
run	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
Levin	1
would	1
answer	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
run	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
fields	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Early	1
in	1
June	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
the	1
old	1
nurse	1
and	1
housekeeper	1
in	1
carrying	1
to	1
the	1
cellar	1
a	1
jar	1
of	1
mushrooms	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
pickled	1
slipped	1
fell	1
and	1
sprained	1
her	1
wrist	1
The	1
district	1
doctor	1
a	1
talkative	1
young	1
medical	1
student	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
his	1
studies	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
He	1
examined	1
the	1
wrist	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
broken	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Koznishev	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
advanced	1
views	1
of	1
things	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
scandal	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
complaining	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
state	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
had	1
fallen	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
listened	1
attentively	1
asked	1
him	1
questions	1
and	1
roused	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
listener	1
he	1
talked	1
fluently	1
uttered	1
a	1
few	1
keen	1
and	1
weighty	1
observations	1
respectfully	1
appreciated	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
doctor	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
in	1
that	1
eager	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
his	1
brother	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
which	1
always	1
with	1
him	1
followed	1
a	1
brilliant	1
and	1
eager	1
conversation	1
After	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
fishing	1
rod	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
angling	1
and	1
was	1
it	1
seemed	1
proud	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
stupid	1
occupation	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
whose	1
presence	1
was	1
needed	1
in	1
the	1
plough	1
land	1
and	1
meadows	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
the	1
turning	1
point	1
of	1
summer	1
when	1
the	1
crops	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
year	1
are	1
a	1
certainty	1
when	1
one	1
begins	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
sowing	1
for	1
next	1
year	1
and	1
the	1
mowing	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
when	1
the	1
rye	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
ear	1
though	1
its	1
ears	1
are	1
still	1
light	1
not	1
yet	1
full	1
and	1
it	1
waves	1
in	1
gray	1
green	1
billows	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
when	1
the	1
green	1
oats	1
with	1
tufts	1
of	1
yellow	1
grass	1
scattered	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
it	1
droop	1
irregularly	1
over	1
the	1
late	1
sown	1
fields	1
when	1
the	1
early	1
buckwheat	1
is	1
already	1
out	1
and	1
hiding	1
the	1
ground	1
when	1
the	1
fallow	1
lands	1
trodden	1
hard	1
as	1
stone	1
by	1
the	1
cattle	1
are	1
half	1
ploughed	1
over	1
with	1
paths	1
left	1
untouched	1
by	1
the	1
plough	1
when	1
from	1
the	1
dry	1
dung	1
heaps	1
carted	1
onto	1
the	1
fields	1
there	1
comes	1
at	1
sunset	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
manure	1
mixed	1
with	1
meadow	1
sweet	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
low	1
lying	1
lands	1
the	1
riverside	1
meadows	1
are	1
a	1
thick	1
sea	1
of	1
grass	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
mowing	1
with	1
blackened	1
heaps	1
of	1
the	1
stalks	1
of	1
sorrel	1
among	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
there	1
comes	1
a	1
brief	1
pause	1
in	1
the	1
toil	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
before	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
harvest	1
every	1
year	1
recurring	1
every	1
year	1
straining	1
every	1
nerve	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
The	1
crop	1
was	1
a	1
splendid	1
one	1
and	1
bright	1
hot	1
summer	1
days	1
had	1
set	1
in	1
with	1
short	1
dewy	1
nights	1
The	1
brothers	1
had	1
to	1
drive	1
through	1
the	1
woods	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
meadows	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
admiring	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
which	1
were	1
a	1
tangled	1
mass	1
of	1
leaves	1
pointing	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
now	1
an	1
old	1
lime	1
tree	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
flowering	1
dark	1
on	1
the	1
shady	1
side	1
and	1
brightly	1
spotted	1
with	1
yellow	1
stipules	1
now	1
the	1
young	1
shoots	1
of	1
this	1
year	1
s	1
saplings	1
brilliant	1
with	1
emerald	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
talking	1
and	1
hearing	1
about	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
nature	1
Words	1
for	1
him	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
He	1
assented	1
to	1
what	1
his	1
brother	1
said	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
beginning	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
all	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
fallow	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
upland	1
in	1
parts	1
yellow	1
with	1
grass	1
in	1
parts	1
trampled	1
and	1
checkered	1
with	1
furrows	1
in	1
parts	1
dotted	1
with	1
ridges	1
of	1
dung	1
and	1
in	1
parts	1
even	1
ploughed	1
A	1
string	1
of	1
carts	1
was	1
moving	1
across	1
it	1
Levin	1
counted	1
the	1
carts	1
and	1
was	1
pleased	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
wanted	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
meadows	1
his	1
thoughts	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
mowing	1
He	1
always	1
felt	1
something	1
special	1
moving	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
at	1
the	1
hay	1
making	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
meadow	1
Levin	1
stopped	1
the	1
horse	1
The	1
morning	1
dew	1
was	1
still	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
thick	1
undergrowth	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
feet	1
wet	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
asked	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
drive	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
willow	1
tree	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
carp	1
was	1
caught	1
Sorry	1
as	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
to	1
crush	1
down	1
his	1
mowing	1
grass	1
he	1
drove	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
meadow	1
The	1
high	1
grass	1
softly	1
turned	1
about	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
s	1
legs	1
leaving	1
its	1
seeds	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
wet	1
axles	1
and	1
spokes	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
His	1
brother	1
seated	1
himself	1
under	1
a	1
bush	1
arranging	1
his	1
tackle	1
while	1
Levin	1
led	1
the	1
horse	1
away	1
fastened	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
vast	1
gray	1
green	1
sea	1
of	1
grass	1
unstirred	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
The	1
silky	1
grass	1
with	1
its	1
ripe	1
seeds	1
came	1
almost	1
to	1
his	1
waist	1
in	1
the	1
dampest	1
spots	1
Crossing	1
the	1
meadow	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
came	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
met	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
swollen	1
eye	1
carrying	1
a	1
skep	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
What	1
taken	1
a	1
stray	1
swarm	1
Fomitch	1
he	1
asked	1
No	1
indeed	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrich	1
All	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
keep	1
our	1
own	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
swarm	1
that	1
has	1
flown	1
away	1
Luckily	1
the	1
lads	1
caught	1
them	1
They	1
were	1
ploughing	1
your	1
field	1
They	1
unyoked	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
galloped	1
after	1
them	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
Fomitch	1
start	1
mowing	1
or	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
Eh	1
well	1
Our	1
way	1
s	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
St	1
Peter	1
s	1
Day	1
But	1
you	1
always	1
mow	1
sooner	1
Well	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
please	1
God	1
the	1
hay	1
s	1
good	1
There	1
ll	1
be	1
plenty	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
the	1
weather	1
That	1
s	1
in	1
God	1
s	1
hands	1
Maybe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
fine	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
caught	1
nothing	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
bored	1
and	1
seemed	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
stimulated	1
by	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
Levin	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
give	1
orders	1
about	1
getting	1
together	1
the	1
mowers	1
for	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
at	1
rest	1
his	1
doubts	1
about	1
the	1
mowing	1
which	1
greatly	1
absorbed	1
him	1
Well	1
let	1
s	1
be	1
going	1
he	1
said	1
Why	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
Let	1
s	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
But	1
how	1
wet	1
you	1
are	1
Even	1
though	1
one	1
catches	1
nothing	1
it	1
s	1
nice	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
about	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
sport	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
nature	1
How	1
exquisite	1
this	1
steely	1
water	1
is	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
These	1
riverside	1
banks	1
always	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
riddle	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
The	1
grass	1
says	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
we	1
quiver	1
and	1
we	1
quiver	1
I	1
don	1
t	1

the	1
riddle	1

wearily	1
Chapter	1

Do	1
you	1

I	1
ve	1
been	1

about	1
you	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
It	1
s	1
beyond	1
everything	1
what	1
s	1
being	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
district	1
according	1
to	1
what	1
this	1
doctor	1
tells	1
me	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
intelligent	1
fellow	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
ve	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
again	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
for	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
meetings	1
and	1
altogether	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
business	1
If	1
decent	1
people	1
won	1
t	1
go	1
into	1
it	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
s	1
bound	1
to	1
go	1
all	1
wrong	1
We	1
pay	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
it	1
all	1
goes	1
in	1
salaries	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
schools	1
nor	1
district	1
nurses	1
nor	1
midwives	1
nor	1
drugstores	1
nothing	1
Well	1
I	1
did	1
try	1
you	1
know	1
Levin	1
said	1
slowly	1
and	1
unwillingly	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
so	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
But	1
why	1
can	1
t	1
you	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
Indifference	1
incapacity	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
admit	1
surely	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
simply	1
laziness	1
None	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
I	1
ve	1
tried	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
said	1
Levin	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
grasped	1
what	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
saying	1
Looking	1
towards	1
the	1
plough	1
land	1
across	1
the	1
river	1
he	1
made	1
out	1
something	1
black	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
horse	1
or	1
the	1
bailiff	1
on	1
horseback	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
You	1
made	1
an	1
attempt	1
and	1
didn	1
t	1
succeed	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
and	1
you	1
give	1
in	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
self	1
respect	1
Self	1
respect	1
said	1
Levin	1
stung	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
by	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
words	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
If	1
they	1
d	1
told	1
me	1
at	1
college	1
that	1
other	1
people	1
understood	1
the	1
integral	1
calculus	1
and	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
then	1
pride	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
one	1
wants	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
certain	1
qualifications	1
for	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
business	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
business	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
of	1
importance	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
stung	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
too	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
considering	1
anything	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
at	1
his	1
obviously	1
paying	1
little	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
it	1
important	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
answered	1
Levin	1
making	1
out	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
bailiff	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
bailiff	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
letting	1
the	1
peasants	1
go	1
off	1
the	1
ploughed	1
land	1
They	1
were	1
turning	1
the	1
plough	1
over	1
Can	1
they	1
have	1
finished	1
ploughing	1
he	1
wondered	1
Come	1
really	1
though	1
said	1
the	1
elder	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
clever	1
face	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
limit	1
to	1
everything	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
original	1
and	1
genuine	1
and	1
to	1
dislike	1
everything	1
conventional	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
that	1
but	1
really	1
what	1
you	1
re	1
saying	1
either	1
has	1
no	1
meaning	1
or	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
wrong	1
meaning	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
whether	1
the	1
peasant	1
whom	1
you	1
love	1
as	1
you	1
assert	1
I	1
never	1
did	1
assert	1
it	1
thought	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
dies	1
without	1
help	1
The	1
ignorant	1
peasant	1
women	1
starve	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
stagnate	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
are	1
helpless	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
every	1
village	1
clerk	1
while	1
you	1
have	1
at	1
your	1
disposal	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
helping	1
them	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
help	1
them	1
because	1
to	1
your	1
mind	1
it	1
s	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
And	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
put	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
alternative	1
either	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
undeveloped	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
or	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
sacrifice	1
your	1
ease	1
your	1
vanity	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
course	1
open	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
submit	1
or	1
to	1
confess	1
to	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
And	1
this	1
mortified	1
him	1
and	1
hurt	1
his	1
feelings	1
It	1
s	1
both	1
he	1
said	1
resolutely	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
impossible	1
if	1
the	1
money	1
were	1
properly	1
laid	1
out	1
to	1
provide	1
medical	1
aid	1
Impossible	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
For	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
square	1
miles	1
of	1
our	1
district	1
what	1
with	1
our	1
thaws	1
and	1
the	1
storms	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
provide	1
medical	1
aid	1
all	1
over	1
And	1
besides	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
medicine	1
Oh	1
well	1
that	1
s	1
unfair	1
I	1
can	1
quote	1
to	1
you	1
thousands	1
of	1
instances	1
But	1
the	1
schools	1
anyway	1
Why	1
have	1
schools	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Can	1
there	1
be	1
two	1
opinions	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
education	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
for	1
everyone	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
felt	1
himself	1
morally	1
pinned	1
against	1
a	1
wall	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
got	1
hot	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
blurted	1
out	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
indifference	1
to	1
public	1
business	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
worry	1
myself	1
about	1
establishing	1
dispensaries	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
and	1
schools	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
send	1
my	1
children	1
to	1
which	1
even	1
the	1
peasants	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
send	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
very	1
firm	1
faith	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
said	1
he	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
unexpected	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
he	1
promptly	1
made	1
a	1
new	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
hook	1
threw	1
it	1
in	1
again	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
smiling	1
Come	1
now	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
the	1
dispensary	1
is	1
needed	1
We	1
ourselves	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
district	1
doctor	1
for	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
Oh	1
well	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
her	1
wrist	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
straight	1
again	1
That	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
proved	1
Next	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
workman	1
of	1
more	1
use	1
and	1
value	1
to	1
you	1
No	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
anyone	1
you	1
like	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
answered	1
with	1
decision	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
is	1
much	1
inferior	1
as	1
a	1
workman	1
And	1
mending	1
the	1
highroads	1
is	1
an	1
impossibility	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
put	1
up	1
bridges	1
they	1
re	1
stolen	1
Still	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
frowning	1
He	1
disliked	1
contradiction	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
arguments	1
that	1
were	1
continually	1
skipping	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another	1
introducing	1
new	1
and	1
disconnected	1
points	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
knowing	1
to	1
which	1
to	1
reply	1
Do	1
you	1
admit	1
that	1
education	1
is	1
a	1
benefit	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
Yes	1
I	1
admit	1
it	1
said	1
Levin	1
without	1
thinking	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
immediately	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
admitted	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
meaningless	1
rubbish	1
How	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proved	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
inevitably	1
be	1
logically	1
proved	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
proofs	1
The	1
argument	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
simpler	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
If	1
you	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
benefit	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
then	1
as	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
you	1
cannot	1
help	1
caring	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
sympathizing	1
with	1
the	1
movement	1
and	1
so	1
wishing	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
it	1
But	1
I	1
still	1
do	1
not	1
admit	1
this	1
movement	1
to	1
be	1
just	1
said	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
reddening	1
a	1
little	1
What	1
But	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
That	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
admit	1
it	1
s	1
being	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
possible	1
That	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
without	1
making	1
the	1
trial	1
Well	1
supposing	1
that	1
s	1
so	1
said	1
Levin	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
suppose	1
so	1
at	1
all	1
supposing	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
still	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
what	1
I	1
m	1
to	1
worry	1
myself	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
How	1
so	1
No	1
since	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
philosophical	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
said	1
Levin	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
where	1
philosophy	1
comes	1
in	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
Levin	1
fancied	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
right	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
philosophy	1
And	1
that	1
irritated	1
Levin	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
heat	1
I	1
imagine	1
the	1
mainspring	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
actions	1
is	1
after	1
all	1
self	1
interest	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
institutions	1
I	1
as	1
a	1
nobleman	1
see	1
nothing	1
that	1
could	1
conduce	1
to	1
my	1
prosperity	1
and	1
the	1
roads	1
are	1
not	1
better	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
my	1
horses	1
carry	1
me	1
well	1
enough	1
over	1
bad	1
ones	1
Doctors	1
and	1
dispensaries	1
are	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
An	1
arbitrator	1
of	1
disputes	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
never	1
appeal	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
appeal	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
schools	1
are	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
positively	1
harmful	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
For	1
me	1
the	1
district	1
institutions	1
simply	1
mean	1
the	1
liability	1
to	1
pay	1
fourpence	1
halfpenny	1
for	1
every	1
three	1
acres	1
to	1
drive	1
into	1
the	1
town	1
sleep	1
with	1
bugs	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
idiocy	1
and	1
loathsomeness	1
and	1
self	1
interest	1
offers	1
me	1
no	1
inducement	1
Excuse	1
me	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
interposed	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
self	1
interest	1
did	1
not	1
induce	1
us	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
the	1
serfs	1
but	1
we	1
did	1
work	1
for	1
it	1
No	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
broke	1
in	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
heat	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
the	1
serfs	1
was	1
a	1
different	1
matter	1
There	1
self	1
interest	1
did	1
come	1
in	1
One	1
longed	1
to	1
throw	1
off	1
that	1
yoke	1
that	1
crushed	1
us	1
all	1
decent	1
people	1
among	1
us	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
town	1
councilor	1
and	1
discuss	1
how	1
many	1
dustmen	1
are	1
needed	1
and	1
how	1
chimneys	1
shall	1
be	1
constructed	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
live	1
to	1
serve	1
on	1
a	1
jury	1
and	1
try	1
a	1
peasant	1
who	1
s	1
stolen	1
a	1
flitch	1
of	1
bacon	1
and	1
listen	1
for	1
six	1
hours	1
at	1
a	1
stretch	1
to	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
jabber	1
from	1
the	1
counsel	1
for	1
the	1
defense	1
and	1
the	1
prosecution	1
and	1
the	1
president	1
cross	1
examining	1
my	1
old	1
half	1
witted	1
Alioshka	1
Do	1
you	1
admit	1
prisoner	1
in	1
the	1
dock	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
bacon	1
Eh	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
had	1
warmed	1
to	1
his	1
subject	1
and	1
began	1
mimicking	1
the	1
president	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
witted	1
Alioshka	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
But	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
then	1
I	1
simply	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
those	1
rights	1
that	1
touch	1
me	1
my	1
interest	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
defend	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
made	1
raids	1
on	1
us	1
students	1
and	1
the	1
police	1
read	1
our	1
letters	1
I	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
defend	1
those	1
rights	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
to	1
defend	1
my	1
rights	1
to	1
education	1
and	1
freedom	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
compulsory	1
military	1
service	1
which	1
affects	1
my	1
children	1
my	1
brothers	1
and	1
myself	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
deliberate	1
on	1
what	1
concerns	1
me	1
but	1
deliberating	1
on	1
how	1
to	1
spend	1
forty	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
of	1
district	1
council	1
money	1
or	1
judging	1
the	1
half	1
witted	1
Alioshka	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
spoke	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
floodgates	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
had	1
burst	1
open	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiled	1
But	1
tomorrow	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
suited	1
your	1
tastes	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
criminal	1
tribunal	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
murder	1
anybody	1
and	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
it	1
Well	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
flying	1
off	1
again	1
to	1
a	1
subject	1
quite	1
beside	1
the	1
point	1
our	1
district	1
self	1
government	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
birch	1
branches	1
we	1
stick	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
Trinity	1
Day	1
for	1
instance	1
to	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
copse	1
which	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
gush	1
over	1
these	1
birch	1
branches	1
and	1
believe	1
in	1
them	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
wonder	1
how	1
the	1
birch	1
branches	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
their	1
argument	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
really	1
understand	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
his	1
brother	1
meant	1
Excuse	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
one	1
really	1
can	1
t	1
argue	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
he	1
observed	1
But	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
wanted	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
failing	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
lack	1
of	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
imagine	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
activity	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
lasting	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
self	1
interest	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
universal	1
principle	1
a	1
philosophical	1
principle	1
he	1
said	1
repeating	1
the	1
word	1
philosophical	1
with	1
determination	1
as	1
though	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
right	1
as	1
anyone	1
else	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
philosophy	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiled	1
He	1
too	1
has	1
a	1
philosophy	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
at	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
his	1
natural	1
tendencies	1
he	1
thought	1
Come	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
let	1
philosophy	1
alone	1
he	1
said	1
The	1
chief	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
philosophy	1
of	1
all	1
ages	1
consists	1
just	1
in	1
finding	1
the	1
indispensable	1
connection	1
which	1
exists	1
between	1
individual	1
and	1
social	1
interests	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
a	1
correction	1
I	1
must	1
make	1
in	1
your	1
comparison	1
The	1
birches	1
are	1
not	1
simply	1
stuck	1
in	1
but	1
some	1
are	1
sown	1
and	1
some	1
are	1
planted	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
deal	1
carefully	1
with	1
them	1
It	1
s	1
only	1
those	1
peoples	1
that	1
have	1
an	1
intuitive	1
sense	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
of	1
importance	1
and	1
significance	1
in	1
their	1
institutions	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
value	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
a	1
future	1
before	1
them	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
those	1
peoples	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
truly	1
call	1
historical	1
And	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
carried	1
the	1
subject	1
into	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
philosophical	1
history	1
where	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
follow	1
him	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
incorrectness	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
As	1
for	1
your	1
dislike	1
of	1
it	1
excuse	1
my	1
saying	1
so	1
that	1
s	1
simply	1
our	1
Russian	1
sloth	1
and	1
old	1
serf	1
owner	1
s	1
ways	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
convinced	1
that	1
in	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
temporary	1
error	1
and	1
will	1
pass	1
Konstantin	1
was	1
silent	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
vanquished	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
was	1
unintelligible	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Only	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
unintelligible	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
capable	1
of	1
expressing	1
his	1
meaning	1
clearly	1
or	1
because	1
his	1
brother	1
would	1
not	1
or	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
pursue	1
the	1
speculation	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
musing	1
on	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
and	1
personal	1
matter	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
wound	1
up	1
the	1
last	1
line	1
untied	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
they	1
drove	1
off	1
Chapter	1
4	1
The	1
personal	1
matter	1
that	1
absorbed	1
Levin	1
during	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
this	1
Once	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
year	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
mowing	1
and	1
being	1
made	1
very	1
angry	1
by	1
the	1
bailiff	1
he	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
favorite	1
means	1
for	1
regaining	1
his	1
temper	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
scythe	1
from	1
a	1
peasant	1
and	1
began	1
mowing	1
He	1
liked	1
the	1
work	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
tried	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
mowing	1
since	1
He	1
had	1
cut	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
this	1
year	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
early	1
spring	1
he	1
had	1
cherished	1
a	1
plan	1
for	1
mowing	1
for	1
whole	1
days	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
Ever	1
since	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
arrival	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
mow	1
or	1
not	1
He	1
was	1
loath	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
brother	1
alone	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
his	1
brother	1
would	1
laugh	1
at	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
recalled	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
mowing	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
deciding	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
mowing	1
After	1
the	1
irritating	1
discussion	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
pondered	1
over	1
this	1
intention	1
again	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
physical	1
exercise	1
or	1
my	1
temper	1
ll	1
certainly	1
be	1
ruined	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
he	1
determined	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
mowing	1
however	1
awkward	1
he	1
might	1
feel	1
about	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
or	1
the	1
peasants	1
Towards	1
evening	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
counting	1
house	1
gave	1
directions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
sent	1
about	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
summon	1
the	1
mowers	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
to	1
cut	1
the	1
hay	1
in	1
Kalinov	1
meadow	1
the	1
largest	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
grass	1
lands	1
And	1
send	1
my	1
scythe	1
please	1
to	1
Tit	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
round	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
maybe	1
do	1
some	1
mowing	1
myself	1
too	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
embarrassed	1
The	1
bailiff	1
smiled	1
and	1
said	1
Yes	1
sir	1
At	1
tea	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
I	1
fancy	1
the	1
fine	1
weather	1
will	1
last	1
Tomorrow	1
I	1
shall	1
start	1
mowing	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
field	1
labor	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
m	1
awfully	1
fond	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
sometimes	1
mow	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
try	1
mowing	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
with	1
interest	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Just	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
pleasant	1
said	1
Levin	1
It	1
s	1
splendid	1
as	1
exercise	1
only	1
you	1
ll	1
hardly	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
it	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
without	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
irony	1
I	1
ve	1
tried	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
hard	1
work	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
you	1
get	1
into	1
it	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
shall	1
manage	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
Really	1
what	1
an	1
idea	1
But	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
do	1
the	1
peasants	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
I	1
suppose	1
they	1
laugh	1
in	1
their	1
sleeves	1
at	1
their	1
master	1
s	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
queer	1
fish	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
so	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
delightful	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
such	1
hard	1
work	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
about	1
dining	1
with	1
them	1
To	1
send	1
you	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
Lafitte	1
and	1
roast	1
turkey	1
out	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
awkward	1
No	1
I	1
ll	1
simply	1
come	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
noonday	1
rest	1
Next	1
morning	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
detained	1
giving	1
directions	1
on	1
the	1
farm	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
mowing	1
grass	1
the	1
mowers	1
were	1
already	1
at	1
their	1
second	1
row	1
From	1
the	1
uplands	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
shaded	1
cut	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
below	1
with	1
its	1
grayish	1
ridges	1
of	1
cut	1
grass	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
heaps	1
of	1
coats	1
taken	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
mowers	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
started	1
cutting	1
Gradually	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
towards	1
the	1
meadow	1
the	1
peasants	1
came	1
into	1
sight	1
some	1
in	1
coats	1
some	1
in	1
their	1
shirts	1
mowing	1
one	1
behind	1
another	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
string	1
swinging	1
their	1
scythes	1
differently	1
He	1
counted	1
forty	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
They	1
were	1
mowing	1
slowly	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
low	1
lying	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
where	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
old	1
dam	1
Levin	1
recognized	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
men	1
Here	1
was	1
old	1
Yermil	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
white	1
smock	1
bending	1
forward	1
to	1
swing	1
a	1
scythe	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
Vaska	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
coachman	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
taking	1
every	1
row	1
with	1
a	1
wide	1
sweep	1
Here	1
too	1
was	1
Tit	1
Levin	1
s	1
preceptor	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
mowing	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
peasant	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
cut	1
his	1
wide	1
row	1
without	1
bending	1
as	1
though	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
scythe	1
Levin	1
got	1
off	1
his	1
mare	1
and	1
fastening	1
her	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roadside	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
Tit	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
second	1
scythe	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
bush	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
ready	1
sir	1
it	1
s	1
like	1
a	1
razor	1
cuts	1
of	1
itself	1
said	1
Tit	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
scythe	1
Levin	1
took	1
the	1
scythe	1
and	1
began	1
trying	1
it	1
As	1
they	1
finished	1
their	1
rows	1
the	1
mowers	1
hot	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
road	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
and	1
laughing	1
a	1
little	1
greeted	1
the	1
master	1
They	1
all	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
made	1
any	1
remark	1
till	1
a	1
tall	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
wrinkled	1
beardless	1
face	1
wearing	1
a	1
short	1
sheepskin	1
jacket	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
accosted	1
him	1
Look	1
ee	1
now	1
master	1
once	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
rope	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
letting	1
it	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
Levin	1
heard	1
smothered	1
laughter	1
among	1
the	1
mowers	1
I	1
ll	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
taking	1
his	1
stand	1
behind	1
Tit	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
begin	1
Mind	1
ee	1
repeated	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Tit	1
made	1
room	1
and	1
Levin	1
started	1
behind	1
him	1
The	1
grass	1
was	1
short	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
any	1
mowing	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
the	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
upon	1
him	1
cut	1
badly	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
moments	1
though	1
he	1
swung	1
his	1
scythe	1
vigorously	1
Behind	1
him	1
he	1
heard	1
voices	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
set	1
right	1
handle	1
s	1
too	1
high	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
stoop	1
to	1
it	1
said	1
one	1
Press	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
heel	1
said	1
another	1
Never	1
mind	1
he	1
ll	1
get	1
on	1
all	1
right	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
resumed	1
He	1
s	1
made	1
a	1
start	1
You	1
swing	1
it	1
too	1
wide	1
you	1
ll	1
tire	1
yourself	1
out	1
The	1
master	1
sure	1
does	1
his	1
best	1
for	1
himself	1
But	1
see	1
the	1
grass	1
missed	1
out	1
For	1
such	1
work	1
us	1
fellows	1
would	1
catch	1
it	1
The	1
grass	1
became	1
softer	1
and	1
Levin	1
listening	1
without	1
answering	1
followed	1
Tit	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
They	1
moved	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
Tit	1
kept	1
moving	1
on	1
without	1
stopping	1
not	1
showing	1
the	1
slightest	1
weariness	1
but	1
Levin	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
he	1
swung	1
his	1
scythe	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
was	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
ask	1
Tit	1
to	1
stop	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
Tit	1
stopped	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
and	1
stooping	1
down	1
picked	1
up	1
some	1
grass	1
rubbed	1
his	1
scythe	1
and	1
began	1
whetting	1
it	1
Levin	1
straightened	1
himself	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
looked	1
round	1
Behind	1
him	1
came	1
a	1
peasant	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
evidently	1
tired	1
for	1
he	1
stopped	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
mow	1
up	1
to	1
Levin	1
and	1
began	1
whetting	1
his	1
scythe	1
Tit	1
sharpened	1
his	1
scythe	1
and	1
Levin	1
s	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
The	1
next	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
Tit	1
moved	1
on	1
with	1
sweep	1
after	1
sweep	1
of	1
his	1
scythe	1
not	1
stopping	1
nor	1
showing	1
signs	1
of	1
weariness	1
Levin	1
followed	1
him	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
get	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
harder	1
and	1
harder	1
the	1
moment	1
came	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
strength	1
left	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
Tit	1
stopped	1
and	1
whetted	1
the	1
scythes	1
So	1
they	1
mowed	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
And	1
this	1
long	1
row	1
seemed	1
particularly	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
Levin	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
reached	1
and	1
Tit	1
shouldering	1
his	1
scythe	1
began	1
with	1
deliberate	1
stride	1
returning	1
on	1
the	1
tracks	1
left	1
by	1
his	1
heels	1
in	1
the	1
cut	1
grass	1
and	1
Levin	1
walked	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
over	1
the	1
space	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
sweat	1
that	1
ran	1
in	1
streams	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
drops	1
down	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
drenched	1
his	1
back	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
soaked	1
in	1
water	1
he	1
felt	1
very	1
happy	1
What	1
delighted	1
him	1
particularly	1
was	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
out	1
His	1
pleasure	1
was	1
only	1
disturbed	1
by	1
his	1
row	1
not	1
being	1
well	1
cut	1
I	1
will	1
swing	1
less	1
with	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
more	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
body	1
he	1
thought	1
comparing	1
Tit	1
s	1
row	1
which	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
unevenly	1
and	1
irregularly	1
lying	1
grass	1
The	1
first	1
row	1
as	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
Tit	1
had	1
mowed	1
specially	1
quickly	1
probably	1
wishing	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
and	1
the	1
row	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
long	1
one	1
The	1
next	1
rows	1
were	1
easier	1
but	1
still	1
Levin	1
had	1
to	1
strain	1
every	1
nerve	1
not	1
to	1
drop	1
behind	1
the	1
peasants	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
work	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
possible	1
He	1
heard	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
swish	1
of	1
scythes	1
and	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
Tit	1
s	1
upright	1
figure	1
mowing	1
away	1
the	1
crescent	1
shaped	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
cut	1
grass	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
flower	1
heads	1
slowly	1
and	1
rhythmically	1
falling	1
before	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
his	1
scythe	1
and	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
row	1
where	1
would	1
come	1
the	1
rest	1
Suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
toil	1
without	1
understanding	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
or	1
whence	1
it	1
came	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sensation	1
of	1
chill	1
on	1
his	1
hot	1
moist	1
shoulders	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
for	1
whetting	1
the	1
scythes	1
A	1
heavy	1
lowering	1
storm	1
cloud	1
had	1
blown	1
up	1
and	1
big	1
raindrops	1
were	1
falling	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
coats	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
others	1
just	1
like	1
Levin	1
himself	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
their	1
shoulders	1
enjoying	1
the	1
pleasant	1
coolness	1
of	1
it	1
Another	1
row	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
row	1
followed	1
long	1
rows	1
and	1
short	1
rows	1
with	1
good	1
grass	1
and	1
with	1
poor	1
grass	1
Levin	1
lost	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
told	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
or	1
early	1
now	1
A	1
change	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
immense	1
satisfaction	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
toil	1
there	1
were	1
moments	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
forgot	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
all	1
easy	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
those	1
same	1
moments	1
his	1
row	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
smooth	1
and	1
well	1
cut	1
as	1
Tit	1
s	1
But	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
recollected	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
began	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
better	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
conscious	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
his	1
task	1
and	1
the	1
row	1
was	1
badly	1
mown	1
On	1
finishing	1
yet	1
another	1
row	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
again	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
next	1
but	1
Tit	1
stopped	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
They	1
both	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
What	1
are	1
they	1
talking	1
about	1
and	1
why	1
doesn	1
t	1
he	1
go	1
back	1
thought	1
Levin	1
not	1
guessing	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
been	1
mowing	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
four	1
hours	1
without	1
stopping	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
their	1
lunch	1
Lunch	1
sir	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Is	1
it	1
really	1
time	1
That	1
s	1
right	1
lunch	1
then	1
Levin	1
gave	1
his	1
scythe	1
to	1
Tit	1
and	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
long	1
stretch	1
of	1
mown	1
grass	1
slightly	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
rain	1
to	1
get	1
their	1
bread	1
from	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
coats	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
his	1
house	1
Only	1
then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
awoke	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wrong	1
about	1
the	1
weather	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
drenching	1
his	1
hay	1
The	1
hay	1
will	1
be	1
spoiled	1
he	1
said	1
Not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it	1
sir	1
mow	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
rake	1
in	1
fine	1
weather	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Levin	1
untied	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
coffee	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
getting	1
up	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
his	1
coffee	1
Levin	1
rode	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
mowing	1
before	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
Chapter	1
5	1
After	1
lunch	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
mowers	1
as	1
before	1
but	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
accosted	1
him	1
jocosely	1
and	1
now	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
neighbor	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
mowing	1
this	1
summer	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
holding	1
himself	1
erect	1
moved	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
turned	1
out	1
taking	1
long	1
regular	1
strides	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
precise	1
and	1
regular	1
action	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
cost	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
effort	1
than	1
swinging	1
one	1
s	1
arms	1
in	1
walking	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
play	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
even	1
row	1
of	1
grass	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
the	1
sharp	1
scythe	1
of	1
itself	1
swishing	1
through	1
the	1
juicy	1
grass	1
Behind	1
Levin	1
came	1
the	1
lad	1
Mishka	1
His	1
pretty	1
boyish	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
twist	1
of	1
fresh	1
grass	1
bound	1
round	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
all	1
working	1
with	1
effort	1
but	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
smiled	1
He	1
would	1
clearly	1
have	1
died	1
sooner	1
than	1
own	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
work	1
for	1
him	1
Levin	1
kept	1
between	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
mowing	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
such	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
perspiration	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
drenched	1
cooled	1
him	1
while	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
burned	1
his	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
bare	1
to	1
the	1
elbow	1
gave	1
a	1
vigor	1
and	1
dogged	1
energy	1
to	1
his	1
labor	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
now	1
came	1
those	1
moments	1
of	1
unconsciousness	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
one	1
was	1
doing	1
The	1
scythe	1
cut	1
of	1
itself	1
These	1
were	1
happy	1
moments	1
Still	1
more	1
delightful	1
were	1
the	1
moments	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
stream	1
where	1
the	1
rows	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
rubbed	1
his	1
scythe	1
with	1
the	1
wet	1
thick	1
grass	1
rinsed	1
its	1
blade	1
in	1
the	1
fresh	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
ladled	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
a	1
tin	1
dipper	1
and	1
offered	1
Levin	1
a	1
drink	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
home	1
brew	1
eh	1
Good	1
eh	1
said	1
he	1
winking	1
And	1
truly	1
Levin	1
had	1
never	1
drunk	1
any	1
liquor	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
this	1
warm	1
water	1
with	1
green	1
bits	1
floating	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
rust	1
from	1
the	1
tin	1
dipper	1
And	1
immediately	1
after	1
this	1
came	1
the	1
delicious	1
slow	1
saunter	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
scythe	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
wipe	1
away	1
the	1
streaming	1
sweat	1
take	1
deep	1
breaths	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
look	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
long	1
string	1
of	1
mowers	1
and	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
around	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
The	1
longer	1
Levin	1
mowed	1
the	1
oftener	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
unconsciousness	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
seemed	1
not	1
his	1
hands	1
that	1
swung	1
the	1
scythe	1
but	1
the	1
scythe	1
mowing	1
of	1
itself	1
a	1
body	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
consciousness	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
magic	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
work	1
turned	1
out	1
regular	1
and	1
well	1
finished	1
of	1
itself	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
blissful	1
moments	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
hard	1
work	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
the	1
motion	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
unconscious	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
mow	1
round	1
a	1
hillock	1
or	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
sorrel	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
did	1
this	1
easily	1
When	1
a	1
hillock	1
came	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
action	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
heel	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
with	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
scythe	1
clipped	1
the	1
hillock	1
round	1
both	1
sides	1
with	1
short	1
strokes	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
he	1
kept	1
looking	1
about	1
and	1
watching	1
what	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
view	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
he	1
picked	1
a	1
wild	1
berry	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
or	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
Levin	1
then	1
he	1
flung	1
away	1
a	1
twig	1
with	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
the	1
scythe	1
then	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
quail	1
s	1
nest	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
bird	1
flew	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
scythe	1
or	1
caught	1
a	1
snake	1
that	1
crossed	1
his	1
path	1
and	1
lifting	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
scythe	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
a	1
fork	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
Levin	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away	1
For	1
both	1
Levin	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
peasant	1
behind	1
him	1
such	1
changes	1
of	1
position	1
were	1
difficult	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
repeating	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
same	1
strained	1
movement	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
perfect	1
frenzy	1
of	1
toil	1
and	1
were	1
incapable	1
of	1
shifting	1
their	1
position	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
them	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
how	1
time	1
was	1
passing	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
working	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
dinner	1
time	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
cut	1
grass	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
called	1
Levin	1
s	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girls	1
and	1
boys	1
who	1
were	1
coming	1
from	1
different	1
directions	1
hardly	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
long	1
grass	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
towards	1
the	1
mowers	1
carrying	1
sacks	1
of	1
bread	1
dragging	1
at	1
their	1
little	1
hands	1
and	1
pitchers	1
of	1
the	1
sour	1
rye	1
beer	1
with	1
cloths	1
wrapped	1
round	1
them	1
Look	1
ee	1
the	1
little	1
emmets	1
crawling	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
shaded	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
They	1
mowed	1
two	1
more	1
rows	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
stopped	1
Come	1
master	1
dinner	1
time	1
he	1
said	1
briskly	1
And	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
stream	1
the	1
mowers	1
moved	1
off	1
across	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
cut	1
grass	1
towards	1
their	1
pile	1
of	1
coats	1
where	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
dinners	1
were	1
sitting	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
The	1
peasants	1
gathered	1
into	1
groups	1
those	1
further	1
away	1
under	1
a	1
cart	1
those	1
nearer	1
under	1
a	1
willow	1
bush	1
Levin	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
them	1
he	1
felt	1
disinclined	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
All	1
constraint	1
with	1
the	1
master	1
had	1
disappeared	1
long	1
ago	1
The	1
peasants	1
got	1
ready	1
for	1
dinner	1
Some	1
washed	1
the	1
young	1
lads	1
bathed	1
in	1
the	1
stream	1
others	1
made	1
a	1
place	1
comfortable	1
for	1
a	1
rest	1
untied	1
their	1
sacks	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
uncovered	1
the	1
pitchers	1
of	1
rye	1
beer	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
crumbled	1
up	1
some	1
bread	1
in	1
a	1
cup	1
stirred	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
a	1
spoon	1
poured	1
water	1
on	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
dipper	1
broke	1
up	1
some	1
more	1
bread	1
and	1
having	1
seasoned	1
it	1
with	1
salt	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
say	1
his	1
prayer	1
Come	1
master	1
taste	1
my	1
sop	1
said	1
he	1
kneeling	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
cup	1
The	1
sop	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
Levin	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
going	1
home	1
He	1
dined	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
family	1
affairs	1
taking	1
the	1
keenest	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
He	1
felt	1
much	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
affection	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
When	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
again	1
said	1
his	1
prayer	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
under	1
a	1
bush	1
putting	1
some	1
grass	1
under	1
his	1
head	1
for	1
a	1
pillow	1
Levin	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
clinging	1
flies	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
persistent	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
midges	1
that	1
tickled	1
his	1
hot	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
only	1
waked	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bush	1
and	1
reached	1
him	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
awake	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
whetting	1
the	1
scythes	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
lads	1
Levin	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
hardly	1
recognized	1
the	1
place	1
everything	1
was	1
so	1
changed	1
The	1
immense	1
stretch	1
of	1
meadow	1
had	1
been	1
mown	1
and	1
was	1
sparkling	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
fresh	1
brilliance	1
with	1
its	1
lines	1
of	1
already	1
sweet	1
smelling	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
slanting	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
sun	1
And	1
the	1
bushes	1
about	1
the	1
river	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
itself	1
not	1
visible	1
before	1
now	1
gleaming	1
like	1
steel	1
in	1
its	1
bends	1
and	1
the	1
moving	1
ascending	1
peasants	1
and	1
the	1
sharp	1
wall	1
of	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
unmown	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
the	1
hawks	1
hovering	1
over	1
the	1
stripped	1
meadow	1
all	1
was	1
perfectly	1
new	1
Raising	1
himself	1
Levin	1
began	1
considering	1
how	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
could	1
still	1
be	1
done	1
that	1
day	1
The	1
work	1
done	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
much	1
for	1
forty	1
two	1
men	1
They	1
had	1
cut	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
meadow	1
which	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
serf	1
labor	1
taken	1
thirty	1
scythes	1
two	1
days	1
to	1
mow	1
Only	1
the	1
corners	1
remained	1
to	1
do	1
where	1
the	1
rows	1
were	1
short	1
But	1
Levin	1
felt	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
much	1
mowing	1
done	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
was	1
vexed	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
sinking	1
so	1
quickly	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
He	1
felt	1
no	1
weariness	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
work	1
done	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
quickly	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
done	1
as	1
possible	1
Could	1
you	1
cut	1
Mashkin	1
Upland	1
too	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
As	1
God	1
wills	1
the	1
sun	1
s	1
not	1
high	1
A	1
little	1
vodka	1
for	1
the	1
lads	1
At	1
the	1
afternoon	1
rest	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
smoked	1
had	1
lighted	1
their	1
pipes	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
told	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
Mashkin	1
Upland	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
there	1
ll	1
be	1
some	1
vodka	1
Why	1
not	1
cut	1
it	1
Come	1
on	1
Tit	1
We	1
ll	1
look	1
sharp	1
We	1
can	1
eat	1
at	1
night	1
Come	1
on	1
cried	1
voices	1
and	1
eating	1
up	1
their	1
bread	1
the	1
mowers	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
work	1
Come	1
lads	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
said	1
Tit	1
and	1
ran	1
on	1
ahead	1
almost	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
Get	1
along	1
get	1
along	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
hurrying	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
easily	1
overtaking	1
him	1
I	1
ll	1
mow	1
you	1
down	1
look	1
out	1
And	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
mowed	1
away	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
racing	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
But	1
however	1
fast	1
they	1
worked	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
spoil	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
the	1
rows	1
were	1
laid	1
just	1
as	1
neatly	1
and	1
exactly	1
The	1
little	1
piece	1
left	1
uncut	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
was	1
mown	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
mowers	1
were	1
just	1
ending	1
their	1
rows	1
while	1
the	1
foremost	1
snatched	1
up	1
their	1
coats	1
onto	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
crossed	1
the	1
road	1
towards	1
Mashkin	1
Upland	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
already	1
sinking	1
into	1
the	1
trees	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
with	1
their	1
jingling	1
dippers	1
into	1
the	1
wooded	1
ravine	1
of	1
Mashkin	1
Upland	1
The	1
grass	1
was	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
waists	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hollow	1
soft	1
tender	1
and	1
feathery	1
spotted	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
with	1
wild	1
heart	1
s	1
ease	1
After	1
a	1
brief	1
consultation	1
whether	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
rows	1
lengthwise	1
or	1
diagonally	1
Prohor	1
Yermilin	1
also	1
a	1
renowned	1
mower	1
a	1
huge	1
black	1
haired	1
peasant	1
went	1
on	1
ahead	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
started	1
mowing	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
proceeded	1
to	1
form	1
in	1
line	1
behind	1
him	1
going	1
downhill	1
through	1
the	1
hollow	1
and	1
uphill	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
The	1
sun	1
sank	1
behind	1
the	1
forest	1
The	1
dew	1
was	1
falling	1
by	1
now	1
the	1
mowers	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
hillside	1
but	1
below	1
where	1
a	1
mist	1
was	1
rising	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
they	1
mowed	1
into	1
the	1
fresh	1
dewy	1
shade	1
The	1
work	1
went	1
rapidly	1
The	1
grass	1
cut	1
with	1
a	1
juicy	1
sound	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
laid	1
in	1
high	1
fragrant	1
rows	1
The	1
mowers	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
brought	1
closer	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
row	1
kept	1
urging	1
one	1
another	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
jingling	1
dippers	1
and	1
clanging	1
scythes	1
and	1
the	1
hiss	1
of	1
the	1
whetstones	1
sharpening	1
them	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
shouts	1
Levin	1
still	1
kept	1
between	1
the	1
young	1
peasant	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
short	1
sheepskin	1
jacket	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
humored	1
jocose	1
and	1
free	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
Among	1
the	1
trees	1
they	1
were	1
continually	1
cutting	1
with	1
their	1
scythes	1
the	1
so	1
called	1
birch	1
mushrooms	1
swollen	1
fat	1
in	1
the	1
succulent	1
grass	1
But	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
bent	1
down	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
a	1
mushroom	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
bosom	1
Another	1
present	1
for	1
my	1
old	1
woman	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
Easy	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
mow	1
the	1
wet	1
soft	1
grass	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
work	1
going	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ravine	1
But	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Swinging	1
his	1
scythe	1
just	1
as	1
ever	1
and	1
moving	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
their	1
big	1
plaited	1
shoes	1
with	1
firm	1
little	1
steps	1
he	1
climbed	1
slowly	1
up	1
the	1
steep	1
place	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
breeches	1
hanging	1
out	1
below	1
his	1
smock	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
frame	1
trembled	1
with	1
effort	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
one	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
or	1
one	1
mushroom	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
kept	1
making	1
jokes	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
walked	1
after	1
him	1
and	1
often	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
fall	1
as	1
he	1
climbed	1
with	1
a	1
scythe	1
up	1
a	1
steep	1
cliff	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
clamber	1
without	1
anything	1
But	1
he	1
climbed	1
up	1
and	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
external	1
force	1
were	1
moving	1
him	1
Chapter	1
6	1
Mashkin	1
Upland	1
was	1
mown	1
the	1
last	1
row	1
finished	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
their	1
coats	1
and	1
were	1
gaily	1
trudging	1
home	1
Levin	1
got	1
on	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
parting	1
regretfully	1
from	1
the	1
peasants	1
rode	1
homewards	1
On	1
the	1
hillside	1
he	1
looked	1
back	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
that	1
had	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
valley	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
rough	1
good	1
humored	1
voices	1
laughter	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
clanking	1
scythes	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
finished	1
dinner	1
and	1
was	1
drinking	1
iced	1
lemon	1
and	1
water	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
reviews	1
and	1
papers	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
received	1
by	1
post	1
when	1
Levin	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
talking	1
merrily	1
with	1
his	1
wet	1
and	1
matted	1
hair	1
sticking	1
to	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
chest	1
grimed	1
and	1
moist	1
We	1
mowed	1
the	1
whole	1
meadow	1
Oh	1
it	1
is	1
nice	1
delicious	1
And	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
getting	1
on	1
said	1
Levin	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
Mercy	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
like	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
looking	1
round	1
with	1
some	1
dissatisfaction	1
And	1
the	1
door	1
do	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
cried	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
let	1
in	1
a	1
dozen	1
at	1
least	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
flies	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
he	1
never	1
opened	1
the	1
window	1
except	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
carefully	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
Not	1
one	1
on	1
my	1
honor	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
I	1
ll	1
catch	1
them	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
what	1
a	1
pleasure	1
it	1
is	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
spent	1
the	1
day	1
Very	1
well	1
But	1
have	1
you	1
really	1
been	1
mowing	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
re	1
as	1
hungry	1
as	1
a	1
wolf	1
Kouzma	1
has	1
got	1
everything	1
ready	1
for	1
you	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
hungry	1
even	1
I	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
there	1
But	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
wash	1
Yes	1
go	1
along	1
go	1
along	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
directly	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
Go	1
along	1
make	1
haste	1
he	1
added	1
smiling	1
and	1
gathering	1
up	1
his	1
books	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
too	1
He	1
too	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
good	1
humored	1
and	1
disinclined	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
side	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
raining	1
Rain	1
Why	1
there	1
was	1
scarcely	1
a	1
drop	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
directly	1
So	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
nice	1
day	1
too	1
That	1
s	1
first	1
rate	1
And	1
Levin	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
clothes	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
brothers	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
Although	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
hungry	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
simply	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
hurt	1
Kouzma	1
s	1
feelings	1
yet	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
dinner	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
extraordinarily	1
good	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Oh	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
Kouzma	1
bring	1
it	1
down	1
please	1
And	1
mind	1
you	1
shut	1
the	1
doors	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
from	1
Oblonsky	1
Levin	1
read	1
it	1
aloud	1
Oblonsky	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Dolly	1
she	1
s	1
at	1
Ergushovo	1
and	1
everything	1
seems	1
going	1
wrong	1
there	1
Do	1
ride	1
over	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
please	1
help	1
her	1
with	1
advice	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
She	1
s	1
quite	1
alone	1
poor	1
thing	1
My	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
still	1
abroad	1
That	1
s	1
capital	1
I	1
will	1
certainly	1
ride	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
said	1
Levin	1
Or	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
together	1
She	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
splendid	1
woman	1
isn	1
t	1
she	1
They	1
re	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
here	1
then	1
Twenty	1
five	1
miles	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
thirty	1
But	1
a	1
capital	1
road	1
Capital	1
we	1
ll	1
drive	1
over	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
still	1
smiling	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
s	1
appearance	1
had	1
immediately	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
humor	1
Well	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
appetite	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
dark	1
red	1
sunburnt	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
plate	1
Splendid	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
what	1
an	1
effectual	1
remedy	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
foolishness	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
enrich	1
medicine	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
word	1
Arbeitskur	1
Well	1
but	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
need	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
fancy	1
No	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
nervous	1
invalids	1
Yes	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
I	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
mowing	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
unbearably	1
hot	1
that	1
I	1
got	1
no	1
further	1
than	1
the	1
forest	1
I	1
sat	1
there	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
forest	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
met	1
your	1
old	1
nurse	1
and	1
sounded	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
view	1
of	1
you	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
approve	1
of	1
this	1
She	1
said	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
gentleman	1
s	1
work	1
Altogether	1
I	1
fancy	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
s	1
ideas	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
clear	1
and	1
definite	1
notions	1
of	1
certain	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
it	1
gentlemanly	1
lines	1
of	1
action	1
And	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
sanction	1
the	1
gentry	1
s	1
moving	1
outside	1
bounds	1
clearly	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
ideas	1
Maybe	1
so	1
but	1
anyway	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pleasure	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
known	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
Is	1
there	1
answered	1
Levin	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
if	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
it	1
Though	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
Eh	1
Altogether	1
pursued	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
you	1
re	1
satisfied	1
with	1
your	1
day	1
Quite	1
satisfied	1
We	1
cut	1
the	1
whole	1
meadow	1
And	1
such	1
a	1
splendid	1
old	1
man	1
I	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
there	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
fancy	1
how	1
delightful	1
he	1
was	1
Well	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
content	1
with	1
your	1
day	1
And	1
so	1
am	1
I	1
First	1
I	1
solved	1
two	1
chess	1
problems	1
and	1
one	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
one	1
a	1
pawn	1
opening	1
I	1
ll	1
show	1
it	1
you	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
thought	1
over	1
our	1
conversation	1
yesterday	1
Eh	1
our	1
conversation	1
yesterday	1
said	1
Levin	1
blissfully	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyelids	1
and	1
drawing	1
deep	1
breaths	1
after	1
finishing	1
his	1
dinner	1
and	1
absolutely	1
incapable	1
of	1
recalling	1
what	1
their	1
conversation	1
yesterday	1
was	1
about	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
partly	1
right	1
Our	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
amounts	1
to	1
this	1
that	1
you	1
make	1
the	1
mainspring	1
self	1
interest	1
while	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
weal	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
exist	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
advancement	1
Possibly	1
you	1
are	1
right	1
too	1
that	1
action	1
founded	1
on	1
material	1
interest	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
desirable	1
You	1
are	1
altogether	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
say	1
too	1
primesauti`ere	1
a	1
nature	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
intense	1
energetic	1
action	1
or	1
nothing	1
Levin	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
understand	1
He	1
was	1
only	1
afraid	1
his	1
brother	1
might	1
ask	1
him	1
some	1
question	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
evident	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
So	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
touching	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
Yes	1
of	1
course	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
my	1
view	1
answered	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
childlike	1
smile	1
Whatever	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
was	1
disputing	1
about	1
he	1
wondered	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
m	1
right	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
right	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
first	1
rate	1
Only	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
and	1
see	1
to	1
things	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
stretching	1
and	1
smiling	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiled	1
too	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
together	1
he	1
said	1
disinclined	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
seemed	1
positively	1
breathing	1
out	1
freshness	1
and	1
energy	1
Come	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
Oh	1
heavens	1
shouted	1
Levin	1
so	1
loudly	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
quite	1
frightened	1
What	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
How	1
s	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
hand	1
said	1
Levin	1
slapping	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
I	1
d	1
positively	1
forgotten	1
her	1
even	1
It	1
s	1
much	1
better	1
Well	1
anyway	1
I	1
ll	1
run	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
Before	1
you	1
ve	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
your	1
hat	1
on	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
back	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
clattering	1
with	1
his	1
heels	1
like	1
a	1
spring	1
rattle	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Stephan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
and	1
essential	1
official	1
duty	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
service	1
though	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
outsiders	1
that	1
duty	1
but	1
for	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
in	1
government	1
service	1
of	1
reminding	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
having	1
for	1
the	1
due	1
performance	1
of	1
this	1
rite	1
taken	1
all	1
the	1
available	1
cash	1
from	1
home	1
was	1
gaily	1
and	1
agreeably	1
spending	1
his	1
days	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
villas	1
Meanwhile	1
Dolly	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
expenses	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
She	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Ergushovo	1
the	1
estate	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
dowry	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
where	1
in	1
spring	1
the	1
forest	1
had	1
been	1
sold	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
forty	1
miles	1
from	1
Levin	1
s	1
Pokrovskoe	1
The	1
big	1
old	1
house	1
at	1
Ergushovo	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
down	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
lodge	1
done	1
up	1
and	1
built	1
on	1
to	1
Twenty	1
years	1
before	1
when	1
Dolly	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
the	1
lodge	1
had	1
been	1
roomy	1
and	1
comfortable	1
though	1
like	1
all	1
lodges	1
it	1
stood	1
sideways	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
avenue	1
and	1
faced	1
the	1
south	1
But	1
by	1
now	1
this	1
lodge	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
dilapidated	1
When	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
forest	1
Dolly	1
had	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
order	1
what	1
repairs	1
might	1
be	1
needed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
like	1
all	1
unfaithful	1
husbands	1
indeed	1
was	1
very	1
solicitous	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
comfort	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
looked	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
given	1
instructions	1
about	1
everything	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
necessary	1
What	1
he	1
considered	1
necessary	1
was	1
to	1
cover	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
with	1
cretonne	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
curtains	1
to	1
weed	1
the	1
garden	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
bridge	1
on	1
the	1
pond	1
and	1
to	1
plant	1
flowers	1
But	1
he	1
forgot	1
many	1
other	1
essential	1
matters	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
which	1
greatly	1
distressed	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
later	1
on	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
efforts	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
attentive	1
father	1
and	1
husband	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
keep	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
He	1
had	1
bachelor	1
tastes	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
shaped	1
his	1
life	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Moscow	1
he	1
informed	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
pride	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
ready	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
paradise	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
advised	1
her	1
most	1
certainly	1
to	1
go	1
His	1
wife	1
s	1
staying	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
very	1
agreeable	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
it	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
good	1
it	1
decreased	1
expenses	1
and	1
it	1
left	1
him	1
more	1
at	1
liberty	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
regarded	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
as	1
essential	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
especially	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
regaining	1
her	1
strength	1
after	1
the	1
scarlatina	1
and	1
also	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
escaping	1
the	1
petty	1
humiliations	1
the	1
little	1
bills	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
wood	1
merchant	1
the	1
fishmonger	1
the	1
shoemaker	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
miserable	1
Besides	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
dreaming	1
of	1
getting	1
her	1
sister	1
Kitty	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
her	1
there	1
Kitty	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
and	1
bathing	1
had	1
been	1
prescribed	1
for	1
her	1
Kitty	1
wrote	1
that	1
no	1
prospect	1
was	1
so	1
alluring	1
as	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
Dolly	1
at	1
Ergushovo	1
full	1
of	1
childish	1
associations	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
The	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
were	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
Dolly	1
She	1
used	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
had	1
retained	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
a	1
refuge	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
that	1
life	1
there	1
though	1
not	1
luxurious	1
Dolly	1
could	1
easily	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
that	1
was	1
cheap	1
and	1
comfortable	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
plenty	1
of	1
everything	1
everything	1
was	1
cheap	1
everything	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
and	1
children	1
were	1
happy	1
But	1
now	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
fall	1
of	1
rain	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
water	1
came	1
through	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
beds	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
the	1
nine	1
cows	1
it	1
appeared	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
cowherd	1
woman	1
that	1
some	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
calve	1
others	1
had	1
just	1
calved	1
others	1
were	1
old	1
and	1
others	1
again	1
hard	1
uddered	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
butter	1
nor	1
milk	1
enough	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
eggs	1
They	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
fowls	1
old	1
purplish	1
stringy	1
cocks	1
were	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
roasting	1
and	1
boiling	1
Impossible	1
to	1
get	1
women	1
to	1
scrub	1
the	1
floors	1
all	1
were	1
potato	1
hoeing	1
Driving	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
because	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
was	1
restive	1
and	1
bolted	1
in	1
the	1
shafts	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
bathe	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
bank	1
was	1
trampled	1
by	1
the	1
cattle	1
and	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
even	1
walks	1
were	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
cattle	1
strayed	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
through	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
hedge	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
terrible	1
bull	1
who	1
bellowed	1
and	1
therefore	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
gore	1
somebody	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
proper	1
cupboards	1
for	1
their	1
clothes	1
what	1
cupboards	1
there	1
were	1
either	1
would	1
not	1
close	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
burst	1
open	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
passed	1
by	1
them	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
pots	1
and	1
pans	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
copper	1
in	1
the	1
washhouse	1
nor	1
even	1
an	1
ironing	1
board	1
in	1
the	1
maids	1
room	1
Finding	1
instead	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
rest	1
all	1
these	1
from	1
her	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
fearful	1
calamities	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
in	1
despair	1
She	1
exerted	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
felt	1
the	1
hopelessness	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
every	1
instant	1
suppressing	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
started	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
The	1
bailiff	1
a	1
retired	1
quartermaster	1
whom	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
and	1
had	1
appointed	1
bailiff	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
handsome	1
and	1
respectful	1
appearance	1
as	1
a	1
hall	1
porter	1
showed	1
no	1
sympathy	1
for	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
woes	1
He	1
said	1
respectfully	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
wretched	1
lot	1
and	1
did	1
nothing	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
The	1
position	1
seemed	1
hopeless	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
household	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
families	1
indeed	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
inconspicuous	1
but	1
most	1
valuable	1
and	1
useful	1
person	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
She	1
soothed	1
her	1
mistress	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
expression	1
and	1
Matvey	1
had	1
borrowed	1
it	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
without	1
fuss	1
or	1
hurry	1
proceeded	1
to	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
herself	1
She	1
had	1
immediately	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
day	1
she	1
drank	1
tea	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
bailiff	1
under	1
the	1
acacias	1
and	1
reviewed	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
Very	1
soon	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
had	1
established	1
her	1
club	1
so	1
to	1
say	1
under	1
the	1
acacias	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
club	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
wife	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
and	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
that	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
existence	1
were	1
gradually	1
smoothed	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
s	1
time	1
everything	1
actually	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
The	1
roof	1
was	1
mended	1
a	1
kitchen	1
maid	1
was	1
found	1
a	1
crony	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
s	1
hens	1
were	1
bought	1
the	1
cows	1

up	1
with	1
stakes	1
the	1
carpenter	1
made	1
a	1
mangle	1
hooks	1
were	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
cupboards	1
and	1
they	1
ceased	1
to	1
burst	1
open	1
spontaneously	1
and	1
an	1
ironing	1
board	1
covered	1
with	1
army	1
cloth	1
was	1
placed	1
across	1
from	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
to	1
the	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
flatirons	1
in	1
the	1
maids	1
room	1
Just	1
see	1
now	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
quite	1
in	1
despair	1
said	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
ironing	1
board	1
They	1
even	1
rigged	1
up	1
a	1
bathing	1
shed	1
of	1
straw	1
hurdles	1
Lily	1
began	1
to	1
bathe	1
and	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
began	1
to	1
realize	1
if	1
only	1
in	1
part	1
her	1
expectations	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
peaceful	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
a	1
comfortable	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Peaceful	1
with	1
six	1
children	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
One	1
would	1
fall	1
ill	1
another	1
might	1
easily	1
become	1
so	1
a	1
third	1
would	1
be	1
without	1
something	1
necessary	1
a	1
fourth	1
would	1
show	1
symptoms	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
disposition	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
Rare	1
indeed	1
were	1
the	1
brief	1
periods	1
of	1
peace	1
But	1
these	1
cares	1
and	1
anxieties	1
were	1
for	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
the	1
sole	1
happiness	1
possible	1
Had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
them	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
left	1
alone	1
to	1
brood	1
over	1
her	1
husband	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
And	1
besides	1
hard	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
illness	1
the	1
illnesses	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
seeing	1
signs	1
of	1
evil	1
propensities	1
in	1
her	1
children	1
the	1
children	1
themselves	1
were	1
even	1
now	1
repaying	1
her	1
in	1
small	1
joys	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
Those	1
joys	1
were	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
they	1
passed	1
unnoticed	1
like	1
gold	1
in	1
sand	1
and	1
at	1
bad	1
moments	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
pain	1
nothing	1
but	1
sand	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
good	1
moments	1
too	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
joy	1
nothing	1
but	1
gold	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
aware	1
of	1
those	1
joys	1
Often	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
every	1
possible	1
effort	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
mistaken	1
that	1
she	1
as	1
a	1
mother	1
was	1
partial	1
to	1
her	1
children	1
All	1
the	1
same	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
charming	1
children	1
all	1
six	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
different	1
ways	1
but	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
children	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
proud	1
of	1
them	1
Chapter	1

Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
May	1
when	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
satisfactorily	1
arranged	1
she	1
received	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
complaints	1
of	1
the	1
disorganized	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
He	1
wrote	1
begging	1
her	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
thought	1
of	1
everything	1
before	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
chance	1
This	1
chance	1
did	1
not	1
present	1
itself	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
June	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
stayed	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
On	1
the	1
Sunday	1
in	1
St	1
Peter	1
s	1
week	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
drove	1
to	1
mass	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
children	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
sacrament	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
in	1
her	1
intimate	1
philosophical	1
talks	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
friends	1
very	1
often	1
astonished	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
her	1
views	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
religion	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
strange	1
religion	1
of	1
transmigration	1
of	1
souls	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
firm	1
faith	1
troubling	1
herself	1
little	1
about	1
the	1
dogmas	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
But	1
in	1
her	1
family	1
she	1
was	1
strict	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
set	1
an	1
example	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
it	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
sacrament	1
for	1
nearly	1
a	1
year	1
worried	1
her	1
extremely	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
approval	1
and	1
sympathy	1
of	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
she	1
decided	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
For	1
several	1
days	1
before	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
busily	1
deliberating	1
on	1
how	1
to	1
dress	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
Frocks	1
were	1
made	1
or	1
altered	1
and	1
washed	1
seams	1
and	1
flounces	1
were	1
let	1
out	1
buttons	1
were	1
sewn	1
on	1
and	1
ribbons	1
got	1
ready	1
One	1
dress	1
Tanya	1
s	1
which	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
had	1
undertaken	1
cost	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
much	1
loss	1
of	1
temper	1
The	1
English	1
governess	1
in	1
altering	1
it	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
seams	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
place	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
sleeves	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
altogether	1
spoilt	1
the	1
dress	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
narrow	1
on	1
Tanya	1
s	1
shoulders	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
painful	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
But	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
had	1
the	1
happy	1
thought	1
of	1
putting	1
in	1
gussets	1
and	1
adding	1
a	1
little	1
shoulder	1
cape	1
The	1
dress	1
was	1
set	1
right	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nearly	1
a	1
quarrel	1
with	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
however	1
all	1
was	1
happily	1
arranged	1
and	1
towards	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
priest	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
mass	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
their	1
new	1
dresses	1
with	1
beaming	1
faces	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
before	1
the	1
carriage	1
waiting	1
for	1
their	1
mother	1
To	1
the	1
carriage	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
restive	1
Raven	1
they	1
had	1
harnessed	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
representations	1
of	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
horse	1
Brownie	1
and	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
delayed	1
by	1
anxiety	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
attire	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
got	1
in	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
muslin	1
gown	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
dressed	1
with	1
care	1
and	1
excitement	1
In	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
she	1
had	1
dressed	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake	1
to	1
look	1
pretty	1
and	1
be	1
admired	1
Later	1
on	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
older	1
dress	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
distasteful	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
losing	1
her	1
good	1
looks	1
But	1
now	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
pleasure	1
and	1
interest	1
in	1
dress	1
again	1
Now	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
dress	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
beauty	1
but	1
simply	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
those	1
exquisite	1
creatures	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
spoil	1
the	1
general	1
effect	1
And	1
looking	1
at	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
herself	1
She	1
looked	1
nice	1
Not	1
nice	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
wished	1
to	1
look	1
nice	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
but	1
nice	1
for	1
the	1
object	1
which	1
she	1
now	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
In	1
the	1
church	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
their	1
women	1
folk	1
But	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
saw	1
or	1
fancied	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
sensation	1
produced	1
by	1
her	1
children	1
and	1
her	1
The	1
children	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
beautiful	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
their	1
smart	1
little	1
dresses	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
charming	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
behaved	1
Aliosha	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
did	1
not	1
stand	1
quite	1
correctly	1
he	1
kept	1
turning	1
round	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
little	1
jacket	1
from	1
behind	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
sweet	1
Tanya	1
behaved	1
like	1
a	1
grown	1
up	1
person	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
And	1
the	1
smallest	1
Lily	1
was	1
bewitching	1
in	1
her	1
na"ive	1
astonishment	1
at	1
everything	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
not	1
to	1
smile	1
when	1
after	1
taking	1
the	1
sacrament	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
English	1
Please	1
some	1
more	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
the	1
children	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
solemn	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
were	1
very	1
sedate	1
Everything	1
went	1
happily	1
at	1
home	1
too	1
but	1
at	1
lunch	1
Grisha	1
began	1
whistling	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
worse	1
was	1
disobedient	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
and	1
was	1
forbidden	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
tart	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
let	1
things	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
day	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
present	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
s	1
authority	1
and	1
she	1
upheld	1
her	1
decision	1
that	1
Grisha	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
tart	1
This	1
rather	1
spoiled	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
humor	1
Grisha	1
cried	1
declaring	1
that	1
Nikolinka	1
had	1
whistled	1
too	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
punished	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
wasn	1
t	1
crying	1
for	1
the	1
tart	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
but	1
at	1
being	1
unjustly	1
treated	1
This	1
was	1
really	1
too	1
tragic	1
and	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
to	1
forgive	1
Grisha	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
beheld	1
a	1
scene	1
filling	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
such	1
pleasure	1
that	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
forgave	1
the	1
delinquent	1
herself	1
The	1
culprit	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
beside	1
him	1
was	1
standing	1
Tanya	1
with	1
a	1
plate	1
On	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
wanting	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
dinner	1
to	1
her	1
dolls	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
governess	1
s	1
permission	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
share	1
of	1
tart	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
instead	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
While	1
still	1
weeping	1
over	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
punishment	1
he	1
was	1
eating	1
the	1
tart	1
and	1
kept	1
saying	1
through	1
his	1
sobs	1
Eat	1
yourself	1
let	1
s	1
eat	1
it	1
together	1
together	1
Tanya	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
pity	1
for	1
Grisha	1
then	1
of	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
noble	1
action	1
and	1
tears	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
too	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
refuse	1
and	1
ate	1
her	1
share	1
On	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
they	1
were	1
dismayed	1
but	1
looking	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
they	1
saw	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
doing	1
wrong	1
They	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
mouths	1
full	1
of	1
tart	1
they	1
began	1
wiping	1
their	1
smiling	1
lips	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
smearing	1
their	1
radiant	1
faces	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
jam	1
Mercy	1
Your	1
new	1
white	1
frock	1
Tanya	1
Grisha	1
said	1
their	1
mother	1
trying	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
frock	1
but	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
smiling	1
a	1
blissful	1
rapturous	1
smile	1
The	1
new	1
frocks	1
were	1
taken	1
off	1
and	1
orders	1
were	1
given	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
girls	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
blouses	1
put	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
boys	1
their	1
old	1
jackets	1
and	1
the	1
wagonette	1
to	1
be	1
harnessed	1
with	1
Brownie	1
to	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
annoyance	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
shafts	1
to	1
drive	1
out	1
for	1
mushroom	1
picking	1
and	1
bathing	1
A	1
roar	1
of	1
delighted	1
shrieks	1
arose	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
never	1
ceased	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
bathing	1
place	1
They	1
gathered	1
a	1
whole	1
basketful	1
of	1
mushrooms	1
even	1
Lily	1
found	1
a	1
birch	1
mushroom	1
It	1
had	1
always	1
happened	1
before	1
that	1
Miss	1
Hoole	1
found	1
them	1
and	1
pointed	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
found	1
a	1
big	1
one	1
quite	1
of	1
herself	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
scream	1
of	1
delight	1
Lily	1
has	1
found	1
a	1
mushroom	1
Then	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
river	1
put	1
the	1
horses	1
under	1
the	1
birch	1
trees	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bathing	1
place	1
The	1
coachman	1
Terenty	1
fastened	1
the	1
horses	1
who	1
kept	1
whisking	1
away	1
the	1
flies	1
to	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
treading	1
down	1
the	1
grass	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
and	1
smoked	1
his	1
shag	1
while	1
the	1
never	1
ceasing	1
shrieks	1
of	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
floated	1
across	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
bathing	1
place	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
restrain	1
their	1
wild	1
pranks	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
too	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
not	1
mix	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
stockings	1
little	1
breeches	1
and	1
shoes	1
for	1
the	1
different	1
legs	1
and	1
to	1
undo	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
up	1
again	1
all	1
the	1
tapes	1
and	1
buttons	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
liked	1
bathing	1
herself	1
and	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
enjoyed	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
bathing	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
To	1
go	1
over	1
all	1
those	1
fat	1
little	1
legs	1
pulling	1
on	1
their	1
stockings	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
dip	1
those	1
little	1
naked	1
bodies	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
their	1
screams	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
alarm	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
breathless	1
faces	1
with	1
wide	1
open	1
scared	1
and	1
happy	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
splashing	1
cherubs	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
When	1
half	1
the	1
children	1
had	1
been	1
dressed	1
some	1
peasant	1
women	1
in	1
holiday	1
dress	1
out	1
picking	1
herbs	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bathing	1
shed	1
and	1
stopped	1
shyly	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
handed	1
her	1
a	1
sheet	1
and	1
a	1
shirt	1
that	1
had	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
dry	1
them	1
and	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
At	1
first	1
they	1
laughed	1
behind	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
questions	1
but	1
soon	1
they	1
grew	1
bolder	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
winning	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
heart	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
genuine	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
they	1
showed	1
My	1
what	1
a	1
beauty	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
sugar	1
said	1
one	1
admiring	1
Tanitchka	1
and	1
shaking	1
her	1
head	1
but	1
thin	1
Yes	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
ill	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
ve	1
been	1
bathing	1
you	1
too	1
said	1
another	1
to	1
the	1
baby	1
No	1
he	1
s	1
only	1
three	1
months	1
old	1
answered	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
with	1
pride	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
And	1
have	1
you	1
any	1
children	1
I	1
ve	1
had	1
four	1
I	1
ve	1
two	1
living	1
a	1
boy	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
I	1
weaned	1
her	1
last	1
carnival	1
How	1
old	1
is	1
she	1
Why	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
nurse	1
her	1
so	1
long	1
It	1
s	1
our	1
custom	1
for	1
three	1
fasts	1
And	1
the	1
conversation	1
became	1
most	1
interesting	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
time	1
did	1
she	1
have	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
the	1
boy	1
Where	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
Did	1
it	1
often	1
happen	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
felt	1
disinclined	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
peasant	1
women	1
so	1
interesting	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
their	1
conversation	1
so	1
completely	1
identical	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
interests	1
What	1
pleased	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
clearly	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
admired	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
was	1
her	1
having	1
so	1
many	1
children	1
and	1
such	1
fine	1
ones	1
The	1
peasant	1
women	1
even	1
made	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
laugh	1
and	1
offended	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
laughter	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
women	1
kept	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
Englishwoman	1
who	1
was	1
dressing	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
third	1
petticoat	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
the	1
remark	1
My	1
she	1
keeps	1
putting	1
on	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
and	1
she	1
ll	1
never	1
have	1
done	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
roars	1
Chapter	1
9	1
On	1
the	1
drive	1
home	1
as	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
children	1
round	1
her	1
their	1
heads	1
still	1
wet	1
from	1
their	1
bath	1
and	1
a	1
kerchief	1
tied	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
head	1
was	1
getting	1
near	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
coachman	1
said	1
There	1
s	1
some	1
gentleman	1
coming	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
Pokrovskoe	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
peeped	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
when	1
she	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
gray	1
hat	1
and	1
gray	1
coat	1
the	1
familiar	1
figure	1
of	1
Levin	1
walking	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
She	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
specially	1
glad	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
glory	1
No	1
one	1
was	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
appreciate	1
her	1
grandeur	1
than	1
Levin	1
Seeing	1
her	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
his	1
daydream	1
of	1
family	1
life	1
You	1
re	1
like	1
a	1
hen	1
with	1
your	1
chickens	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Ah	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
Glad	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
My	1
brother	1
s	1
staying	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Stiva	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
here	1
From	1
Stiva	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
asked	1
with	1
surprise	1
Yes	1
he	1
writes	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
thinks	1
you	1
might	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
became	1
suddenly	1
embarrassed	1
and	1
stopping	1
abruptly	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
in	1
silence	1
by	1
the	1
wagonette	1
snapping	1
off	1
the	1
buds	1
of	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
and	1
nibbling	1
them	1
He	1
was	1
embarrassed	1
through	1
a	1
sense	1
that	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
would	1
be	1
annoyed	1
by	1
receiving	1
from	1
an	1
outsider	1
help	1
that	1
should	1
by	1
rights	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
husband	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
this	1
little	1
way	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
of	1
foisting	1
his	1
domestic	1
duties	1
on	1
others	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
aware	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
for	1
this	1
fineness	1
of	1
perception	1
for	1
this	1
delicacy	1
that	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
liked	1
Levin	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
said	1
Levin	1
that	1
that	1
simply	1
means	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
Though	1
I	1
can	1
fancy	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
town	1
housekeeping	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
in	1
the	1
wilds	1
here	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
anything	1
wanted	1
I	1
m	1
altogether	1
at	1
your	1
disposal	1
Oh	1
no	1
said	1
Dolly	1
At	1
first	1
things	1
were	1
rather	1
uncomfortable	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
ve	1
settled	1
everything	1
capitally	1
thanks	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
nurse	1
she	1
said	1
indicating	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
who	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
her	1
smiled	1
brightly	1
and	1
cordially	1
to	1
Levin	1
She	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
keen	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
matter	1
settled	1
Won	1
t	1
you	1
get	1
in	1
sir	1
we	1
ll	1
make	1
room	1
this	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
No	1
I	1
ll	1
walk	1
Children	1
who	1
d	1
like	1
to	1
race	1
the	1
horses	1
with	1
me	1
The	1
children	1
knew	1
Levin	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
but	1
they	1
experienced	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
him	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
shyness	1
and	1
hostility	1
which	1
children	1
so	1
often	1
experience	1
towards	1
hypocritical	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
often	1
and	1
miserably	1
punished	1
Hypocrisy	1
in	1
anything	1
whatever	1
may	1
deceive	1
the	1
cleverest	1
and	1
most	1
penetrating	1
man	1
but	1
the	1
least	1
wide	1
awake	1
of	1
children	1
recognizes	1
it	1
and	1
is	1
revolted	1
by	1
it	1
however	1
ingeniously	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
disguised	1
Whatever	1
faults	1
Levin	1
had	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
children	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
friendliness	1
that	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
face	1
On	1
his	1
invitation	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
ones	1
at	1
once	1
jumped	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
simply	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
their	1
nurse	1
or	1
Miss	1
Hoole	1
or	1
their	1
mother	1
Lily	1
too	1
began	1
begging	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
handed	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
sat	1
her	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
ran	1
along	1
with	1
her	1
Don	1
t	1
be	1
afraid	1
don	1
t	1
be	1

Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
good	1
humoredly	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
my	1
hurting	1
or	1
dropping	1
her	1
And	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
strong	1
agile	1
assiduously	1
careful	1
and	1
needlessly	1
wary	1
movements	1
the	1
mother	1
felt	1
her	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
and	1
smiled	1
gaily	1
and	1
approvingly	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
him	1
Here	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
children	1
and	1
with	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
sympathy	1
Levin	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
mood	1
not	1
infrequent	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
childlike	1
light	1
heartedness	1
that	1
she	1
particularly	1
liked	1
in	1
him	1
As	1
he	1
ran	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
gymnastic	1
feats	1
set	1
Miss	1
Hoole	1
laughing	1
with	1
his	1
queer	1
English	1
accent	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
After	1
dinner	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
sitting	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
balcony	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Kitty	1
You	1
know	1
Kitty	1
s	1
coming	1
here	1
and	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
me	1
Really	1
he	1
said	1
flushing	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
said	1
Then	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
you	1
two	1
cows	1
shall	1
I	1
If	1
you	1
insist	1
on	1
a	1
bill	1
you	1
shall	1
pay	1
me	1
five	1
roubles	1
a	1
month	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
too	1
bad	1
of	1
you	1
No	1
thank	1
you	1
We	1
can	1
manage	1
very	1
well	1
now	1
Oh	1
well	1
then	1
I	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
cows	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
ll	1
allow	1
me	1
I	1
ll	1
give	1
directions	1
about	1
their	1
food	1
Everything	1
depends	1
on	1
their	1
food	1
And	1
Levin	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
conversation	1
explained	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
cow	1
keeping	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
the	1
cow	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
machine	1
for	1
the	1
transformation	1
of	1
food	1
into	1
milk	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
He	1
talked	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
passionately	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
more	1
of	1
Kitty	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
hearing	1
it	1
He	1
dreaded	1
the	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
inward	1
peace	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
with	1
such	1
effort	1
Yes	1
but	1
still	1
all	1
this	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
after	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
it	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
responded	1
without	1
interest	1
She	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
got	1
her	1
household	1
matters	1
so	1
satisfactorily	1
arranged	1
thanks	1
to	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
disinclined	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
them	1
besides	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
knowledge	1
of	1
farming	1
General	1
principles	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
cow	1
being	1
a	1
machine	1
for	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
milk	1
she	1
looked	1
on	1
with	1
suspicion	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
such	1
principles	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
a	1
hindrance	1
in	1
farm	1
management	1
It	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
far	1
simpler	1
matter	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
needed	1
as	1
Marya	1
Philimonovna	1

That	1
was	1
clear	1
But	1
general	1
propositions	1
as	1
to	1
feeding	1
on	1
meal	1
and	1
on	1
grass	1
were	1
doubtful	1
and	1
obscure	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
important	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
Kitty	1
Chapter	1

Kitty	1
writes	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
she	1
longs	1
for	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
quiet	1
and	1
solitude	1
Dolly	1
said	1
after	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
had	1
followed	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
better	1
Levin	1
asked	1
in	1
agitation	1
Thank	1
God	1
she	1
s	1
quite	1
well	1
again	1
I	1
never	1
believed	1
her	1
lungs	1
were	1
affected	1
Oh	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
Dolly	1
fancied	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
touching	1
helpless	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
looked	1
silently	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
Let	1
me	1
ask	1
you	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
smiling	1
her	1
kindly	1
and	1
rather	1
mocking	1
smile	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
angry	1
with	1
Kitty	1
I	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
said	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
you	1
are	1
angry	1
Why	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
nor	1
them	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
blushing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
hair	1
I	1
wonder	1
really	1
that	1
with	1
your	1
kind	1
heart	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
this	1
How	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
feel	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
nothing	1
else	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
made	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
refused	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
tenderness	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
for	1
Kitty	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
for	1
the	1
slight	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
What	1
makes	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
know	1
Because	1
everybody	1
knows	1
it	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
guessed	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
Well	1
now	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
All	1
I	1
knew	1
was	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
dreadfully	1
miserable	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
begged	1
me	1
never	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
she	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
anyone	1
else	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
pass	1
between	1
you	1
Tell	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
When	1
was	1
it	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
their	1
house	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
I	1
am	1
awfully	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
You	1
suffer	1
only	1
from	1
pride	1
Perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
Levin	1
but	1
She	1
interrupted	1
him	1
But	1
she	1
poor	1
girl	1
I	1
am	1
awfully	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
Now	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
Well	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
Good	1
bye	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
till	1
we	1
meet	1
again	1
No	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
she	1
said	1
clutching	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
sit	1
down	1
Please	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
feeling	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
stir	1
within	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
hope	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
If	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
you	1
The	1
feeling	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
dead	1
revived	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
heart	1
Yes	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
now	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
for	1
you	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
free	1
and	1
make	1
your	1
own	1
choice	1
it	1
s	1
always	1
clear	1
whom	1
you	1
love	1
But	1
a	1
girl	1
s	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
suspense	1
with	1
all	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
or	1
maiden	1
s	1
modesty	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
sees	1
you	1
men	1
from	1
afar	1
who	1
takes	1
everything	1
on	1
trust	1
a	1
girl	1
may	1
have	1
and	1
often	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
Yes	1
if	1
the	1
heart	1
does	1
not	1
speak	1
No	1
the	1
heart	1
does	1
speak	1
but	1
just	1
consider	1
you	1
men	1
have	1
views	1
about	1
a	1
girl	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
you	1
make	1
friends	1
you	1
criticize	1
you	1
wait	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
found	1
what	1
you	1
love	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
sure	1
you	1
love	1
her	1
you	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
quite	1
it	1
Anyway	1
you	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
when	1
your	1
love	1
is	1
ripe	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
balance	1
has	1
completely	1
turned	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
you	1
are	1
choosing	1
from	1
But	1
a	1
girl	1
is	1
not	1
asked	1
She	1
is	1
expected	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
choice	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
cannot	1
choose	1
she	1
can	1
only	1
answer	1
yes	1
or	1
no	1
Yes	1
to	1
choose	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
thing	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
life	1
within	1
him	1
died	1
again	1
and	1
only	1
weighed	1
on	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
aching	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
s	1
how	1
one	1
chooses	1
a	1
new	1
dress	1
or	1
some	1
purchase	1
or	1
other	1
not	1
love	1
The	1
choice	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
And	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
repeating	1
it	1
Ah	1
pride	1
pride	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
as	1
though	1
despising	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
baseness	1
of	1
this	1
feeling	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
other	1
feeling	1
which	1
only	1
women	1
know	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
made	1
Kitty	1
an	1
offer	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
Doubt	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
Him	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
you	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Supposing	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
older	1
I	1
for	1
instance	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
could	1
have	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
I	1
always	1
disliked	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
Levin	1
recalled	1
Kitty	1
s	1
answer	1
She	1
had	1
said	1
No	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
dryly	1
I	1
appreciate	1
your	1
confidence	1
in	1
me	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
making	1
a	1
mistake	1
But	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
that	1
pride	1
you	1
so	1
despise	1
makes	1
any	1
thought	1
of	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
me	1
you	1
understand	1
utterly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
say	1
one	1
thing	1
more	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of	1
my	1
sister	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
own	1
children	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
she	1
cared	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
her	1
refusal	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
proves	1
nothing	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
said	1
Levin	1
jumping	1
up	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
hurting	1
me	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
yours	1
were	1
dead	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
this	1
and	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
lived	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
s	1
dead	1
dead	1
dead	1
How	1
absurd	1
you	1
are	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
looking	1
with	1
mournful	1
tenderness	1
at	1
Levin	1
s	1
excitement	1
Yes	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
musingly	1
So	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
then	1
when	1
Kitty	1
s	1
here	1
No	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
come	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
the	1
annoyance	1
of	1
my	1
presence	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
very	1
absurd	1
repeated	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
looking	1
with	1
tenderness	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
Very	1
well	1
then	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
this	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
for	1
Tanya	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
Where	1
s	1
my	1
spade	1
mamma	1
I	1
speak	1
French	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
too	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
in	1
French	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
French	1
for	1
spade	1
the	1
mother	1
prompted	1
her	1
and	1
then	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
French	1
where	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
spade	1
And	1
this	1
made	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
Levin	1
Everything	1
in	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
children	1
struck	1
him	1
now	1
as	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
charming	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
before	1
And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
talk	1
French	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
how	1
unnatural	1
and	1
false	1
it	1
is	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
feel	1
it	1
so	1
Learning	1
French	1
and	1
unlearning	1
sincerity	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
himself	1
unaware	1
that	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
thought	1
all	1
that	1
over	1
twenty	1
times	1
already	1
and	1
yet	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
some	1
loss	1
of	1
sincerity	1
believed	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
teach	1
her	1
children	1
French	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
Do	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
Levin	1
stayed	1
to	1
tea	1
but	1
his	1
good	1
humor	1
had	1
vanished	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
After	1
tea	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
order	1
his	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
he	1
found	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
greatly	1
disturbed	1
with	1
a	1
troubled	1
face	1
and	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
While	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
outside	1
an	1
incident	1
had	1
occurred	1
which	1
had	1
utterly	1
shattered	1
all	1
the	1
happiness	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
her	1
pride	1
in	1
her	1
children	1
Grisha	1
and	1
Tanya	1
had	1
been	1
fighting	1
over	1
a	1
ball	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
hearing	1
a	1
scream	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
ran	1
in	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
terrible	1
sight	1
Tanya	1
was	1
pulling	1
Grisha	1
s	1
hair	1
while	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
hideous	1
with	1
rage	1
was	1
beating	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
fists	1
wherever	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
at	1
her	1
Something	1
snapped	1
in	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
heart	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
this	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
darkness	1
had	1
swooped	1
down	1
upon	1
her	1
life	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
these	1
children	1
of	1
hers	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
proud	1
of	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
most	1
ordinary	1
but	1
positively	1
bad	1
ill	1
bred	1
children	1
with	1
coarse	1
brutal	1
propensities	1
wicked	1
children	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
else	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Levin	1
of	1
her	1
misery	1
Levin	1
saw	1
she	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
her	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
showed	1
nothing	1
bad	1
that	1
all	1
children	1
fight	1
but	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
artificial	1
and	1
talk	1
French	1
with	1
my	1
children	1
but	1
my	1
children	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
like	1
that	1
All	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
not	1
spoil	1
children	1
not	1
to	1
distort	1
their	1
nature	1
and	1
they	1
ll	1
be	1
delightful	1
No	1
my	1
children	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
like	1
that	1
He	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
drove	1
away	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1

of	1
July	1
the	1
elder	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
on	1
Levin	1
s	1
sister	1
s	1
estate	1
about	1
fifteen	1
miles	1
from	1
Pokrovskoe	1
came	1
to	1
Levin	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
how	1
things	1
were	1
going	1
there	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
hay	1
The	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
income	1
on	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
estate	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
riverside	1
meadows	1
In	1
former	1
years	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
bought	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
for	1
twenty	1
roubles	1
the	1
three	1
acres	1
When	1
Levin	1
took	1
over	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
he	1
thought	1
on	1
examining	1
the	1
grasslands	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
worth	1
more	1
and	1
he	1
fixed	1
the	1
price	1
at	1
twenty	1
five	1
roubles	1
the	1
three	1
acres	1
The	1
peasants	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
that	1
price	1
and	1
as	1
Levin	1
suspected	1
kept	1
off	1
other	1
purchasers	1
Then	1
Levin	1
had	1
driven	1
over	1
himself	1
and	1
arranged	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
grass	1
cut	1
partly	1
by	1
hired	1
labor	1
partly	1
at	1
a	1
payment	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
crop	1
His	1
own	1
peasants	1
put	1
every	1
hindrance	1
they	1
could	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
arrangement	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
the	1
meadows	1
had	1
yielded	1
a	1
profit	1
almost	1
double	1
The	1
previous	1
year	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
the	1
peasants	1
had	1
maintained	1
the	1
same	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
arrangement	1
and	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
This	1
year	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
doing	1
all	1
the	1
mowing	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
crop	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
had	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
and	1
that	1
fearing	1
rain	1
they	1
had	1
invited	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
over	1
had	1
divided	1
the	1
crop	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
had	1
raked	1
together	1
eleven	1
stacks	1
as	1
the	1
owner	1
s	1
share	1
From	1
the	1
vague	1
answers	1
to	1
his	1
question	1
how	1
much	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
on	1
the	1
principal	1
meadow	1
from	1
the	1
hurry	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
division	1
not	1
asking	1
leave	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
Levin	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
drive	1
over	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
Arriving	1
for	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
leaving	1
his	1
horse	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wet	1
nurse	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
bee	1
house	1
wanting	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
about	1
the	1
hay	1
Parmenitch	1
a	1
talkative	1
comely	1
old	1
man	1
gave	1
Levin	1
a	1
very	1
warm	1
welcome	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
about	1
his	1
bees	1
and	1
the	1
swarms	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
but	1
gave	1
vague	1
and	1
unwilling	1
answers	1
to	1
Levin	1
s	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
mowing	1
This	1
confirmed	1
Levin	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
his	1
suspicions	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
hay	1
fields	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
stacks	1
The	1
haystacks	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
contain	1
fifty	1
wagon	1
loads	1
each	1
and	1
to	1
convict	1
the	1
peasants	1
Levin	1
ordered	1
the	1
wagons	1
that	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
hay	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
directly	1
to	1
lift	1
one	1
stack	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
barn	1
There	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
thirty	1
two	1
loads	1
in	1
the	1
stack	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
elder	1
s	1
assertions	1
about	1
the	1
compressibility	1
of	1
hay	1
and	1
its	1
having	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
stacks	1
and	1
his	1
swearing	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
Levin	1
stuck	1
to	1
his	1
point	1
that	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
divided	1
without	1
his	1
orders	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
that	1
hay	1
as	1
fifty	1
loads	1
to	1
a	1
stack	1
After	1
a	1
prolonged	1
dispute	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
decided	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
taking	1
these	1
eleven	1
stacks	1
reckoning	1
them	1
as	1
fifty	1
loads	1
each	1
The	1
arguments	1
and	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
haycocks	1
lasted	1
the	1
whole	1
afternoon	1
When	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
had	1
been	1
divided	1
Levin	1
intrusting	1
the	1
superintendence	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
haycock	1
marked	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
stake	1
of	1
willow	1
and	1
looked	1
admiringly	1
at	1
the	1
meadow	1
swarming	1
with	1
peasants	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
beyond	1
the	1
marsh	1
moved	1
a	1
bright	1
colored	1
line	1
of	1
peasant	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
scattered	1
hay	1
was	1
being	1
rapidly	1
formed	1
into	1
gray	1
winding	1
rows	1
over	1
the	1
pale	1
green	1
stubble	1
After	1
the	1
women	1
came	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
pitchforks	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gray	1
rows	1
there	1
were	1
growing	1
up	1
broad	1
high	1
soft	1
haycocks	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
carts	1
were	1
rumbling	1
over	1
the	1
meadow	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
cleared	1
and	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
haycocks	1
vanished	1
flung	1
up	1
in	1
huge	1
forkfuls	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
place	1
there	1
were	1
rising	1
heavy	1
cartloads	1
of	1
fragrant	1
hay	1
hanging	1
over	1
the	1
horses	1
hind	1
quarters	1
What	1

What	1

an	1
old	1
man	1
squatting	1
down	1
beside	1
Levin	1
It	1

It	1

he	1
added	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
growing	1
haycocks	1
Since	1
dinner	1
time	1
they	1
ve	1
carried	1
a	1
good	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
The	1
last	1
load	1
eh	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
peasant	1
who	1
drove	1
by	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
an	1
empty	1
cart	1
shaking	1
the	1
cord	1
reins	1
The	1

the	1
lad	1
shouted	1
back	1
pulling	1
in	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
smiling	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
a	1
bright	1
rosy	1
checked	1
peasant	1
girl	1
who	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
smiling	1
too	1
and	1

Who	1

he	1
was	1

a	1

and	1
bashful	1

answered	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Well	1
the	1
hay	1
It	1
s	1
as	1
fragrant	1
as	1
tea	1
he	1
repeated	1
wishing	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
Levin	1
looked	1
more	1
attentively	1
at	1
Ivan	1
Parmenov	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
They	1
were	1
loading	1
a	1
haycock	1
onto	1
the	1
cart	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
him	1
Ivan	1
Parmenov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
cart	1
taking	1
laying	1
in	1
place	1
and	1
stamping	1
down	1
the	1
huge	1
bundles	1
of	1
hay	1
which	1
his	1
pretty	1
young	1
wife	1
deftly	1
handed	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
first	1
in	1
armfuls	1
and	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
pitchfork	1
The	1
young	1
wife	1
worked	1
easily	1
merrily	1
and	1
dexterously	1
The	1
close	1
packed	1
hay	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
break	1
away	1
off	1
her	1
fork	1
First	1
she	1
gathered	1
it	1
together	1
stuck	1
the	1
fork	1
into	1
it	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
supple	1
movement	1
leaned	1
the	1
whole	1
weight	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
bend	1
of	1
her	1
back	1
under	1
the	1
red	1
belt	1
she	1
drew	1
herself	1
up	1
and	1
arching	1
her	1
full	1
bosom	1
under	1
the	1
white	1
smock	1
with	1
a	1
smart	1
turn	1
swung	1
the	1
fork	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
flung	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
hay	1
high	1
onto	1
the	1
cart	1
Ivan	1
obviously	1
doing	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
every	1
minute	1
of	1
unnecessary	1
labor	1
made	1
haste	1
opening	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
clutch	1
the	1
bundle	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
As	1
she	1
raked	1
together	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
the	1
young	1
wife	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
bits	1
of	1
hay	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
straightening	1
the	1
red	1
kerchief	1
that	1
had	1
dropped	1
forward	1
over	1
her	1
white	1
brow	1
not	1
browned	1
like	1
her	1
face	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
she	1
crept	1
under	1
the	1
cart	1
to	1
tie	1
up	1
the	1
load	1
Ivan	1
directed	1
her	1
how	1
to	1
fasten	1
the	1
cord	1
to	1
the	1
cross	1
piece	1
and	1
at	1
something	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
In	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
both	1
faces	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
vigorous	1
young	1
freshly	1
awakened	1
love	1
Chapter	1

The	1
load	1
was	1
tied	1
on	1
Ivan	1
jumped	1
down	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
quiet	1
sleek	1
horse	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
The	1
young	1
wife	1
flung	1
the	1
rake	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
load	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bold	1
step	1
swinging	1
her	1
arms	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
women	1
who	1
were	1
forming	1
a	1
ring	1
for	1
the	1
haymakers	1
dance	1
Ivan	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
loaded	1
carts	1
The	1
peasant	1
women	1
with	1
their	1
rakes	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
gay	1
with	1
bright	1
flowers	1
and	1
chattering	1
with	1
ringing	1
merry	1
voices	1
walked	1
behind	1
the	1
hay	1
cart	1
One	1
wild	1
untrained	1
female	1
voice	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
song	1
and	1
sang	1
it	1
alone	1
through	1
a	1
verse	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
same	1
verse	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
and	1
repeated	1
by	1
half	1
a	1
hundred	1
strong	1
healthy	1
voices	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
coarse	1
and	1
fine	1
singing	1
in	1
unison	1
The	1
women	1
all	1
singing	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
storm	1
were	1
swooping	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
thunder	1
of	1
merriment	1
The	1
storm	1
swooped	1
down	1
enveloped	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
haycock	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
haycocks	1
and	1
the	1
wagon	1
loads	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
meadow	1
and	1
distant	1
fields	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
shaking	1
and	1
singing	1
to	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
this	1
wild	1
merry	1
song	1
with	1
its	1
shouts	1
and	1
whistles	1
and	1
clapping	1
Levin	1
felt	1
envious	1
of	1
this	1
health	1
and	1
mirthfulness	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
this	1
joy	1
of	1
life	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
look	1
on	1
and	1
listen	1
When	1
the	1
peasants	1
with	1
their	1
singing	1
had	1
vanished	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
hearing	1
a	1
weary	1
feeling	1
of	1
despondency	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
isolation	1
his	1
physical	1
inactivity	1
his	1
alienation	1
from	1
this	1
world	1
came	1
over	1
Levin	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
active	1
in	1
wrangling	1
with	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
hay	1
some	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
treated	1
with	1
contumely	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
cheat	1
him	1
those	1
very	1
peasants	1
had	1
greeted	1
him	1
good	1
humoredly	1
and	1
evidently	1
had	1
not	1
were	1
incapable	1
of	1
having	1
any	1
feeling	1
of	1
rancor	1
against	1
him	1
any	1
regret	1
any	1
recollection	1
even	1
of	1
having	1
tried	1
to	1
deceive	1
him	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
drowned	1
in	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
merry	1
common	1
labor	1
God	1
gave	1
the	1
day	1
God	1
gave	1
the	1
strength	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
were	1
consecrated	1
to	1
labor	1
and	1
that	1
labor	1
was	1
its	1
own	1
reward	1
For	1
whom	1
the	1
labor	1
What	1
would	1
be	1
its	1
fruits	1
These	1
were	1
idle	1
considerations	1
beside	1
the	1
point	1
Often	1
Levin	1
had	1
admired	1
this	1
life	1
often	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
led	1
this	1
life	1
but	1
today	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
especially	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
Ivan	1
Parmenov	1
to	1
his	1
young	1
wife	1
the	1
idea	1
presented	1
itself	1
definitely	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
exchange	1
the	1
dreary	1
artificial	1
idle	1
and	1
individualistic	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
leading	1
for	1
this	1
laborious	1
pure	1
and	1
socially	1
delightful	1
life	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
gone	1
home	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
all	1
separated	1
Those	1
who	1
lived	1
near	1
had	1
gone	1
home	1
while	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
far	1
were	1
gathered	1
into	1
a	1
group	1
for	1
supper	1
and	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
meadow	1
Levin	1
unobserved	1
by	1
the	1
peasants	1
still	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
haycock	1
and	1
still	1
looked	1
on	1
and	1
listened	1
and	1
mused	1
The	1
peasants	1
who	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
meadow	1
scarcely	1
slept	1
all	1
the	1
short	1
summer	1
night	1
At	1
first	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
merry	1
talk	1
and	1
laughing	1
all	1
together	1
over	1
the	1
supper	1
then	1
singing	1
again	1
and	1
laughter	1
All	1
the	1
long	1
day	1
of	1
toil	1
had	1
left	1
no	1
trace	1
in	1
them	1
but	1
lightness	1
of	1
heart	1
Before	1
the	1
early	1
dawn	1
all	1
was	1
hushed	1
Nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
but	1
the	1
night	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
frogs	1
that	1
never	1
ceased	1
in	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
snorting	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
that	1
rose	1
over	1
the	1
meadow	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
Rousing	1
himself	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
haycock	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
stars	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
over	1
Well	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
trying	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
himself	1
all	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
in	1
that	1
brief	1
night	1
All	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
fell	1
into	1
three	1
separate	1
trains	1
of	1
thought	1
One	1
was	1
the	1
renunciation	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
utterly	1
useless	1
education	1
This	1
renunciation	1
gave	1
him	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
was	1
easy	1
and	1
simple	1
Another	1
series	1
of	1
thoughts	1
and	1
mental	1
images	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
live	1
now	1
The	1
simplicity	1
the	1
purity	1
the	1
sanity	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
clearly	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
content	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
miserably	1
conscious	1
But	1
a	1
third	1
series	1
of	1
ideas	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
effect	1
this	1
transition	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
And	1
there	1
nothing	1
took	1
clear	1
shape	1
for	1
him	1
Have	1
a	1
wife	1
Have	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
work	1
Leave	1
Pokrovskoe	1
Buy	1
land	1
Become	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
a	1
peasant	1
community	1
Marry	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl	1
How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
again	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
slept	1
all	1
night	1
though	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
think	1
it	1
out	1
clearly	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
I	1
ll	1
work	1
it	1
out	1
later	1
One	1
thing	1
s	1
certain	1
this	1
night	1
has	1
decided	1
my	1
fate	1
All	1
my	1
old	1
dreams	1
of	1
home	1
life	1
were	1
absurd	1
not	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
simpler	1
and	1
better	1
How	1
beautiful	1
he	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
mother	1
of	1
pearl	1
shell	1
of	1
white	1
fleecy	1
cloudlets	1
resting	1
right	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
How	1
exquisite	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
exquisite	1
night	1
And	1
when	1
was	1
there	1
time	1
for	1
that	1
cloud	1
shell	1
to	1
form	1
Just	1
now	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
only	1
two	1
white	1
streaks	1
Yes	1
and	1
so	1
imperceptibly	1
too	1
my	1
views	1
of	1
life	1
changed	1
He	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
and	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
towards	1
the	1
village	1
A	1
slight	1
wind	1
arose	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
looked	1
gray	1
and	1
sullen	1
The	1
gloomy	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
that	1
usually	1
precedes	1
the	1
dawn	1
the	1
full	1
triumph	1
of	1
light	1
over	1
darkness	1
Shrinking	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
Levin	1
walked	1
rapidly	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
What	1
s	1
that	1
Someone	1
coming	1
he	1
thought	1
catching	1
the	1
tinkle	1
of	1
bells	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
Forty	1
paces	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
carriage	1
with	1
four	1
horses	1
harnessed	1
abreast	1
was	1
driving	1
towards	1
him	1
along	1
the	1
grassy	1
road	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
The	1
shaft	1
horses	1
were	1
tilted	1
against	1
the	1
shafts	1
by	1
the	1
ruts	1
but	1
the	1
dexterous	1
driver	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
held	1
the	1
shaft	1
over	1
the	1
ruts	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wheels	1
ran	1
on	1
the	1
smooth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
This	1
was	1
all	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
and	1
without	1
wondering	1
who	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
he	1
gazed	1
absently	1
at	1
the	1
coach	1
In	1
the	1
coach	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
dozing	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
evidently	1
only	1
just	1
awake	1
sat	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
holding	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
the	1
ribbons	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
cap	1
With	1
a	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
light	1
and	1
thought	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
subtle	1
complex	1
inner	1
life	1
that	1
was	1
remote	1
from	1
Levin	1
she	1
was	1
gazing	1
beyond	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
sunrise	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
this	1
apparition	1
was	1
vanishing	1
the	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
She	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
wondering	1
delight	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
other	1
eyes	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
could	1
concentrate	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
brightness	1
and	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
It	1
was	1
she	1
It	1
was	1
Kitty	1
He	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
driving	1
to	1
Ergushovo	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
And	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
stirring	1
Levin	1
during	1
that	1
sleepless	1
night	1
all	1
the	1
resolutions	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
all	1
vanished	1
at	1
once	1
He	1
recalled	1
with	1
horror	1
his	1
dreams	1
of	1
marrying	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl	1
There	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
had	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
was	1
rapidly	1
disappearing	1
there	1
only	1
could	1
he	1
find	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
riddle	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
weighed	1
so	1
agonizingly	1
upon	1
him	1
of	1
late	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
out	1
again	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
springs	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
audible	1
the	1
bells	1
could	1
scarcely	1
be	1
heard	1
The	1
barking	1
of	1
dogs	1
showed	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
was	1
the	1
empty	1
fields	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
isolated	1
and	1
apart	1
from	1
it	1
all	1
wandering	1
lonely	1
along	1
the	1
deserted	1
highroad	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
expecting	1
to	1
find	1
there	1
the	1
cloud	1
shell	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
admiring	1
and	1
taking	1
as	1
the	1
symbol	1
of	1
the	1
ideas	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
that	1
night	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
like	1
a	1
shell	1
There	1
in	1
the	1
remote	1
heights	1
above	1
a	1
mysterious	1
change	1
had	1
been	1
accomplished	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
shell	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
stretched	1
over	1
fully	1
half	1
the	1
sky	1
an	1
even	1
cover	1
of	1
tiny	1
and	1
ever	1
tinier	1
cloudlets	1
The	1
sky	1
had	1
grown	1
blue	1
and	1
bright	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
softness	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
remoteness	1
it	1
met	1
his	1
questioning	1
gaze	1
No	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
however	1
good	1
that	1
life	1
of	1
simplicity	1
and	1
toil	1
may	1
be	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
it	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
Chapter	1
13	1
None	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
most	1
intimate	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
knew	1
that	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
the	1
coldest	1
and	1
most	1
reasonable	1
of	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
weakness	1
quite	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
trend	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
or	1
see	1
a	1
child	1
or	1
woman	1
crying	1
without	1
being	1
moved	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
tears	1
threw	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
and	1
he	1
utterly	1
lost	1
all	1
power	1
of	1
reflection	1
The	1
chief	1
secretary	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
and	1
his	1
private	1
secretary	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
warn	1
women	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
petitions	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
tears	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
ruin	1
their	1
chances	1
He	1
will	1
get	1
angry	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
you	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
the	1
emotional	1
disturbance	1
set	1
up	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
tears	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
hasty	1
anger	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
Kindly	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
would	1
commonly	1
cry	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
When	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
Anna	1
had	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
had	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
fury	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
against	1
her	1
was	1
aware	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
that	1
emotional	1
disturbance	1
always	1
produced	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
tears	1
Conscious	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
conscious	1
that	1
any	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
feelings	1
at	1
that	1
minute	1
would	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
suppress	1
every	1
manifestation	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
so	1
neither	1
stirred	1
nor	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
This	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
caused	1
that	1
strange	1
expression	1
of	1
deathlike	1
rigidity	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
so	1
impressed	1
Anna	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
helped	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
master	1
himself	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
urbanity	1
and	1
uttered	1
that	1
phrase	1
that	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
nothing	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
his	1
decision	1
His	1
wife	1
s	1
words	1
confirming	1
his	1
worst	1
suspicions	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
cruel	1
pang	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
That	1
pang	1
was	1
intensified	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
physical	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
set	1
up	1
by	1
her	1
tears	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight	1
felt	1
complete	1
relief	1
both	1
from	1
this	1
pity	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
doubts	1
and	1
agonies	1
of	1
jealousy	1
He	1
experienced	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
tooth	1
out	1
after	1
suffering	1
long	1
from	1
toothache	1
After	1
a	1
fearful	1
agony	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
something	1
huge	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
head	1
itself	1
being	1
torn	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
jaw	1
the	1
sufferer	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
luck	1
feels	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
what	1
has	1
so	1
long	1
poisoned	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
enchained	1
his	1
attention	1
exists	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
live	1
and	1
think	1
again	1
and	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
besides	1
his	1
tooth	1
This	1
feeling	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
experiencing	1
The	1
agony	1
had	1
been	1
strange	1
and	1
terrible	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
live	1
again	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
other	1
than	1
his	1

No	1
honor	1
no	1

a	1
corrupt	1
woman	1
I	1
always	1
knew	1
it	1
and	1
always	1
saw	1
it	1
though	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
deceive	1
myself	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
And	1
it	1
actually	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
he	1
recalled	1
incidents	1
of	1
their	1
past	1
life	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
wrong	1
before	1
now	1
these	1
incidents	1
proved	1
clearly	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
corrupt	1
woman	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
linking	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
hers	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
mistake	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
but	1
she	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
me	1
Everything	1
relating	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
towards	1
whom	1
his	1
sentiments	1
were	1
as	1
much	1
changed	1
as	1
towards	1
her	1
ceased	1
to	1
interest	1
him	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
now	1
was	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
he	1
could	1
best	1
with	1
most	1
propriety	1
and	1
comfort	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
thus	1
with	1
most	1
justice	1
extricate	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
mud	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spattered	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
fall	1
and	1
then	1
proceed	1
along	1
his	1
path	1
of	1
active	1
honorable	1
and	1
useful	1
existence	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
unhappy	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
contemptible	1
woman	1
has	1
committed	1
a	1
crime	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
difficult	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
placed	1
me	1
And	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
frowning	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
I	1
m	1
not	1

nor	1

And	1

nothing	1

Admitting	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
quite	1
irrational	1
ridicule	1
falls	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
yet	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
misfortune	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
always	1
felt	1
sympathy	1
for	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
though	1
indeed	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
fact	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
sympathy	1
for	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
frequently	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
instances	1
of	1
unfaithful	1
wives	1
betraying	1
their	1
husbands	1
the	1
more	1
highly	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
himself	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
misfortune	1
which	1
may	1
befall	1
anyone	1
And	1
this	1
misfortune	1
has	1
befallen	1
me	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
passing	1
in	1
review	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
proceeding	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Daryalov	1
fought	1
a	1
duel	1
The	1
duel	1
had	1
particularly	1
fascinated	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
in	1
his	1
youth	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
physically	1
a	1
coward	1
and	1
was	1
himself	1
well	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
could	1
not	1
without	1
horror	1
contemplate	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
pistol	1
aimed	1
at	1
himself	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
any	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
This	1
horror	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
youth	1
set	1
him	1
pondering	1
on	1
dueling	1
and	1
picturing	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
expose	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
danger	1
Having	1
attained	1
success	1
and	1
an	1
established	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
forgotten	1
this	1
feeling	1
but	1
the	1
habitual	1
bent	1
of	1
feeling	1
reasserted	1
itself	1
and	1
dread	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cowardice	1
proved	1
even	1
now	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
spent	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
dueling	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
aspects	1
and	1
hugging	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
duel	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
fully	1
aware	1
beforehand	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
fight	1
one	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
doubt	1
our	1
society	1
is	1
still	1
so	1
barbarous	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
England	1
that	1
very	1
many	1
and	1
among	1
these	1
were	1
those	1
whose	1
opinion	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
particularly	1
valued	1
look	1
favorably	1
on	1
the	1
duel	1
but	1
what	1
result	1
is	1
attained	1
by	1
it	1
Suppose	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
out	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
vividly	1
picturing	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
after	1
the	1
challenge	1
and	1
the	1
pistol	1
aimed	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
shuddered	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
would	1
do	1
it	1
suppose	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
out	1
Suppose	1
I	1
am	1
taught	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
musing	1
to	1
shoot	1
I	1
press	1
the	1
trigger	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
dispel	1
such	1
silly	1
ideas	1
What	1
sense	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
murdering	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
define	1
one	1
s	1
relation	1
to	1
a	1
guilty	1
wife	1
and	1
son	1
I	1
should	1
still	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
have	1
to	1
decide	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
probable	1
and	1
what	1
would	1
doubtless	1
occur	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded	1
I	1
the	1
innocent	1
person	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
victim	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded	1
It	1
s	1
even	1
more	1
senseless	1
But	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1
fight	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
act	1
hardly	1
honest	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
Don	1
t	1
I	1
know	1
perfectly	1
well	1
that	1
my	1
friends	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
fight	1
a	1
duel	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
statesman	1
needed	1
by	1
Russia	1
to	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
danger	1
Knowing	1
perfectly	1
well	1
beforehand	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
to	1
real	1
danger	1
it	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
my	1
simply	1
trying	1
to	1
gain	1
a	1
certain	1
sham	1
reputation	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
challenge	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
dishonest	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
false	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
deceiving	1
myself	1
and	1
others	1
A	1
duel	1
is	1
quite	1
irrational	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
expects	1
it	1
of	1
me	1
My	1
aim	1
is	1
simply	1
to	1
safeguard	1
my	1
reputation	1
which	1
is	1
essential	1
for	1
the	1
uninterrupted	1
pursuit	1
of	1
my	1
public	1
duties	1
Official	1
duties	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
of	1
great	1
consequence	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
of	1
special	1
importance	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
Considering	1
and	1
rejecting	1
the	1
duel	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
turned	1
to	1
divorce	1
another	1
solution	1
selected	1
by	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
husbands	1
he	1
remembered	1
Passing	1
in	1
mental	1
review	1
all	1
the	1
instances	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
divorces	1
there	1
were	1
plenty	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
society	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
familiar	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
single	1
example	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
divorce	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
instances	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
practically	1
ceded	1
or	1
sold	1
his	1
unfaithful	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
party	1
which	1
being	1
in	1
fault	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
contract	1
a	1
fresh	1
marriage	1
had	1
formed	1
counterfeit	1
pseudo	1
matrimonial	1
ties	1
with	1
a	1
self	1
styled	1
husband	1
In	1
his	1
own	1
case	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
legal	1
divorce	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
one	1
in	1
which	1
only	1
the	1
guilty	1
wife	1
would	1
be	1
repudiated	1
was	1
impossible	1
of	1
attainment	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
complex	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
they	1
led	1
made	1
the	1
coarse	1
proofs	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
guilt	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
refinement	1
in	1
that	1
life	1
would	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
such	1
proofs	1
being	1
brought	1
forward	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
bring	1
forward	1
such	1
proofs	1
would	1
damage	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
estimation	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
would	1
her	1
An	1
attempt	1
at	1
divorce	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
public	1
scandal	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
perfect	1
godsend	1
to	1
his	1
enemies	1
for	1
calumny	1
and	1
attacks	1
on	1
his	1
high	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
His	1
chief	1
object	1
to	1
define	1
the	1
position	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
amount	1
of	1
disturbance	1
possible	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
attained	1
by	1
divorce	1
either	1
Moreover	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
divorce	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
divorce	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
wife	1
broke	1
off	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
threw	1
in	1
her	1
lot	1
with	1
the	1
lover	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
as	1
he	1
supposed	1
contempt	1
and	1
indifference	1
he	1
now	1
felt	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
still	1
had	1
one	1
feeling	1
left	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
disinclination	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
free	1
to	1
throw	1
in	1
her	1
lot	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
crime	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
her	1
advantage	1
The	1
mere	1
notion	1
of	1
this	1
so	1
exasperated	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
that	1
directly	1
it	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
groaned	1
with	1
inward	1
agony	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
after	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
scowling	1
brows	1
wrapping	1
his	1
numbed	1
and	1
bony	1
legs	1
in	1
the	1
fleecy	1
rug	1
Apart	1
from	1
formal	1
divorce	1
One	1
might	1
still	1
do	1
like	1
Karibanov	1
Paskudin	1
and	1
that	1
good	1
fellow	1
Dram	1
that	1
is	1
separate	1
from	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
thinking	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
regained	1
his	1
composure	1
But	1
this	1
step	1
too	1
presented	1
the	1
same	1
drawback	1
of	1
public	1
scandal	1
as	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
a	1
separation	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
regular	1
divorce	1
flung	1
his	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
twisting	1
his	1
rug	1
about	1
him	1
again	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
but	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
jealousy	1
which	1
had	1
tortured	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
the	1
tooth	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
agony	1
extracted	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
words	1
But	1
that	1
feeling	1
had	1
been	1
replaced	1
by	1
another	1
the	1
desire	1
not	1
merely	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
triumphant	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
get	1
due	1
punishment	1
for	1
her	1
crime	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
acknowledge	1
this	1
feeling	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
having	1
destroyed	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
his	1
honor	1
And	1
going	1
once	1
again	1
over	1
the	1
conditions	1
inseparable	1
from	1
a	1
duel	1
a	1
divorce	1
a	1
separation	1
and	1
once	1
again	1
rejecting	1
them	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
felt	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
solution	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
with	1
him	1
concealing	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
using	1
every	1
measure	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
the	1
intrigue	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
though	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
punish	1
her	1
I	1
must	1
inform	1
her	1
of	1
my	1
conclusion	1
that	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
terrible	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
placed	1
her	1
family	1
all	1
other	1
solutions	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
for	1
both	1
sides	1
than	1
an	1
external	1
status	1
quo	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
I	1
agree	1
to	1
retain	1
on	1
the	1
strict	1
condition	1
of	1
obedience	1
on	1
her	1
part	1
to	1
my	1
wishes	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
cessation	1
of	1
all	1
intercourse	1
with	1
her	1
lover	1
When	1
this	1
decision	1
had	1
been	1
finally	1
adopted	1
another	1
weighty	1
consideration	1
occurred	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
it	1
By	1
such	1
a	1
course	1
only	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
acting	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
religion	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
In	1
adopting	1
this	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
casting	1
off	1
a	1
guilty	1
wife	1
but	1
giving	1
her	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
amendment	1
and	1
indeed	1
difficult	1
as	1
the	1
task	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
devote	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
energies	1
to	1
her	1
reformation	1
and	1
salvation	1
Though	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
perfectly	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
exert	1
any	1
moral	1
influence	1
over	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
attempt	1
at	1
reformation	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
falsity	1
though	1
in	1
passing	1
through	1
these	1
difficult	1
moments	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
seeking	1
guidance	1
in	1
religion	1
yet	1
now	1
when	1
his	1
conclusion	1
corresponded	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
requirements	1
of	1
religion	1
this	1
religious	1
sanction	1
to	1
his	1
decision	1
gave	1
him	1
complete	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
restored	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
He	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
important	1
crisis	1
in	1
life	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
acted	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
that	1
religion	1
whose	1
banner	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
held	1
aloft	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
coolness	1
and	1
indifference	1
As	1
he	1
pondered	1
over	1
subsequent	1
developments	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
indeed	1
why	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
practically	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
before	1
No	1
doubt	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
regain	1
his	1
esteem	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
reason	1
that	1
his	1
existence	1
should	1
be	1
troubled	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
suffer	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
and	1
faithless	1
wife	1
Yes	1
time	1
will	1
pass	1
time	1
which	1
arranges	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
relations	1
will	1
be	1
reestablished	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
told	1
himself	1
so	1
far	1
reestablished	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
a	1
break	1
in	1
the	1
continuity	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
She	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
Chapter	1

As	1
he	1
neared	1
Petersburg	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
not	1
only	1
adhered	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
decision	1
but	1
was	1
even	1
composing	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
would	1
write	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
Going	1
into	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
papers	1
brought	1
from	1
his	1
office	1
and	1
directed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
The	1
horses	1
can	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
pleasure	1
indicative	1
of	1
his	1
agreeable	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
emphasizing	1
the	1
words	1
see	1
no	1
one	1
In	1
his	1
study	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
twice	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
an	1
immense	1
writing	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
six	1
candles	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
lighted	1
by	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
had	1
preceded	1
him	1
He	1
cracked	1
his	1
knuckles	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
sorting	1
out	1
his	1
writing	1
appurtenances	1
Putting	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
thought	1
a	1
minute	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
without	1
pausing	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
He	1
wrote	1
without	1
using	1
any	1
form	1
of	1
address	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
wrote	1
in	1
French	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
plural	1
vous	1
which	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
note	1
of	1
coldness	1
as	1
the	1
corresponding	1
Russian	1
form	1
At	1
our	1
last	1
conversation	1
I	1
notified	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
decision	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
that	1
conversation	1
Having	1
carefully	1
considered	1
everything	1
I	1
am	1
writing	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
fulfilling	1
that	1
promise	1
My	1
decision	1
is	1
as	1
follows	1
Whatever	1
your	1
conduct	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
consider	1
myself	1
justified	1
in	1
breaking	1
the	1
ties	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
by	1
a	1
Higher	1
Power	1
The	1
family	1
cannot	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
whim	1
a	1
caprice	1
or	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
partners	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
and	1
our	1
life	1
must	1
go	1
on	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
This	1
is	1
essential	1
for	1
me	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
son	1
I	1
am	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
repented	1
and	1
do	1
repent	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
called	1
forth	1
the	1
present	1
letter	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
cooperate	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
eradicating	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
our	1
estrangement	1
and	1
forgetting	1
the	1
past	1
In	1
the	1
contrary	1
event	1
you	1
can	1
conjecture	1
what	1
awaits	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
son	1
All	1
this	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
discuss	1
more	1
in	1
detail	1
in	1
a	1
personal	1
interview	1
As	1
the	1
season	1
is	1
drawing	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
I	1
would	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
not	1
later	1
than	1
Tuesday	1
All	1
necessary	1
preparations	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
your	1
arrival	1
here	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
note	1
that	1
I	1
attach	1
particular	1
significance	1
to	1
compliance	1
with	1
this	1
request	1
A	1
Karenin	1
P	1
S	1
	1
I	1
enclose	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
needed	1
for	1
your	1
expenses	1
He	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
through	1
and	1
felt	1
pleased	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
remembered	1
to	1
enclose	1
money	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
harsh	1
word	1
not	1
a	1
reproach	1
in	1
it	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
undue	1
indulgence	1
Most	1
of	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
golden	1
bridge	1
for	1
return	1
Folding	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
smoothing	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
massive	1
ivory	1
knife	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
envelope	1
with	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
with	1
the	1
gratification	1
it	1
always	1
afforded	1
him	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
well	1
arranged	1
appointments	1
of	1
his	1
writing	1
table	1
Give	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
courier	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
the	1
summer	1
villa	1
he	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
Certainly	1
your	1
excellency	1
tea	1
to	1
be	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
ordered	1
tea	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
massive	1
paper	1
knife	1
he	1
moved	1
to	1
his	1
easy	1
chair	1
near	1
which	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
ready	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
work	1
on	1
Egyptian	1
hieroglyphics	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
Over	1
the	1
easy	1
chair	1
there	1
hung	1
in	1
a	1
gold	1
frame	1
an	1
oval	1
portrait	1
of	1
Anna	1
a	1
fine	1
painting	1
by	1
a	1
celebrated	1
artist	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
it	1
The	1
unfathomable	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
ironically	1
and	1
insolently	1
at	1
him	1
Insufferably	1
insolent	1
and	1
challenging	1
was	1
the	1
effect	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
lace	1
about	1
the	1
head	1
admirably	1
touched	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
painter	1
the	1
black	1
hair	1
and	1
handsome	1
white	1
hand	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
lifted	1
covered	1
with	1
rings	1
After	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
shuddered	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
he	1
uttered	1
the	1
sound	1
brrr	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
He	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
easy	1
chair	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
book	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
read	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
revive	1
the	1
very	1
vivid	1
interest	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
before	1
in	1
Egyptian	1
hieroglyphics	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
He	1
thought	1
not	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
complication	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
life	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
constituted	1
the	1
chief	1
interest	1
of	1
it	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
penetrated	1
more	1
deeply	1
than	1
ever	1
before	1
into	1
this	1
intricate	1
affair	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
originated	1
a	1
leading	1
idea	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
it	1
without	1
self	1
flattery	1
calculated	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
to	1
strengthen	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
career	1
to	1
discomfit	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
thereby	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
benefit	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
Directly	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
tea	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
Moving	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
a	1
portfolio	1
of	1
papers	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
of	1
self	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
pencil	1
from	1
a	1
rack	1
and	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
perusal	1
of	1
a	1
complex	1
report	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
complication	1
The	1
complication	1
was	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
characteristic	1
quality	1
as	1
a	1
politician	1
that	1
special	1
individual	1
qualification	1
that	1
every	1
rising	1
functionary	1
possesses	1
the	1
qualification	1
that	1
with	1
his	1
unflagging	1
ambition	1
his	1
reserve	1
his	1
honesty	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
self	1
confidence	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
career	1
was	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
red	1
tape	1
his	1
cutting	1
down	1
of	1
correspondence	1
his	1
direct	1
contact	1
wherever	1
possible	1
with	1
the	1
living	1
fact	1
and	1
his	1
economy	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
Commission	1
of	1
the	1
2nd	1
of	1
June	1
had	1
set	1
on	1
foot	1
an	1
inquiry	1
into	1
the	1
irrigation	1
of	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
Zaraisky	1
province	1
which	1
fell	1
under	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
department	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
glaring	1
example	1
of	1
fruitless	1
expenditure	1
and	1
paper	1
reforms	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
The	1
irrigation	1
of	1
these	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
Zaraisky	1
province	1
had	1
been	1
initiated	1
by	1
the	1
predecessor	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
predecessor	1
And	1
vast	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
spent	1
and	1
were	1
still	1
being	1
spent	1
on	1
this	1
business	1
and	1
utterly	1
unproductively	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
could	1
obviously	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
perceived	1
this	1
at	1
once	1
on	1
entering	1
office	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
Board	1
of	1
Irrigation	1
But	1
at	1
first	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
feel	1
secure	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
affect	1
too	1
many	1
interests	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
injudicious	1
Later	1
on	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
engrossed	1
in	1
other	1
questions	1
and	1
had	1
simply	1
forgotten	1
the	1
Board	1
of	1
Irrigation	1
It	1
went	1
of	1
itself	1
like	1
all	1
such	1
boards	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
force	1
of	1
inertia	1
Many	1
people	1
gained	1
their	1
livelihood	1
by	1
the	1
Board	1
of	1
Irrigation	1
especially	1
one	1
highly	1
conscientious	1
and	1
musical	1
family	1
all	1
the	1
daughters	1
played	1
on	1
stringed	1
instruments	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
knew	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
had	1
stood	1
godfather	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elder	1
daughters	1
The	1
raising	1
of	1
this	1
question	1
by	1
a	1
hostile	1
department	1
was	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
opinion	1
a	1
dishonorable	1
proceeding	1
seeing	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
department	1
there	1
were	1
things	1
similar	1
and	1
worse	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
inquired	1
into	1
for	1
well	1
known	1
reasons	1
of	1
official	1

However	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
glove	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
boldly	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
demanded	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
a	1
special	1
commission	1
to	1
investigate	1
and	1
verify	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
the	1
Board	1
of	1
Irrigation	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
Zaraisky	1
province	1
But	1
in	1
compensation	1
he	1
gave	1
no	1
quarter	1
to	1
the	1
enemy	1
either	1
He	1
demanded	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
another	1
special	1
commission	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
Native	1
Tribes	1
Organization	1
Committee	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
Native	1
Tribes	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
incidentally	1
in	1
the	1
Commission	1
of	1
the	1
2nd	1
of	1
June	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
pressed	1
forward	1
actively	1
by	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
one	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
delay	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
deplorable	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
In	1
the	1
commission	1
this	1
question	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
ground	1
of	1
contention	1
between	1
several	1
departments	1
The	1
department	1
hostile	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
flourishing	1
that	1
the	1
proposed	1
reconstruction	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
their	1
prosperity	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
anything	1
wrong	1
it	1
arose	1
mainly	1
from	1
the	1
failure	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
department	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
measures	1
prescribed	1
by	1
law	1
Now	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
intended	1
to	1
demand	1
First	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
commission	1
should	1
be	1
formed	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
empowered	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
secondly	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
appear	1
that	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
actually	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
official	1
documents	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
that	1
another	1
new	1
scientific	1
commission	1
should	1
be	1
appointed	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
deplorable	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
from	1
the	1

4	1
ethnographical	1
5	1
material	1
and	1
6	1
religious	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
thirdly	1
that	1
evidence	1
should	1
be	1
required	1
from	1
the	1
rival	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
ten	1
years	1
by	1
that	1
department	1
for	1
averting	1
the	1
disastrous	1
conditions	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
were	1
now	1
placed	1
and	1
fourthly	1
and	1
finally	1
that	1
that	1
department	1
explain	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
as	1
appeared	1
from	1
the	1

the	1

direct	1
contravention	1
of	1
the	1

the	1
law	1
T	1
Act	1

and	1
the	1
note	1
to	1
Act	1
36	1
A	1
flash	1
of	1
eagerness	1
suffused	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
he	1
rapidly	1
wrote	1
out	1
a	1
synopsis	1
of	1
these	1
ideas	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
benefit	1
Having	1
filled	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
rang	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
certain	1
necessary	1
facts	1
for	1
him	1
Getting	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
frowned	1
and	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
After	1
reading	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
on	1
Egyptian	1
hieroglyphics	1
and	1
renewing	1
his	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
at	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
recollecting	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
the	1
incident	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
now	1
in	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
such	1
a	1
gloomy	1
light	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Though	1
Anna	1
had	1
obstinately	1
and	1
with	1
exasperation	1
contradicted	1
Vronsky	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
their	1
position	1
was	1
impossible	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
regarded	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
as	1
false	1
and	1
dishonorable	1
and	1
she	1
longed	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
change	1
it	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
husband	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
excitement	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
agony	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
After	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
she	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
that	1
now	1
everything	1
was	1
made	1
clear	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
lying	1
and	1
deception	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
was	1
now	1
made	1
clear	1
forever	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
bad	1
this	1
new	1
position	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
clear	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
indefiniteness	1
or	1
falsehood	1
about	1
it	1
The	1
pain	1
she	1
had	1
caused	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
uttering	1
those	1
words	1
would	1
be	1
rewarded	1
now	1
by	1
everything	1
being	1
made	1
clear	1
she	1
thought	1
That	1
evening	1
she	1
saw	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
though	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
position	1
definite	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
When	1
she	1
woke	1
up	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
those	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
now	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
brought	1
herself	1
to	1
utter	1
those	1
strange	1
coarse	1
words	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
But	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
spoken	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
I	1
saw	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
him	1
back	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
changed	1
my	1
mind	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
Why	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
And	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
a	1
burning	1
blush	1
of	1
shame	1
spread	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
knew	1
what	1
had	1
kept	1
her	1
from	1
it	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
ashamed	1
Her	1
position	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
simplified	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
not	1
only	1
not	1
simple	1
but	1
as	1
absolutely	1
hopeless	1
She	1
felt	1
terrified	1
at	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
ever	1
thought	1
before	1
Directly	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
ideas	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
being	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
shame	1
being	1
proclaimed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
She	1
asked	1
herself	1
where	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
When	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
tired	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
offer	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
bitter	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
had	1
continually	1
repeated	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
everyone	1
and	1
everyone	1
had	1
heard	1
them	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
look	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
household	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
go	1
downstairs	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
governess	1
The	1
maid	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
at	1
her	1
door	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
Anna	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
blushed	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
look	1
The	1
maid	1
begged	1
her	1
pardon	1
for	1
coming	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
the	1
bell	1
rang	1
She	1
brought	1
her	1
clothes	1
and	1
a	1
note	1
The	1
note	1
was	1
from	1
Betsy	1
Betsy	1
reminded	1
her	1
that	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
and	1
Baroness	1
Shtoltz	1
were	1
coming	1
to	1
play	1
croquet	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
morning	1
with	1
their	1
adorers	1
Kaluzhsky	1
and	1
old	1
Stremov	1
Come	1
if	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
study	1
in	1
morals	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you	1
she	1
finished	1
Anna	1
read	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
Nothing	1
I	1
need	1
nothing	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Annushka	1
who	1
was	1
rearranging	1
the	1
bottles	1
and	1
brushes	1
on	1
the	1
dressing	1
table	1
You	1
can	1
go	1
I	1
ll	1
dress	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
I	1
need	1
nothing	1
Annushka	1
went	1
out	1
but	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
dressing	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
hands	1
hanging	1
listlessly	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
shivered	1
all	1
over	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
some	1
gesture	1
utter	1
some	1
word	1
and	1
sank	1
back	1
into	1
lifelessness	1
again	1
She	1
repeated	1
continually	1
My	1
God	1
my	1
God	1
But	1
neither	1
God	1
nor	1
my	1
had	1
any	1
meaning	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
seeking	1
help	1
in	1
her	1
difficulty	1
in	1
religion	1
was	1
as	1
remote	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
seeking	1
help	1
from	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
himself	1
although	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
doubts	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
religion	1
was	1
possible	1
only	1
upon	1
condition	1
of	1
renouncing	1
what	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
miserable	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
alarm	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
never	1
experienced	1
before	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
She	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
everything	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
double	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
just	1
as	1
objects	1
sometimes	1
appear	1
double	1
to	1
over	1
tired	1
eyes	1
She	1
hardly	1
knew	1
at	1
times	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
feared	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
hoped	1
for	1
Whether	1
she	1
feared	1
or	1
desired	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
and	1
exactly	1
what	1
she	1
longed	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
Ah	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
doing	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
feeling	1
a	1
sudden	1
thrill	1
of	1
pain	1
in	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
her	1
hair	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
temples	1
and	1
pulling	1
it	1
She	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
about	1
The	1
coffee	1
is	1
ready	1
and	1
mademoiselle	1
and	1
Seryozha	1
are	1
waiting	1
said	1
Annushka	1
coming	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
finding	1
Anna	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
Seryozha	1
What	1
about	1
Seryozha	1
Anna	1
asked	1
with	1
sudden	1
eagerness	1
recollecting	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
existence	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
morning	1
He	1
s	1
been	1
naughty	1
I	1
think	1
answered	1
Annushka	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
In	1
what	1
way	1
Some	1
peaches	1
were	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
room	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
slipped	1
in	1
and	1
ate	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sly	1
The	1
recollection	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
suddenly	1
roused	1
Anna	1
from	1
the	1
helpless	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
She	1
recalled	1
the	1
partly	1
sincere	1
though	1
greatly	1
exaggerated	1
r^ole	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
living	1
for	1
her	1
child	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
with	1
joy	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
plight	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
support	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
relation	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
or	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
This	1
support	1
was	1
her	1
son	1
In	1
whatever	1
position	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
placed	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
lose	1
her	1
son	1
Her	1
husband	1
might	1
put	1
her	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
turn	1
her	1
out	1
Vronsky	1
might	1
grow	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
apart	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
again	1
with	1
bitterness	1
and	1
reproach	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
son	1
She	1
had	1
an	1
aim	1
in	1
life	1
And	1
she	1
must	1
act	1
act	1
to	1
secure	1
this	1
relation	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
her	1
Quickly	1
indeed	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
she	1
must	1
take	1
action	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
her	1
She	1
must	1
take	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
Here	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
She	1
needed	1
consolation	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
insufferable	1
position	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
immediate	1
action	1
binding	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
somewhere	1
with	1
him	1
gave	1
her	1
this	1
consolation	1
She	1
dressed	1
quickly	1
went	1
downstairs	1
and	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
she	1
found	1
as	1
usual	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
coffee	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
his	1
governess	1
Seryozha	1
all	1
in	1
white	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
head	1
bent	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
under	1
a	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
intense	1
concentration	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
well	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
resembled	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
flowers	1
he	1
carried	1
The	1
governess	1
had	1
a	1
particularly	1
severe	1
expression	1
Seryozha	1
screamed	1
shrilly	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
did	1
Ah	1
mamma	1
and	1
stopped	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
greet	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
flowers	1
or	1
to	1
finish	1
making	1
the	1
wreath	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
flowers	1
The	1
governess	1
after	1
saying	1
good	1
morning	1
began	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
detailed	1
account	1
of	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
naughtiness	1
but	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
considering	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
take	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
not	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
take	1
her	1
she	1
decided	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
alone	1
with	1
my	1
child	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
wrong	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
not	1
severely	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
that	1
bewildered	1
and	1
delighted	1
the	1
boy	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
him	1
Leave	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
astonished	1
governess	1
and	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
coffee	1
was	1
set	1
ready	1
for	1
her	1
Mamma	1
I	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
from	1
her	1
expression	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
peaches	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
governess	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
was	1
wrong	1
but	1
you	1
ll	1
never	1
do	1
it	1
again	1
will	1
you	1
You	1
love	1
me	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
tears	1
were	1
coming	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
Can	1
I	1
help	1
loving	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
looking	1
deeply	1
into	1
his	1
scared	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
delighted	1
eyes	1
And	1
can	1
he	1
ever	1
join	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
punishing	1
me	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
feel	1
for	1
me	1
Tears	1
were	1
already	1
flowing	1
down	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
to	1
hide	1
them	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
abruptly	1
and	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
terrace	1
After	1
the	1
thunder	1
showers	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
cold	1
bright	1
weather	1
had	1
set	1
in	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
cold	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
that	1
filtered	1
through	1
the	1
freshly	1
washed	1
leaves	1
She	1
shivered	1
both	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
inward	1
horror	1
which	1
had	1
clutched	1
her	1
with	1
fresh	1
force	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
Run	1
along	1
run	1
along	1
to	1
Mariette	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Seryozha	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
out	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
straw	1
matting	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
won	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
couldn	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
Standing	1
still	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
aspen	1
trees	1
waving	1
in	1
the	1
wind	1
with	1
their	1
freshly	1
washed	1
brightly	1
shining	1
leaves	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
sunshine	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
forgive	1
her	1
that	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
merciless	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
as	1
was	1
that	1
sky	1
that	1
green	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
split	1
in	1
two	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
I	1
mustn	1
t	1
mustn	1
t	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
I	1
must	1
get	1
ready	1
To	1
go	1
where	1
When	1
Whom	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
me	1
Yes	1
to	1
Moscow	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
train	1
Annushka	1
and	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
only	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
things	1
But	1
first	1
I	1
must	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
both	1
She	1
went	1
quickly	1
indoors	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
After	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
I	1
cannot	1
remain	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
and	1
taking	1
my	1
son	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
with	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
parents	1
the	1
son	1
should	1
remain	1
but	1
I	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
me	1
because	1
I	1
cannot	1
live	1
without	1
him	1
Be	1
generous	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
Up	1
to	1
this	1
point	1
she	1
wrote	1
rapidly	1
and	1
naturally	1
but	1
the	1
appeal	1
to	1
his	1
generosity	1
a	1
quality	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
with	1
something	1
touching	1
pulled	1
her	1
up	1
Of	1
my	1
fault	1
and	1
my	1
remorse	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak	1
because	1
She	1
stopped	1
again	1
finding	1
no	1
connection	1
in	1
her	1
ideas	1
No	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
anything	1
and	1
tearing	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
wrote	1
it	1
again	1
leaving	1
out	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
generosity	1
and	1
sealed	1
it	1
up	1
Another	1
letter	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
my	1
husband	1
she	1
wrote	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
unable	1
to	1
write	1
more	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
coarse	1
so	1
unfeminine	1
And	1
what	1
more	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
Again	1
a	1
flush	1
of	1
shame	1
spread	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
recalled	1
his	1
composure	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
against	1
him	1
impelled	1
her	1
to	1
tear	1
the	1
sheet	1
with	1
the	1
phrase	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
into	1
tiny	1
bits	1
No	1
need	1
of	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
closing	1
her	1
blotting	1
case	1
she	1
went	1
upstairs	1
told	1
the	1
governess	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
pack	1
up	1
her	1
things	1
Chapter	1
16	1
All	1
the	1
rooms	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
villa	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
porters	1
gardeners	1
and	1
footmen	1
going	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
carrying	1
out	1
things	1
Cupboards	1
and	1
chests	1
were	1
open	1
twice	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
shop	1
for	1
cord	1
pieces	1
of	1
newspaper	1
were	1
tossing	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
Two	1
trunks	1
some	1
bags	1
and	1
strapped	1
up	1
rugs	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
The	1
carriage	1
and	1
two	1
hired	1
cabs	1
were	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
Anna	1
forgetting	1
her	1
inward	1
agitation	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
packing	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
in	1
her	1
boudoir	1
packing	1
her	1
traveling	1
bag	1
when	1
Annushka	1
called	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
some	1
carriage	1
driving	1
up	1
Anna	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
courier	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
ringing	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
bell	1
Run	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
folding	1
her	1
hands	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
A	1
footman	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
packet	1
directed	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
hand	1
The	1
courier	1
has	1
orders	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
he	1
said	1
Very	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
tore	1
open	1
the	1
letter	1
with	1
trembling	1
fingers	1
A	1
roll	1
of	1
unfolded	1
notes	1
done	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
wrapper	1
fell	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
She	1
disengaged	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
Preparations	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
your	1
arrival	1
here	1
I	1
attach	1
particular	1
significance	1
to	1
compliance	1
she	1
read	1
She	1
ran	1
on	1
then	1
back	1
read	1
it	1
all	1
through	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
all	1
through	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
cold	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
fearful	1
calamity	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
had	1
burst	1
upon	1
her	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
had	1
regretted	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
could	1
be	1
unspoken	1
And	1
here	1
this	1
letter	1
regarded	1
them	1
as	1
unspoken	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
wanted	1
But	1
now	1
this	1
letter	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
more	1
awful	1
than	1
anything	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
conceive	1
He	1
s	1
right	1
she	1
said	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
s	1
always	1
right	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
Christian	1
he	1
s	1
generous	1
Yes	1
vile	1
base	1
creature	1
And	1
no	1
one	1
understands	1
it	1
except	1
me	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
will	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
explain	1
it	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
religious	1
so	1
high	1
principled	1
so	1
upright	1
so	1
clever	1
but	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
They	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
crushed	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
eight	1
years	1
crushed	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
me	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
once	1
even	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
live	1
woman	1
who	1
must	1
have	1
love	1
They	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
s	1
humiliated	1
me	1
and	1
been	1
just	1
as	1
pleased	1
with	1
himself	1
Haven	1
t	1
I	1
striven	1
striven	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
strength	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
give	1
meaning	1
to	1
my	1
life	1
Haven	1
t	1
I	1
struggled	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
to	1
love	1
my	1
son	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
my	1
husband	1
But	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
when	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
cheat	1
myself	1
any	1
longer	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
alive	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
God	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
love	1
and	1
live	1
And	1
now	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
do	1
If	1
he	1
d	1
killed	1
me	1
if	1
he	1
d	1
killed	1
him	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
anything	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
forgiven	1
anything	1
but	1
no	1
he	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
He	1
s	1
doing	1
just	1
what	1
s	1
characteristic	1
of	1
his	1
mean	1
character	1
He	1
ll	1
keep	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
while	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
ruin	1
he	1
ll	1
drive	1
still	1
lower	1
to	1
worse	1
ruin	1
yet	1
She	1
recalled	1
the	1
words	1
from	1
the	1
letter	1
You	1
can	1
conjecture	1
what	1
awaits	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
son	1
That	1
s	1
a	1
threat	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
child	1
and	1
most	1
likely	1
by	1
their	1
stupid	1
law	1
he	1
can	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
why	1
he	1
says	1
it	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
believe	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
my	1
child	1
or	1
he	1
despises	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
ridicule	1
it	1
He	1
despises	1
that	1
feeling	1
in	1
me	1
but	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
abandon	1
my	1
child	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
abandon	1
my	1
child	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
life	1
for	1
me	1
without	1
my	1
child	1
even	1
with	1
him	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
abandoned	1
my	1
child	1
and	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
acting	1
like	1
the	1
most	1
infamous	1
basest	1
of	1
women	1
He	1
knows	1
that	1
and	1
knows	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
incapable	1
of	1
doing	1
that	1
She	1
recalled	1
another	1
sentence	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
Our	1
life	1
must	1
go	1
on	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
That	1
life	1
was	1
miserable	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
awful	1
of	1
late	1
What	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
now	1
And	1
he	1
knows	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
repent	1
that	1
I	1
breathe	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
he	1
knows	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
lying	1
and	1
deceit	1
but	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
torturing	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
is	1
happy	1
in	1
deceit	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
give	1
him	1
that	1
happiness	1
I	1
ll	1
break	1
through	1
the	1
spiderweb	1
of	1
lies	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
catch	1
me	1
come	1
what	1
may	1
Anything	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
lying	1
and	1
deceit	1
But	1
how	1
My	1
God	1
my	1
God	1
Was	1
ever	1
a	1
woman	1
so	1
miserable	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
No	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
through	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
through	1
it	1
she	1
cried	1
jumping	1
up	1
and	1
keeping	1
back	1
her	1
tears	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
to	1
write	1
him	1
another	1
letter	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
anything	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
position	1
however	1
false	1
and	1
dishonorable	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
writing	1
she	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
laying	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
them	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
heaving	1
breast	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
crying	1
She	1
was	1
weeping	1
that	1
her	1
dream	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
being	1
made	1
clear	1
and	1
definite	1
had	1
been	1
annihilated	1
forever	1
She	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
and	1
far	1
worse	1
indeed	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
and	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
consequence	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
this	1
position	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
exchange	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
shameful	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
has	1
abandoned	1
husband	1
and	1
child	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
lover	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
she	1
might	1
struggle	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
herself	1
She	1
would	1
never	1
know	1
freedom	1
in	1
love	1
but	1
would	1
remain	1
forever	1
a	1
guilty	1
wife	1
with	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
detection	1
hanging	1
over	1
her	1
at	1
every	1
instant	1
deceiving	1
her	1
husband	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
shameful	1
connection	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
living	1
apart	1
and	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
whose	1
life	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
share	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
conceive	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
end	1
in	1
And	1
she	1
cried	1
without	1
restraint	1
as	1
children	1
cry	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
punished	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
s	1
steps	1
forced	1
her	1
to	1
rouse	1
herself	1
and	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
writing	1
The	1
courier	1
asks	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
an	1
answer	1
the	1
footman	1
announced	1
An	1
answer	1
Yes	1
said	1
Anna	1
Let	1
him	1
wait	1
I	1
ll	1
ring	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
write	1
she	1
thought	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
decide	1
upon	1
alone	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
want	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
I	1
care	1
for	1
Again	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
split	1
in	1
two	1
She	1
was	1
terrified	1
again	1
at	1
this	1
feeling	1
and	1
clutched	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
pretext	1
for	1
doing	1
something	1
which	1
might	1
divert	1
her	1
thoughts	1
from	1
herself	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
Alexey	1
so	1
she	1
called	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
he	1
can	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
Betsy	1
s	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
there	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
either	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
your	1
letter	1
A	1
and	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
We	1
are	1

she	1
said	1
to	1
Annushka	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
Not	1

Chapter	1
17	1
The	1
croquet	1
party	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
had	1
invited	1
Anna	1
was	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
two	1
ladies	1
and	1
their	1
adorers	1
These	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
the	1
chief	1
representatives	1
of	1
a	1
select	1
new	1
Petersburg	1
circle	1
nicknamed	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
some	1
imitation	1
les	1
sept	1
merveilles	1
du	1
monde	1
These	1
ladies	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
circle	1
which	1
though	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
was	1
utterly	1
hostile	1
to	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
Anna	1
moved	1
Moreover	1
Stremov	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
influential	1
people	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
the	1
elderly	1
admirer	1
of	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
was	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
enemy	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
world	1
From	1
all	1
these	1
considerations	1
Anna	1
had	1
not	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
hints	1
in	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
note	1
referred	1
to	1
her	1
refusal	1
But	1
now	1
Anna	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
Vronsky	1
Anna	1
arrived	1
at	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
earlier	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
guests	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
footman	1
with	1
side	1
whiskers	1
combed	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
Kammerjunker	1
went	1
in	1
too	1
He	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
Anna	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
recalled	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
Most	1
likely	1
he	1
was	1
sending	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
As	1
she	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
outer	1
garment	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
footman	1
pronouncing	1
his	1
r	1
s	1
even	1
like	1
a	1
Kammerjunker	1
say	1
From	1
the	1
count	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hand	1
the	1
note	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
question	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
and	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
or	1
to	1
go	1
herself	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
But	1
neither	1
the	1
first	1
nor	1
the	1
second	1
nor	1
the	1
third	1
course	1
was	1
possible	1
Already	1
she	1
heard	1
bells	1
ringing	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
arrival	1
ahead	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
footman	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1
The	1
princess	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
they	1
will	1
inform	1
her	1
immediately	1
Would	1
you	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
walk	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
announced	1
another	1
footman	1
in	1
another	1
room	1
The	1
position	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
of	1
indecision	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
at	1
home	1
worse	1
in	1
fact	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
step	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
here	1
among	1
outsiders	1
in	1
company	1
so	1
uncongenial	1
to	1
her	1
present	1
mood	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
dress	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
suited	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
alone	1
all	1
around	1
was	1
that	1
luxurious	1
setting	1
of	1
idleness	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
less	1
wretched	1
than	1
at	1
home	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
forced	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
Everything	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
of	1
itself	1
On	1
meeting	1
Betsy	1
coming	1
towards	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
gown	1
that	1
struck	1
her	1
by	1
its	1
elegance	1
Anna	1
smiled	1
at	1
her	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
was	1
walking	1
with	1
Tushkevitch	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
a	1
relation	1
who	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
joy	1
of	1
her	1
parents	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
was	1
spending	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
the	1
fashionable	1
princess	1
There	1
was	1
probably	1
something	1
unusual	1
about	1
Anna	1
for	1
Betsy	1
noticed	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
I	1
slept	1
badly	1
answered	1
Anna	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
supposed	1
brought	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
note	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
said	1
Betsy	1
I	1
m	1
tired	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
longing	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
tea	1
before	1
they	1
come	1
You	1
might	1
go	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Tushkevitch	1
with	1
Masha	1
and	1
try	1
the	1
croquet	1
ground	1
over	1
there	1
where	1
they	1
ve	1
been	1
cutting	1
it	1
We	1
shall	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
talk	1
a	1
little	1
over	1
tea	1
we	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
cozy	1
chat	1
eh	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
English	1
to	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
pressing	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
parasol	1
Yes	1
especially	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
stay	1
very	1
long	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
forced	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
old	1
Madame	1
Vrede	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
promising	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
century	1
said	1
Anna	1
to	1
whom	1
lying	1
alien	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
nature	1
had	1
become	1
not	1
merely	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
in	1
society	1
but	1
a	1
positive	1
source	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
Why	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
explained	1
She	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
as	1
Vronsky	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
here	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
secure	1
her	1
own	1
freedom	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
somehow	1
But	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
old	1
Madame	1
Vrede	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
other	1
people	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
explained	1
and	1
yet	1
as	1
it	1
afterwards	1
turned	1
out	1
had	1
she	1
contrived	1
the	1
most	1
cunning	1
devices	1
to	1
meet	1
Vronsky	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
better	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
for	1
anything	1
answered	1
Betsy	1
looking	1
intently	1
into	1
Anna	1
s	1

Really	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
offended	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
afraid	1
my	1
society	1
would	1
compromise	1
you	1
Tea	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
dining	1
room	1
please	1
she	1
said	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
addressing	1
the	1
footman	1
Taking	1
the	1
note	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
Alexey	1
s	1
playing	1
us	1
false	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
he	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
come	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
simple	1
and	1
natural	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
enter	1
her	1
head	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
mean	1
anything	1
more	1
to	1
Anna	1
than	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
croquet	1
Anna	1
knew	1
that	1
Betsy	1
knew	1
everything	1
but	1
hearing	1
how	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
almost	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing	1
Ah	1
said	1
Anna	1
indifferently	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
greatly	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
smiling	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
friends	1
compromise	1
anyone	1
This	1
playing	1
with	1
words	1
this	1
hiding	1
of	1
a	1
secret	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
fascination	1
for	1
Anna	1
as	1
indeed	1
it	1
has	1
for	1
all	1
women	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
concealment	1
not	1
the	1
aim	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
concealment	1
was	1
contrived	1
but	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
concealment	1
itself	1
which	1
attracted	1
her	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
more	1
Catholic	1
than	1
the	1
Pope	1
she	1
said	1
Stremov	1
and	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
why	1
they	1
re	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
society	1
Besides	1
they	1
re	1
received	1
everywhere	1
and	1
I	1
she	1
laid	1
special	1
stress	1
on	1
the	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
strict	1
and	1
intolerant	1
It	1
s	1
simply	1
that	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
time	1
No	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
perhaps	1
to	1
meet	1
Stremov	1
Let	1
him	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
tilt	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
committee	1
that	1
s	1
no	1
affair	1
of	1
ours	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
s	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
man	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
a	1
devoted	1
croquet	1
player	1
You	1
shall	1
see	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
absurd	1
position	1
as	1
Liza	1
s	1
lovesick	1
swain	1
at	1
his	1
age	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
carries	1
off	1
the	1
absurd	1
position	1
He	1
s	1
very	1
nice	1
Sappho	1

don	1

Oh	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
type	1
quite	1
new	1
Betsy	1
said	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
from	1
her	1
good	1
humored	1
shrewd	1
glance	1
Anna	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
partly	1
guessed	1
her	1
plight	1
and	1
was	1
hatching	1
something	1
for	1
her	1
benefit	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
boudoir	1
I	1
must	1
write	1
to	1
Alexey	1
though	1
and	1
Betsy	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
scribbled	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
note	1
in	1
an	1
envelope	1
I	1
m	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
I	1
ve	1
one	1
lady	1
extra	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
in	1
Look	1
what	1
I	1
ve	1
said	1
will	1
that	1
persuade	1
him	1
Excuse	1
me	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
Would	1
you	1
seal	1
it	1
up	1
please	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
off	1
she	1
said	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
directions	1
Without	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
thought	1
Anna	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
Betsy	1
s	1
letter	1
and	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
wrote	1
below	1
It	1
s	1
essential	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
Come	1
to	1
the	1
Vrede	1
garden	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
at	1
six	1
o	1
clock	1
She	1
sealed	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
Betsy	1
coming	1
back	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
handed	1
the	1
note	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
At	1
tea	1
which	1
was	1
brought	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
tea	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
cozy	1
chat	1
promised	1
by	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
before	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
her	1
visitors	1
really	1
did	1
come	1
off	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
They	1
criticized	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
were	1
expecting	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
fell	1
upon	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
She	1
s	1
very	1
sweet	1
and	1
I	1
always	1
liked	1
her	1
said	1
Anna	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
like	1
her	1
She	1
raves	1
about	1
you	1
Yesterday	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
despair	1
at	1
not	1
finding	1
you	1
She	1
says	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
real	1
heroine	1
of	1
romance	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
a	1
man	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
mad	1
things	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
Stremov	1
says	1
she	1
does	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
But	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
please	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
said	1
Anna	1
after	1
being	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
showed	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
asking	1
an	1
idle	1
question	1
but	1
that	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
asking	1
was	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
please	1
what	1
are	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
Prince	1
Kaluzhsky	1
Mishka	1
as	1
he	1
s	1
called	1
I	1
ve	1
met	1
them	1
so	1
little	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
Betsy	1
smiled	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
Anna	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
manner	1
she	1
said	1
They	1
ve	1
all	1
adopted	1
that	1
manner	1
They	1
ve	1
flung	1
their	1
caps	1
over	1
the	1
windmills	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
ways	1
and	1
ways	1
of	1
flinging	1
them	1
Yes	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
her	1
relations	1
precisely	1
with	1
Kaluzhsky	1
Betsy	1
broke	1
into	1
unexpectedly	1
mirthful	1
and	1
irrepressible	1
laughter	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
rarely	1
happened	1
with	1
her	1
You	1
re	1
encroaching	1
on	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
s	1
special	1
domain	1
now	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
an	1
enfant	1
terrible	1
and	1
Betsy	1
obviously	1
tried	1
to	1
restrain	1
herself	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
peals	1
of	1
that	1
infectious	1
laughter	1
that	1
people	1
laugh	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
laugh	1
often	1
You	1
d	1
better	1
ask	1
them	1
she	1
brought	1
out	1
between	1
tears	1
of	1
laughter	1
No	1
you	1
laugh	1
said	1
Anna	1
laughing	1
too	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
the	1
husband	1
s	1
r^ole	1
in	1
it	1
The	1
husband	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
s	1
husband	1
carries	1
her	1
shawl	1
and	1
is	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
But	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
in	1
reality	1
no	1
one	1
cares	1
to	1
inquire	1
You	1
know	1
in	1
decent	1
society	1
one	1
doesn	1
t	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
even	1
of	1
certain	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
toilet	1
That	1
s	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
this	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
at	1
Madame	1
Rolandak	1
s	1
f^ete	1
asked	1
Anna	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
so	1
answered	1
Betsy	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
she	1
began	1
filling	1
the	1
little	1
transparent	1
cups	1
with	1
fragrant	1
tea	1
Putting	1
a	1
cup	1
before	1
Anna	1
she	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1
and	1
fitting	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
silver	1
holder	1
she	1
lighted	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
like	1
this	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
a	1
fortunate	1
position	1
she	1
began	1
quite	1
serious	1
now	1
as	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
cup	1
I	1
understand	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
Liza	1
Liza	1
now	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
na"ive	1
natures	1
that	1
like	1
children	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
s	1
good	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
bad	1
Anyway	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1
comprehend	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
young	1
And	1
now	1
she	1
s	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
comprehension	1
suits	1
her	1
Now	1
perhaps	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
know	1
on	1
purpose	1
said	1
Betsy	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
But	1
anyway	1
it	1
suits	1
her	1
The	1
very	1
same	1
thing	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
see	1
may	1
be	1
looked	1
at	1
tragically	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
misery	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
looked	1
at	1
simply	1
and	1
even	1
humorously	1
Possibly	1
you	1
are	1
inclined	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
things	1
too	1
tragically	1
How	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
other	1
people	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
myself	1
said	1
Anna	1
seriously	1
and	1
dreamily	1
Am	1
I	1
worse	1
than	1
other	1
people	1
or	1
better	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
m	1
worse	1
Enfant	1
terrible	1
enfant	1
terrible	1
	1
repeated	1
Betsy	1
But	1
here	1
they	1
are	1
Chapter	1
18	1
They	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
voice	1
then	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
laughter	1
and	1
immediately	1
thereafter	1
there	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
expected	1
guests	1
Sappho	1
Shtoltz	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
beaming	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
health	1
the	1
so	1
called	1
Vaska	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
ample	1
supplies	1
of	1
beefsteak	1
truffles	1
and	1
Burgundy	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
reach	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
fitting	1
hour	1
Vaska	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
them	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
one	1
second	1
He	1
walked	1
after	1
Sappho	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
followed	1
her	1
about	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
chained	1
to	1
her	1
keeping	1
his	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
eat	1
her	1
Sappho	1
Shtoltz	1
was	1
a	1
blonde	1
beauty	1
with	1
black	1
eyes	1
She	1
walked	1
with	1
smart	1
little	1
steps	1
in	1
high	1
heeled	1
shoes	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
vigorously	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
Anna	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
this	1
new	1
star	1
of	1
fashion	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
the	1
exaggerated	1
extreme	1
to	1
which	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
carried	1
and	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
her	1
manners	1
On	1
her	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
superstructure	1
of	1
soft	1
golden	1
hair	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
false	1
mixed	1
that	1
her	1
head	1
was	1
equal	1
in	1
size	1
to	1
the	1
elegantly	1
rounded	1
bust	1
of	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
exposed	1
in	1
front	1
The	1
impulsive	1
abruptness	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
legs	1
were	1
distinctly	1
marked	1
under	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
involuntarily	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
where	1
in	1
the	1
undulating	1
piled	1
up	1
mountain	1
of	1
material	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
the	1
real	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
so	1
small	1
and	1
slender	1
so	1
naked	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
so	1
hidden	1
behind	1
and	1
below	1
really	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
Betsy	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
introduce	1
her	1
to	1
Anna	1
Only	1
fancy	1
we	1
all	1
but	1
ran	1
over	1
two	1
soldiers	1
she	1
began	1
telling	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
using	1
her	1
eyes	1
smiling	1
and	1
twitching	1
away	1
her	1
tail	1
which	1
she	1
flung	1
back	1
at	1
one	1
stroke	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
I	1
drove	1
here	1
with	1
Vaska	1
Ah	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
each	1
other	1
And	1
mentioning	1
his	1
surname	1
she	1
introduced	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
reddening	1
a	1
little	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
ringing	1
laugh	1
at	1
her	1
mistake	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
her	1
having	1
called	1
him	1
Vaska	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
Vaska	1
bowed	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
Anna	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
addressed	1
Sappho	1
You	1
ve	1
lost	1
your	1
bet	1
We	1
got	1
here	1
first	1
Pay	1
up	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
Sappho	1
laughed	1
still	1
more	1
festively	1
Not	1
just	1
now	1
said	1
she	1
Oh	1
all	1
right	1
I	1
ll	1
have	1
it	1
later	1
Very	1
well	1
very	1
well	1
Oh	1
yes	1
She	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
to	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
nice	1
person	1
I	1
positively	1
forgot	1
it	1
I	1
ve	1
brought	1
you	1
a	1
visitor	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
comes	1
The	1
unexpected	1
young	1
visitor	1
whom	1
Sappho	1
had	1
invited	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
was	1
however	1
a	1
personage	1
of	1
such	1
consequence	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
both	1
the	1
ladies	1
rose	1
on	1
his	1
entrance	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
admirer	1
of	1
Sappho	1
s	1
He	1
now	1
dogged	1
her	1
footsteps	1
like	1
Vaska	1
Soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Kaluzhsky	1
arrived	1
and	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
with	1
Stremov	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
was	1
a	1
thin	1
brunette	1
with	1
an	1
Oriental	1
languid	1
type	1
of	1
face	1
and	1
as	1
everyone	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
exquisite	1
enigmatic	1
eyes	1
The	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
dark	1
dress	1
Anna	1
immediately	1
observed	1
and	1
appreciated	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
in	1
perfect	1
harmony	1
with	1
her	1
style	1
of	1
beauty	1
Liza	1
was	1
as	1
soft	1
and	1
enervated	1
as	1
Sappho	1
was	1
smart	1
and	1
abrupt	1
But	1
to	1
Anna	1
s	1
taste	1
Liza	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
attractive	1
Betsy	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Anna	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
adopted	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
an	1
innocent	1
child	1
but	1
when	1
Anna	1
saw	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
truth	1
She	1
really	1
was	1
both	1
innocent	1
and	1
corrupt	1
but	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
passive	1
woman	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
her	1
tone	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Sappho	1
s	1
that	1
like	1
Sappho	1
she	1
had	1
two	1
men	1
one	1
young	1
and	1
one	1
old	1
tacked	1
onto	1
her	1
and	1
devouring	1
her	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
higher	1
than	1
what	1
surrounded	1
her	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
diamond	1
among	1
glass	1
imitations	1
This	1
glow	1
shone	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
exquisite	1
truly	1
enigmatic	1
eyes	1
The	1
weary	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
passionate	1
glance	1
of	1
those	1
eyes	1
encircled	1
by	1
dark	1
rings	1
impressed	1
one	1
by	1
its	1
perfect	1
sincerity	1
Everyone	1
looking	1
into	1
those	1
eyes	1
fancied	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
wholly	1
and	1
knowing	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
love	1
her	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Anna	1
her	1
whole	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
Ah	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
Yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
all	1
I	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
you	1
d	1
gone	1
away	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
yesterday	1
especially	1
Wasn	1
t	1
it	1
awful	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
Anna	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
lay	1
bare	1
all	1
her	1
soul	1
Yes	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
thrilling	1
said	1
Anna	1
blushing	1
The	1
company	1
got	1
up	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
said	1
Liza	1
smiling	1
and	1
settling	1
herself	1
close	1
to	1
Anna	1
You	1
won	1
t	1
go	1
either	1
will	1
you	1
Who	1
wants	1
to	1
play	1
croquet	1
Oh	1
I	1
like	1
it	1
said	1
Anna	1
There	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
manage	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
by	1
things	1
It	1
s	1
delightful	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
You	1
re	1
alive	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
bored	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
bored	1
Why	1
you	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
liveliest	1
set	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
said	1
Anna	1
Possibly	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
our	1
set	1
are	1
even	1
more	1
bored	1
but	1
we	1
I	1
certainly	1
are	1
not	1
happy	1
but	1
awfully	1
awfully	1
bored	1
Sappho	1
smoking	1
a	1
cigarette	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
Betsy	1
and	1
Stremov	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
What	1
bored	1
said	1
Betsy	1
Sappho	1
says	1
they	1
did	1
enjoy	1
themselves	1
tremendously	1
at	1
your	1
house	1
last	1
night	1
Ah	1
how	1
dreary	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
said	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
We	1
all	1
drove	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
place	1
after	1
the	1
races	1
And	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
people	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
Always	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
We	1
lounged	1
about	1
on	1
sofas	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
enjoy	1
in	1
that	1
No	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
manage	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
she	1
said	1
addressing	1
Anna	1
again	1
One	1
has	1
but	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
and	1
one	1
sees	1
here	1
s	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
happy	1
or	1
unhappy	1
but	1
isn	1
t	1
bored	1
Tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
I	1
do	1
nothing	1
answered	1
Anna	1
blushing	1
at	1
these	1
searching	1
questions	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
Stremov	1
put	1
in	1
Stremov	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
fifty	1
partly	1
gray	1
but	1
still	1
vigorous	1
looking	1
very	1
ugly	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
characteristic	1
and	1
intelligent	1
face	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
was	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
niece	1
and	1
he	1
spent	1
all	1
his	1
leisure	1
hours	1
with	1
her	1
On	1
meeting	1
Anna	1
Karenina	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
enemy	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
he	1
tried	1
like	1
a	1
shrewd	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
cordial	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
enemy	1
Nothing	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
way	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
long	1
ago	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
think	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
afraid	1
of	1
sleeplessness	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
has	1
just	1
said	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
for	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
only	1
clever	1
but	1
true	1
said	1
Anna	1
smiling	1
No	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
being	1
bored	1
To	1
sleep	1
well	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
to	1
enjoy	1
oneself	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
work	1
too	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
work	1
for	1
when	1
my	1
work	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anybody	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
won	1
t	1
knowingly	1
make	1
a	1
pretense	1
about	1
it	1
You	1
re	1
incorrigible	1
said	1
Stremov	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
again	1
to	1
Anna	1
As	1
he	1
rarely	1
met	1
Anna	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
but	1
commonplaces	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
those	1
commonplaces	1
as	1
to	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
how	1
fond	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
which	1
suggested	1
that	1
he	1
longed	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
to	1
please	1
her	1
and	1
show	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
Tushkevitch	1
came	1
in	1
announcing	1
that	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
awaiting	1
the	1
other	1
players	1
to	1
begin	1
croquet	1
No	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
away	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
pleaded	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
hearing	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
going	1
Stremov	1
joined	1
in	1
her	1
entreaties	1
It	1
s	1
too	1
violent	1
a	1
transition	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
go	1
from	1
such	1
company	1
to	1
old	1
Madame	1
Vrede	1
And	1
besides	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
talking	1
scandal	1
while	1
here	1
you	1
arouse	1
none	1
but	1
such	1
different	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
and	1
most	1
opposite	1
kind	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Anna	1
pondered	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
This	1
shrewd	1
man	1
s	1
flattering	1
words	1
the	1
na"ive	1
childlike	1
affection	1
shown	1
her	1
by	1
Liza	1
Merkalova	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
social	1
atmosphere	1
she	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
easy	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
so	1
difficult	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
whether	1
to	1
remain	1
whether	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
the	1
painful	1
moment	1
of	1
explanation	1
But	1
remembering	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
her	1
alone	1
at	1
home	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
some	1
decision	1
remembering	1
that	1
gesture	1
terrible	1
even	1
in	1
memory	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
clutched	1
her	1
hair	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
she	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
Chapter	1
19	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
apparently	1
frivolous	1
life	1
in	1
society	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
hated	1
irregularity	1
In	1
early	1
youth	1
in	1
the	1
Corps	1
of	1
Pages	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
a	1
refusal	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
being	1
in	1
difficulties	1
to	1
borrow	1
money	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
once	1
put	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
again	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
affairs	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
order	1
he	1
used	1
about	1
five	1
times	1
a	1
year	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
frequently	1
according	1
to	1
circumstances	1
to	1
shut	1
himself	1
up	1
alone	1
and	1
put	1
all	1
his	1
affairs	1
into	1
definite	1
shape	1
This	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
his	1
day	1
of	1
reckoning	1
or	1
faire	1
la	1
lessive	1
On	1
waking	1
up	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
races	1
Vronsky	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
linen	1
coat	1
and	1
without	1
shaving	1
or	1
taking	1
his	1
bath	1
he	1
distributed	1
about	1
the	1
table	1
moneys	1
bills	1
and	1
letters	1
and	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
Petritsky	1
who	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
tempered	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
on	1
waking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
his	1
comrade	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
quietly	1
dressed	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
without	1
getting	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
Every	1
man	1
who	1
knows	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
all	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
surrounding	1
him	1
cannot	1
help	1
imagining	1
that	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
these	1
conditions	1
and	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
clear	1
is	1
something	1
exceptional	1
and	1
personal	1
peculiar	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
never	1
supposes	1
that	1
others	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
just	1
as	1
complicated	1
an	1
array	1
of	1
personal	1
affairs	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
So	1
indeed	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
And	1
not	1
without	1
inward	1
pride	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
reason	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
would	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
difficulties	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
forced	1
to	1
some	1
dishonorable	1
course	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
difficult	1
position	1
But	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
that	1
now	1
especially	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
and	1
define	1
his	1
position	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
avoid	1
getting	1
into	1
difficulties	1
What	1
Vronsky	1
attacked	1
first	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
easiest	1
was	1
his	1
pecuniary	1
position	1
Writing	1
out	1
on	1
note	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
minute	1
hand	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
owed	1
he	1
added	1
up	1
the	1
amount	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to	1
seventeen	1
thousand	1
and	1
some	1
odd	1
hundreds	1
which	1
he	1
left	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
clearness	1
Reckoning	1
up	1
his	1
money	1
and	1
his	1
bank	1
book	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
one	1
thousand	1
eight	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
and	1
nothing	1
coming	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
New	1
Year	1
Reckoning	1
over	1
again	1
his	1
list	1
of	1
debts	1
Vronsky	1
copied	1
it	1
dividing	1
it	1
into	1
three	1
classes	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
debts	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
have	1
the	1
money	1
ready	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
demand	1
for	1
payment	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
delay	1
in	1
paying	1
Such	1
debts	1
amounted	1
to	1
about	1
four	1
thousand	1
one	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
for	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
as	1
surety	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
comrade	1
Venovsky	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
that	1
sum	1
to	1
a	1
cardsharper	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
presence	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
money	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
amount	1
then	1
but	1
Venovsky	1
and	1
Yashvin	1
had	1
insisted	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
pay	1
and	1
not	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
played	1
That	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
well	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
dirty	1
business	1
though	1
his	1
only	1
share	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
undertaking	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth	1
to	1
be	1
surety	1
for	1
Venovsky	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
two	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
fling	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
swindler	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
so	1
for	1
this	1
first	1
and	1
most	1
important	1
division	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
four	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
The	1
second	1
class	1
eight	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
consisted	1
of	1
less	1
important	1
debts	1
These	1
were	1
principally	1
accounts	1
owing	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
race	1
horses	1
to	1
the	1
purveyor	1
of	1
oats	1
and	1
hay	1
the	1
English	1
saddler	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
some	1
two	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
on	1
these	1
debts	1
too	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
free	1
from	1
anxiety	1
The	1
last	1
class	1
of	1
debts	1
to	1
shops	1
to	1
hotels	1
to	1
his	1
tailor	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
considered	1
So	1
that	1
he	1
needed	1
at	1
least	1
six	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
for	1
current	1
expenses	1
and	1
he	1
only	1
had	1
one	1
thousand	1
eight	1
hundred	1
For	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
one	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
of	1
revenue	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
everyone	1
fixed	1
as	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
income	1
such	1
debts	1
one	1
would	1
suppose	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
embarrassing	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
one	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
His	1
father	1
s	1
immense	1
property	1
which	1
alone	1
yielded	1
a	1
yearly	1
income	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
was	1
left	1
undivided	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
elder	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
debts	1
married	1
Princess	1
Varya	1
Tchirkova	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
Decembrist	1
without	1
any	1
fortune	1
whatever	1
Alexey	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
income	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
estate	1
reserving	1
for	1
himself	1
only	1
twenty	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
from	1
it	1
Alexey	1
had	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
that	1
sum	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
for	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
married	1
which	1
he	1
probably	1
never	1
would	1
do	1
And	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
expensive	1
regiments	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
married	1
could	1
not	1
decline	1
the	1
gift	1
His	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
her	1
own	1
separate	1
property	1
had	1
allowed	1
Alexey	1
every	1
year	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
twenty	1
five	1
thousand	1
he	1
had	1
reserved	1
and	1
Alexey	1
had	1
spent	1
it	1
all	1
Of	1
late	1
his	1
mother	1
incensed	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
affair	1
and	1
his	1
leaving	1
Moscow	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
sending	1
him	1
the	1
money	1
And	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
forty	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
having	1
only	1
received	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
that	1
year	1
found	1
himself	1
now	1
in	1
difficulties	1
To	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
difficulties	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
apply	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
for	1
money	1
Her	1
last	1
letter	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
had	1
particularly	1
exasperated	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hints	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
succeed	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
lead	1
a	1
life	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
scandal	1
to	1
all	1
good	1
society	1
His	1
mother	1
s	1
attempt	1
to	1
buy	1
him	1
stung	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
colder	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
generous	1
word	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
once	1
uttered	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
vaguely	1
foreseeing	1
certain	1
eventualities	1
in	1
his	1
intrigue	1
with	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
that	1
this	1
generous	1
word	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
thoughtlessly	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
married	1
he	1
might	1
need	1
all	1
the	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
of	1
income	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
draw	1
back	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
recall	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
to	1
remember	1
how	1
that	1
sweet	1
delightful	1
Varya	1
sought	1
at	1
every	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
remembered	1
his	1
generosity	1
and	1
appreciated	1
it	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
taking	1
back	1
his	1
gift	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
beating	1
a	1
woman	1
stealing	1
or	1
lying	1
One	1
thing	1
only	1
could	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
determined	1
upon	1
it	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
hesitation	1
to	1
borrow	1
money	1
from	1
a	1
money	1
lender	1
ten	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
a	1
proceeding	1
which	1
presented	1
no	1
difficulty	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
his	1
expenses	1
generally	1
and	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
race	1
horses	1
Resolving	1
on	1
this	1
he	1
promptly	1
wrote	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
Rolandak	1
who	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
sent	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
offers	1
to	1
buy	1
horses	1
from	1
him	1
Then	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
Englishman	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
lender	1
and	1
divided	1
what	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
accounts	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
pay	1
Having	1
finished	1
this	1
business	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
cutting	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
notebook	1
three	1
notes	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
read	1
them	1
again	1
burned	1
them	1
and	1
remembering	1
their	1
conversation	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
meditation	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
life	1
was	1
particularly	1
happy	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
which	1
defined	1
with	1
unfailing	1
certitude	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
This	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
covered	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
circle	1
of	1
contingencies	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
principles	1
were	1
never	1
doubtful	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
went	1
outside	1
that	1
circle	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
hesitation	1
about	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
These	1
principles	1
laid	1
down	1
as	1
invariable	1
rules	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
pay	1
a	1
cardsharper	1
but	1
need	1
not	1
pay	1
a	1
tailor	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
never	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
never	1
cheat	1
anyone	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
a	1
husband	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
never	1
pardon	1
an	1
insult	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
give	1
one	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
These	1
principles	1
were	1
possibly	1
not	1
reasonable	1
and	1
not	1
good	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
unfailing	1
certainty	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
adhered	1
to	1
them	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
Only	1
quite	1
lately	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Anna	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
his	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
did	1
not	1
fully	1
cover	1
all	1
possible	1
contingencies	1
and	1
to	1
foresee	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
difficulties	1
and	1
perplexities	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
guiding	1
clue	1
His	1
present	1
relation	1
to	1
Anna	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
It	1
was	1
clearly	1
and	1
precisely	1
defined	1
in	1
the	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
guided	1
She	1
was	1
an	1
honorable	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
bestowed	1
her	1
love	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
and	1
therefore	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
even	1
more	1
respect	1
than	1
a	1
lawful	1
wife	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
his	1
hand	1
chopped	1
off	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
allowed	1
himself	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
by	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
humiliate	1
her	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
fall	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
fullest	1
respect	1
a	1
woman	1
could	1
look	1
for	1
His	1
attitude	1
to	1
society	1
too	1
was	1
clear	1
Everyone	1
might	1
know	1
might	1
suspect	1
it	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
might	1
dare	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
If	1
any	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
force	1
all	1
who	1
might	1
speak	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
to	1
respect	1
the	1
non	1
existent	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
His	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
husband	1
was	1
the	1
clearest	1
of	1
all	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
Anna	1
loved	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
his	1
own	1
right	1
over	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
unassailable	1
Her	1
husband	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
superfluous	1
and	1
tiresome	1
person	1
No	1
doubt	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
pitiable	1
position	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
that	1
be	1
helped	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
was	1
to	1
demand	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
a	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
this	1
at	1
any	1
minute	1
But	1
of	1
late	1
new	1
inner	1
relations	1
had	1
arisen	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
which	1
frightened	1
Vronsky	1
by	1
their	1
indefiniteness	1
Only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
child	1
And	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
fact	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
called	1
for	1
something	1
not	1
fully	1
defined	1
in	1
that	1
code	1
of	1
principles	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hitherto	1
steered	1
his	1
course	1
in	1
life	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
indeed	1
caught	1
unawares	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
his	1
heart	1
had	1
prompted	1
him	1
to	1
beg	1
her	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
husband	1
He	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
but	1
now	1
thinking	1
things	1
over	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
manage	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
wrong	1
If	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
must	1
mean	1
uniting	1
her	1
life	1
with	1
mine	1
am	1
I	1
prepared	1
for	1
that	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
Supposing	1
I	1
could	1
arrange	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
while	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
If	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
is	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
And	1
he	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
The	1
question	1
whether	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
service	1
or	1
not	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
chief	1
though	1
hidden	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
of	1
which	1
none	1
knew	1
but	1
he	1
Ambition	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
dream	1
of	1
his	1
youth	1
and	1
childhood	1
a	1
dream	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
even	1
to	1
himself	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
now	1
this	1
passion	1
was	1
even	1
doing	1
battle	1
with	1
his	1
love	1
His	1
first	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
had	1
been	1
successful	1
but	1
two	1
years	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
mistake	1
Anxious	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
independence	1
and	1
to	1
advance	1
he	1
had	1
refused	1
a	1
post	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
him	1
hoping	1
that	1
this	1
refusal	1
would	1
heighten	1
his	1
value	1
but	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
bold	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
passed	1
over	1
And	1
having	1
whether	1
he	1
liked	1
or	1
not	1
taken	1
up	1
for	1
himself	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
an	1
independent	1
man	1
he	1
carried	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
great	1
tact	1
and	1
good	1
sense	1
behaving	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
bore	1
no	1
grudge	1
against	1
anyone	1
did	1
not	1
regard	1
himself	1
as	1
injured	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
and	1
cared	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
enjoying	1
himself	1
In	1
reality	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
enjoy	1
himself	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
the	1
year	1
before	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
Moscow	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
independent	1
attitude	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
anything	1
but	1
cared	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
pall	1
that	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
capable	1
of	1
anything	1
but	1
being	1
a	1
straightforward	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
His	1
connection	1
with	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
by	1
creating	1
so	1
much	1
sensation	1
and	1
attracting	1
general	1
attention	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
fresh	1
distinction	1
which	1
soothed	1
his	1
gnawing	1
worm	1
of	1
ambition	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
but	1
a	1
week	1
before	1
that	1
worm	1
had	1
been	1
roused	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
fresh	1
force	1
The	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
childhood	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
set	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
coterie	1
his	1
comrade	1
in	1
the	1
Corps	1
of	1
Pages	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
school	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
rival	1
in	1
class	1
in	1
gymnastics	1
in	1
their	1
scrapes	1
and	1
their	1
dreams	1
of	1
glory	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
from	1
Central	1
Asia	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
two	1
steps	1
up	1
in	1
rank	1
and	1
an	1
order	1
rarely	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
generals	1
so	1
young	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
arrived	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
newly	1
risen	1
star	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
magnitude	1
A	1
schoolfellow	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
and	1
was	1
expecting	1
a	1
command	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
political	1
events	1
while	1
Vronsky	1
independent	1
and	1
brilliant	1
and	1
beloved	1
by	1
a	1
charming	1
woman	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
cavalry	1
captain	1
who	1
was	1
readily	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
independent	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
liked	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
envy	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
and	1
never	1
could	1
envy	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
advancement	1
shows	1
me	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
watch	1
one	1
s	1
opportunity	1
and	1
the	1
career	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
me	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
rapidly	1
made	1
Three	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
If	1
I	1
retire	1
I	1
burn	1
my	1
ships	1
If	1
I	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
I	1
lose	1
nothing	1
She	1
said	1
herself	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
position	1
And	1
with	1
her	1
love	1
I	1
cannot	1
feel	1
envious	1
of	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
And	1
slowly	1
twirling	1
his	1
mustaches	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
His	1
eyes	1
shone	1
particularly	1
brightly	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
that	1
confident	1
calm	1
and	1
happy	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
always	1
came	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
thoroughly	1
faced	1
his	1
position	1
Everything	1
was	1
straight	1
and	1
clear	1
just	1
as	1
after	1
former	1
days	1
of	1
reckoning	1
He	1
shaved	1
took	1
a	1
cold	1
bath	1
dressed	1
and	1
went	1
out	1

smiling	1
with	1

and	1
twirling	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
mustaches	1

Vronsky	1
without	1

looked	1
at	1

thinking	1
of	1
something	1

Yes	1

at	1

said	1

The	1
smile	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
more	1
brightly	1
than	1
ever	1
Having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
that	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
his	1
ambition	1
to	1
it	1
having	1
anyway	1
taken	1
up	1
this	1
position	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
feeling	1
either	1
envious	1
of	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
or	1
hurt	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
coming	1
first	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1

Serpuhovskoy	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
friend	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
delighted	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
Ah	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
The	1
colonel	1
Demin	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
large	1
country	1
house	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
lower	1
balcony	1
In	1
the	1
courtyard	1
the	1
first	1
objects	1
that	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
singers	1
in	1
white	1
linen	1
coats	1
standing	1
near	1
a	1
barrel	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
the	1
robust	1
good	1
humored	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
surrounded	1
by	1
officers	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
of	1
the	1
balcony	1
and	1
was	1
loudly	1
shouting	1
across	1
the	1
band	1
that	1
played	1
Offenbach	1
s	1
quadrille	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
giving	1
some	1
orders	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
soldiers	1
standing	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
A	1
group	1
of	1
soldiers	1
a	1
quartermaster	1
and	1
several	1
subalterns	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
balcony	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
The	1
colonel	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
a	1
tumbler	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
proposed	1
the	1
toast	1
To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
former	1
comrade	1
the	1
gallant	1
general	1
Prince	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
Hurrah	1
The	1
colonel	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
smiling	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
You	1
always	1
get	1
younger	1
Bondarenko	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1
checked	1
smart	1
looking	1
quartermaster	1
standing	1
just	1
before	1
him	1
still	1
youngish	1
looking	1
though	1
doing	1
his	1
second	1
term	1
of	1
service	1
It	1
was	1
three	1
years	1
since	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
seen	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
He	1
looked	1
more	1
robust	1
had	1
let	1
his	1
whiskers	1
grow	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
graceful	1
creature	1
whose	1
face	1
and	1
figure	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
striking	1
from	1
their	1
softness	1
and	1
nobility	1
than	1
their	1
beauty	1
The	1
only	1
change	1
Vronsky	1
detected	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
subdued	1
continual	1
radiance	1
of	1
beaming	1
content	1
which	1
settles	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
successful	1
and	1
are	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
their	1
success	1
by	1
everyone	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
radiant	1
air	1
and	1
immediately	1
observed	1
it	1
in	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
As	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
came	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
he	1
saw	1
Vronsky	1
A	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
lighted	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
He	1
tossed	1
his	1
head	1
upwards	1
and	1
waved	1
the	1
glass	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
greeting	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
gesture	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
who	1
stood	1
craning	1
forward	1
his	1
lips	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
kissed	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
shouted	1
the	1
colonel	1
Yashvin	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
gloomy	1
tempers	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
kissed	1
the	1
moist	1
fresh	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
gallant	1
looking	1
quartermaster	1
and	1
wiping	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
said	1
squeezing	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
drawing	1
him	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
You	1
look	1
after	1
him	1
the	1
colonel	1
shouted	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
pointing	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers	1
Why	1
weren	1
t	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
yesterday	1
I	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
there	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
scrutinizing	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
I	1
did	1
go	1
but	1
late	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant	1
Please	1
have	1
this	1
divided	1
from	1
me	1
each	1
man	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
runs	1
to	1
And	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
took	1
notes	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
from	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
blushing	1
a	1
little	1
Vronsky	1
Have	1
anything	1
to	1
eat	1
or	1
drink	1
asked	1
Yashvin	1
Hi	1
something	1
for	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
eat	1
Ah	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
have	1
a	1
glass	1
The	1
f^ete	1
at	1
the	1
colonel	1
s	1
lasted	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
drinking	1
They	1
tossed	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
caught	1
him	1
again	1
several	1
times	1
Then	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
Then	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
the	1
colonel	1
himself	1
danced	1
with	1
Petritsky	1
Then	1
the	1
colonel	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
signs	1
of	1
feebleness	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
began	1
demonstrating	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
the	1
superiority	1
of	1
Russia	1
over	1
Prussia	1
especially	1
in	1
cavalry	1
attack	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lull	1
in	1
the	1
revelry	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
bathroom	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
found	1
Vronsky	1
there	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
drenching	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
water	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
sunburnt	1
hairy	1
neck	1
under	1
the	1
tap	1
and	1
was	1
rubbing	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
Vronsky	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
They	1
both	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
bathroom	1
on	1
a	1
lounge	1
and	1
a	1
conversation	1
began	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
ve	1
always	1
been	1
hearing	1
about	1
you	1
through	1
my	1
wife	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
seeing	1
her	1
pretty	1
often	1
She	1
s	1
friendly	1
with	1
Varya	1
and	1
they	1
re	1
the	1
only	1
women	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
care	1
about	1
seeing	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
He	1
smiled	1
because	1
he	1
foresaw	1
the	1
topic	1
the	1
conversation	1
would	1
turn	1
on	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
The	1
only	1
ones	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
queried	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
news	1
of	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
only	1
through	1
your	1
wife	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
checking	1
his	1
hint	1
by	1
a	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
face	1
I	1
was	1
greatly	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
success	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
surprised	1
I	1
expected	1
even	1
more	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
smiled	1
Such	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
obviously	1
agreeable	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
conceal	1
it	1
Well	1
I	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
expected	1
less	1
I	1
ll	1
own	1
frankly	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
m	1
ambitious	1
that	1
s	1
my	1
weakness	1
and	1
I	1
confess	1
to	1
it	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
confess	1
to	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
successful	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
suppose	1
so	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
smiling	1
again	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
say	1
life	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
worth	1
living	1
without	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dull	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
mistaken	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
capacity	1
for	1
the	1
line	1
I	1
ve	1
chosen	1
and	1
that	1
power	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
I	1
know	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
with	1
beaming	1
consciousness	1
of	1
success	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
nearer	1
I	1
get	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
I	1
am	1
Perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
true	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
everyone	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
too	1
but	1
here	1
I	1
live	1
and	1
think	1
life	1
worth	1
living	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
There	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
here	1
it	1
comes	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
laughing	1
Ever	1
since	1
I	1
heard	1
about	1
you	1
about	1
your	1
refusal	1
I	1
began	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
approved	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
did	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
ways	1
of	1
doing	1
everything	1
And	1
I	1
think	1
your	1
action	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
What	1
s	1
done	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
undone	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
never	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
what	1
I	1
ve	1
done	1
And	1
besides	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
well	1
off	1
Very	1
well	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
But	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
that	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
your	1
brother	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
nice	1
child	1
like	1
our	1
host	1
here	1
There	1
he	1
goes	1
he	1
added	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
hurrah	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
happy	1
but	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
satisfy	1
you	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
it	1
did	1
satisfy	1
me	1
Yes	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
Such	1
men	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
wanted	1
By	1
whom	1
By	1
whom	1
By	1
society	1
by	1
Russia	1
Russia	1
needs	1
men	1
she	1
needs	1
a	1
party	1
or	1
else	1
everything	1
goes	1
and	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
dogs	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Bertenev	1
s	1
party	1
against	1
the	1
Russian	1
communists	1
No	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
frowning	1
with	1
vexation	1
at	1
being	1
suspected	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
absurdity	1
Tout	1
ca	1
est	1
une	1
blague	1
That	1
s	1
always	1
been	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
communists	1
But	1
intriguing	1
people	1
have	1
to	1
invent	1
a	1
noxious	1
dangerous	1
party	1
It	1
s	1
an	1
old	1
trick	1
No	1
what	1
s	1
wanted	1
is	1
a	1
powerful	1
party	1
of	1
independent	1
men	1
like	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
But	1
why	1
so	1
Vronsky	1
mentioned	1
a	1
few	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
power	1
Why	1
aren	1
t	1
they	1
independent	1
men	1
Simply	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
or	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
from	1
birth	1
an	1
independent	1
fortune	1
they	1
ve	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
they	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
center	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
bought	1
either	1
by	1
money	1
or	1
by	1
favor	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
support	1
for	1
themselves	1
in	1
inventing	1
a	1
policy	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
forward	1
some	1
notion	1
some	1
policy	1
that	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
that	1
does	1
harm	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
policy	1
is	1
really	1
only	1
a	1
means	1
to	1
a	1
government	1
house	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
income	1
Cela	1

when	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
peep	1
at	1
their	1
cards	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
inferior	1
to	1
them	1
stupider	1
perhaps	1
though	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
inferior	1
to	1
them	1
But	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
important	1
advantage	1
over	1
them	1
for	1
certain	1
in	1
being	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
buy	1
And	1
such	1
men	1
are	1
more	1
needed	1
than	1
ever	1
Vronsky	1
listened	1
attentively	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
contemplating	1
a	1
struggle	1
with	1
the	1
existing	1
powers	1
and	1
already	1
had	1
his	1
likes	1
and	1
dislikes	1
in	1
that	1
higher	1
world	1
while	1
his	1
own	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
governing	1
world	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
too	1
how	1
powerful	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
might	1
become	1
through	1
his	1
unmistakable	1
faculty	1
for	1
thinking	1
things	1
out	1
and	1
for	1
taking	1
things	1
in	1
through	1
his	1
intelligence	1
and	1
gift	1
of	1
words	1
so	1
rarely	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
And	1
ashamed	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
felt	1
envious	1
Still	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
most	1
importance	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
answered	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
desire	1
for	1
power	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
once	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
gone	1
Excuse	1
me	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
now	1
Vronsky	1
added	1
to	1
be	1
truthful	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
now	1
that	1
s	1
another	1
thing	1
but	1
that	1
now	1
won	1
t	1
last	1
forever	1
Perhaps	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
You	1
say	1
perhaps	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
though	1
guessing	1
his	1
thoughts	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
for	1
certain	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
for	1
Your	1
action	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
but	1
you	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
I	1
only	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
protection	1
though	1
indeed	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
I	1
protect	1
you	1
you	1
ve	1
protected	1
me	1
often	1
enough	1
I	1
should	1
hope	1
our	1
friendship	1
rises	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
Yes	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
tenderly	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
draw	1
you	1
upwards	1
imperceptibly	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
except	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
facing	1
him	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
understand	1
what	1
that	1
means	1
But	1
listen	1
we	1
re	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
you	1
ve	1
known	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
women	1
perhaps	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
Serpohovskoy	1
s	1
smile	1
and	1
gestures	1
told	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
afraid	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
tender	1
and	1
careful	1
in	1
touching	1
the	1
sore	1
place	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
married	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
in	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
thoroughly	1
one	1
s	1
wife	1
if	1
one	1
loves	1
her	1
as	1
someone	1
has	1
said	1
one	1
gets	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
women	1
better	1
than	1
if	1
one	1
knew	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
We	1
re	1
coming	1
directly	1
Vronsky	1
shouted	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
longing	1
now	1
to	1
hear	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
Serpuhovskey	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
And	1
here	1
s	1
my	1
opinion	1
for	1
you	1
Women	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
stumbling	1
block	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
career	1
It	1
s	1
hard	1
to	1
love	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
do	1
anything	1
There	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
having	1
love	1
conveniently	1
without	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
hindrance	1
that	1
s	1
marriage	1
How	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
said	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
liked	1
similes	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
Yes	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
carry	1
a	1
fardeau	1
and	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
your	1
hands	1
when	1
the	1
fardeau	1
is	1
tied	1
on	1
your	1
back	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
marriage	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
married	1
My	1
hands	1
were	1
suddenly	1
set	1
free	1
But	1
to	1
drag	1
that	1
fardeau	1
about	1
with	1
you	1
without	1
marriage	1
your	1
hands	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
so	1
full	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
Look	1
at	1
Mazankov	1
at	1
Krupov	1
They	1
ve	1
ruined	1
their	1
careers	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
women	1
What	1
women	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
recalling	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
and	1
the	1
actress	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
mentioned	1
were	1
connected	1
The	1
firmer	1
the	1
woman	1
s	1
footing	1
in	1
society	1
the	1
worse	1
it	1
is	1
That	1
s	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
not	1
merely	1
carrying	1
the	1
fardeau	1
in	1
your	1
arms	1
but	1
tearing	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
someone	1
else	1
You	1
have	1
never	1
loved	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
softly	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
Anna	1
Perhaps	1
But	1
you	1
remember	1
what	1
I	1
ve	1
said	1
to	1
you	1
And	1
another	1
thing	1
women	1
are	1
all	1
more	1
materialistic	1
than	1
men	1
We	1
make	1
something	1
immense	1
out	1
of	1
love	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
terre	1

Directly	1
directly	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
a	1
footman	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
But	1
the	1
footman	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
again	1
as	1
he	1
supposed	1
The	1
footman	1
brought	1
Vronsky	1
a	1
note	1
A	1
man	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
Vronsky	1
opened	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
My	1
head	1
s	1
begun	1
to	1
ache	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
home	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
Oh	1
good	1
bye	1
then	1
You	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
	1
We	1
ll	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
later	1
on	1
I	1
ll	1
look	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Chapter	1
22	1
It	1
was	1
six	1
o	1
clock	1
already	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
quickly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
not	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
known	1
to	1
everyone	1
Vronsky	1
got	1
into	1
Yashvin	1
s	1
hired	1
fly	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
drive	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
roomy	1
old	1
fashioned	1
fly	1
with	1
seats	1
for	1
four	1
He	1
sat	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
stretched	1
his	1
legs	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
seat	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
meditation	1
A	1
vague	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
affairs	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
a	1
vague	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
friendliness	1
and	1
flattery	1
of	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
had	1
considered	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
needed	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
before	1
him	1
all	1
blended	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
joyous	1
sense	1
of	1
life	1
This	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
He	1
dropped	1
his	1
legs	1
crossed	1
one	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
knee	1
and	1
taking	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
felt	1
the	1
springy	1
muscle	1
of	1
the	1
calf	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
grazed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
by	1
his	1
fall	1
and	1
leaning	1
back	1
he	1
drew	1
several	1
deep	1
breaths	1
I	1
m	1
happy	1
very	1
happy	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
before	1
had	1
this	1
sense	1
of	1
physical	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
He	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
slight	1
ache	1
in	1
his	1
strong	1
leg	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
muscular	1
sensation	1
of	1
movement	1
in	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
he	1
breathed	1
The	1
bright	1
cold	1
August	1
day	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
Anna	1
feel	1
so	1
hopeless	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
keenly	1
stimulating	1
and	1
refreshed	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
that	1
still	1
tingled	1
from	1
the	1
cold	1
water	1
The	1
scent	1
of	1
brilliantine	1
on	1
his	1
whiskers	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
in	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
Everything	1
he	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
window	1
everything	1
in	1
that	1
cold	1
pure	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
pale	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sunset	1
was	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
gay	1
and	1
strong	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
shining	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
the	1
sharp	1
outlines	1
of	1
fences	1
and	1
angles	1
of	1
buildings	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
passers	1
by	1
the	1
carriages	1
that	1
met	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
motionless	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
grass	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
evenly	1
drawn	1
furrows	1
of	1
potatoes	1
and	1
the	1
slanting	1
shadows	1
that	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
houses	1
and	1
trees	1
and	1
bushes	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
potatoes	1
everything	1
was	1
bright	1
like	1
a	1
pretty	1
landscape	1
just	1
finished	1
and	1
freshly	1
varnished	1
Get	1
on	1
get	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pulling	1
a	1
three	1
rouble	1
note	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
The	1
driver	1
s	1
hand	1
fumbled	1
with	1
something	1
at	1
the	1
lamp	1
the	1
whip	1
cracked	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
rolled	1
rapidly	1
along	1
the	1
smooth	1
highroad	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
but	1
this	1
happiness	1
he	1
thought	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
bone	1
button	1
of	1
the	1
bell	1
in	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
picturing	1
to	1
himself	1
Anna	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
last	1
time	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
go	1
on	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
Here	1
s	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
Vrede	1
Villa	1
Whereabouts	1
will	1
she	1
be	1
Where	1
How	1
Why	1
did	1
she	1
fix	1
on	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
and	1
why	1
does	1
she	1
write	1
in	1
Betsy	1
s	1
letter	1
he	1
thought	1
wondering	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
it	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
wonder	1
He	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
stop	1
before	1
reaching	1
the	1
avenue	1
and	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
moving	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
avenue	1
that	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
avenue	1
but	1
looking	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
hidden	1
by	1
a	1
veil	1
but	1
he	1
drank	1
in	1
with	1
glad	1
eyes	1
the	1
special	1
movement	1
in	1
walking	1
peculiar	1
to	1
her	1
alone	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
electric	1
shock	1
ran	1
all	1
over	1
him	1
With	1
fresh	1
force	1
he	1
felt	1
conscious	1
of	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
springy	1
motions	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
to	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
his	1
lungs	1
as	1
he	1
breathed	1
and	1
something	1
set	1
his	1
lips	1
twitching	1
Joining	1
him	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
tightly	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
angry	1
that	1
I	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
absolutely	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
serious	1
and	1
set	1
line	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
veil	1
transformed	1
his	1
mood	1
at	1
once	1
I	1
angry	1
But	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
where	1
from	1
Never	1
mind	1
she	1
said	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
come	1
along	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
interview	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
joyous	1
one	1
In	1
her	1
presence	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
without	1
knowing	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
her	1
distress	1
he	1
already	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
distress	1
unconsciously	1
passing	1
over	1
him	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
read	1
her	1
thoughts	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
walked	1
on	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
in	1
silence	1
gathering	1
up	1
her	1
courage	1
then	1
suddenly	1
she	1
stopped	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
yesterday	1
she	1
began	1
breathing	1
quickly	1
and	1
painfully	1
that	1
coming	1
home	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
told	1
him	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
He	1
heard	1
her	1
unconsciously	1
bending	1
his	1
whole	1
figure	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
hoping	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
for	1
her	1
But	1
directly	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
suddenly	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
hard	1
expression	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
Yes	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
better	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
better	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
painful	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
said	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
she	1
was	1
reading	1
his	1
thoughts	1
from	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
that	1
that	1
expression	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
idea	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
a	1
duel	1
was	1
now	1
inevitable	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
duel	1
had	1
never	1
crossed	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
put	1
a	1
different	1
interpretation	1
on	1
this	1
passing	1
expression	1
of	1
hardness	1
When	1
she	1
got	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
letter	1
she	1
knew	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
to	1
forego	1
her	1
position	1
to	1
abandon	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
lover	1
The	1
morning	1
spent	1
at	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
had	1
confirmed	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
But	1
this	1
interview	1
was	1
still	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
gravity	1
for	1
her	1
She	1
hoped	1
that	1
this	1
interview	1
would	1
transform	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
save	1
her	1
If	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
news	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
resolutely	1
passionately	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
wavering	1
Throw	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
But	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
not	1
produced	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
in	1
him	1
he	1
simply	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
resenting	1
some	1
affront	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
painful	1
to	1
me	1
It	1
happened	1
of	1
itself	1
she	1
said	1
irritably	1
and	1
see	1
she	1
pulled	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
letter	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
glove	1
I	1
understand	1
I	1
understand	1
he	1
interrupted	1
her	1
taking	1
the	1
letter	1
but	1
not	1
reading	1
it	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
longed	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
prayed	1
for	1
was	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
this	1
position	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
devote	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
your	1
happiness	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
can	1
doubt	1
it	1
If	1
I	1
doubted	1
Who	1
s	1
that	1
coming	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
suddenly	1
pointing	1
to	1
two	1
ladies	1
walking	1
towards	1
them	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
know	1
us	1
and	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
turned	1
off	1
drawing	1
her	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
side	1
path	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
she	1
said	1
Her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
And	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
looked	1
with	1
strange	1
fury	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
veil	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
doubt	1
that	1
but	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
writes	1
to	1
me	1
Read	1
it	1
She	1
stood	1
still	1
again	1
Again	1
just	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
hearing	1
of	1
her	1
rupture	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
Vronsky	1
on	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
unconsciously	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
natural	1
sensation	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
betrayed	1
husband	1
Now	1
while	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
picturing	1
the	1
challenge	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
most	1
likely	1
find	1
at	1
home	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
the	1
duel	1
itself	1
in	1
which	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cold	1
and	1
haughty	1
expression	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
assuming	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
he	1
would	1
await	1
the	1
injured	1
husband	1
s	1
shot	1
after	1
having	1
himself	1
fired	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
there	1
flashed	1
across	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
been	1
thinking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
bind	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
Having	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
determination	1
in	1
them	1
She	1
saw	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
before	1
by	1
himself	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
her	1
last	1
hope	1
had	1
failed	1
her	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
reckoning	1
on	1
You	1
see	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
he	1
Forgive	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
rejoice	1
at	1
it	1
Vronsky	1
interrupted	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
finish	1
he	1
added	1
his	1
eyes	1
imploring	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
words	1
I	1
rejoice	1
because	1
things	1
cannot	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
remain	1
as	1
he	1
supposes	1
Why	1
can	1
t	1
they	1
Anna	1
said	1
restraining	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
obviously	1
attaching	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
consequence	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
was	1
sealed	1
Vronsky	1
meant	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
duel	1
inevitable	1
he	1
thought	1
things	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
as	1
before	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
different	1
It	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
now	1
you	1
will	1
leave	1
him	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
was	1
confused	1
and	1
reddened	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
arrange	1
and	1
plan	1
our	1
life	1
Tomorrow	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
But	1
my	1
child	1
she	1
shrieked	1
You	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
writes	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
that	1
But	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
leave	1
your	1
child	1
or	1
keep	1
up	1
this	1
degrading	1
position	1
To	1
whom	1
is	1
it	1
degrading	1
To	1
all	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
you	1
You	1
say	1
degrading	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
Those	1
words	1
have	1
no	1
meaning	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
now	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
was	1
untrue	1
She	1
had	1
nothing	1
left	1
her	1
but	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
loved	1
you	1
everything	1
has	1
changed	1
for	1
me	1
For	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
one	1
thing	1
only	1
your	1
love	1
If	1
that	1
s	1
mine	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
exalted	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
humiliating	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
proud	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
because	1
proud	1
of	1
being	1
proud	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
Tears	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
despair	1
choked	1
her	1
utterance	1
She	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
sobbed	1
He	1
felt	1
too	1
something	1
swelling	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
twitching	1
in	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
weeping	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
touched	1
him	1
so	1
He	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
her	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
something	1
wrong	1
Is	1
not	1
a	1
divorce	1
possible	1
he	1
said	1
feebly	1
She	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
not	1
answering	1
Couldn	1
t	1
you	1
take	1
your	1
son	1
and	1
still	1
leave	1
him	1
Yes	1
but	1
it	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
him	1
Now	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
shortly	1
Her	1
presentiment	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
again	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way	1
had	1
not	1
deceived	1
her	1
On	1
Tuesday	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
everything	1
can	1
be	1
settled	1
Yes	1
she	1
said	1
But	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1

23	1
On	1
Monday	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
usual	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
Commission	1
of	1
the	1
2nd	1
of	1
June	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
the	1
sitting	1
was	1
held	1
greeted	1
the	1
members	1
and	1
the	1
president	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
papers	1
laid	1
ready	1
before	1
him	1
Among	1
these	1
papers	1
lay	1
the	1
necessary	1
evidence	1
and	1
a	1
rough	1
outline	1
of	1
the	1
speech	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
make	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
need	1
these	1
documents	1
He	1
remembered	1
every	1
point	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
enemy	1
facing	1
him	1
and	1
studiously	1
endeavoring	1
to	1
assume	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
indifference	1
his	1
speech	1
would	1
flow	1
of	1
itself	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
prepare	1
it	1
now	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
was	1
of	1
such	1
magnitude	1
that	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
weight	1
Meantime	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
report	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
most	1
innocent	1
and	1
inoffensive	1
air	1
No	1
one	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
white	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
swollen	1
veins	1
and	1
long	1
fingers	1
so	1
softly	1
stroking	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
paper	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
weariness	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
head	1
drooped	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
would	1
have	1
suspected	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
words	1
would	1
flow	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
would	1
arouse	1
a	1
fearful	1
storm	1
set	1
the	1
members	1
shouting	1
and	1
attacking	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
force	1
the	1
president	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
order	1
When	1
the	1
report	1
was	1
over	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
announced	1
in	1
his	1
subdued	1
delicate	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
points	1
to	1
bring	1
before	1
the	1
meeting	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
Commission	1
for	1
the	1
Reorganization	1
of	1
the	1
Native	1
Tribes	1
All	1
attention	1
was	1
turned	1
upon	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
opponent	1
but	1
selecting	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
delivering	1
his	1
speeches	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him	1
an	1
inoffensive	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
in	1
the	1
Commission	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
views	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
point	1
about	1
the	1
fundamental	1
and	1
radical	1
law	1
his	1
opponent	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
protest	1
Stremov	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Commission	1
and	1
also	1
stung	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
began	1
defending	1
himself	1
and	1
altogether	1
a	1
stormy	1
sitting	1
followed	1
but	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
triumphed	1
and	1
his	1
motion	1
was	1
carried	1
three	1
new	1
commissions	1
were	1
appointed	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
Petersburg	1
circle	1
nothing	1
else	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
but	1
this	1
sitting	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
success	1
had	1
been	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
anticipated	1
Next	1
morning	1
Tuesday	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
on	1
waking	1
up	1
recollected	1
with	1
pleasure	1
his	1
triumph	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
though	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
indifferent	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
anxious	1
to	1
flatter	1
him	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
rumors	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
concerning	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
Commission	1
Absorbed	1
in	1
business	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Tuesday	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
received	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
annoyance	1
when	1
a	1
servant	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
arrival	1
Anna	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
her	1
telegram	1
and	1
so	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
of	1
her	1
arrival	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
arrived	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
meet	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
gone	1
out	1
but	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
secretary	1
She	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
occupied	1
herself	1
in	1
sorting	1
out	1
her	1
things	1
expecting	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
an	1
hour	1
passed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
She	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
giving	1
some	1
directions	1
and	1
spoke	1
loudly	1
on	1
purpose	1
expecting	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
there	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
though	1
she	1
heard	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
study	1
as	1
he	1
parted	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
usually	1
went	1
out	1
quickly	1
to	1
his	1
office	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
that	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
attitude	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
might	1
be	1
defined	1
She	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
resolutely	1
to	1
him	1
When	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
official	1
uniform	1
obviously	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
rested	1
his	1
elbows	1
looking	1
dejectedly	1
before	1
him	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
On	1
seeing	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
risen	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
then	1
his	1
face	1
flushed	1
hotly	1
a	1
thing	1
Anna	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
above	1
them	1
at	1
her	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
obviously	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
stuttered	1
Several	1
times	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
stopped	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
meeting	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
schooled	1
herself	1
to	1
despise	1
and	1
reproach	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
silence	1
lasted	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
Is	1
Seryozha	1
quite	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
he	1
added	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
today	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
directly	1
I	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Moscow	1
she	1
said	1
No	1
you	1
did	1
quite	1
quite	1
right	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
again	1
Seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
powerless	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
began	1
herself	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes	1
under	1
his	1
persistent	1
gaze	1
at	1
her	1
hair	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
guilty	1
woman	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
bad	1
woman	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
then	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
change	1
nothing	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
no	1
question	1
about	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
resolutely	1
and	1
with	1
hatred	1
looking	1
her	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
that	1
was	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
supposed	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
anger	1
he	1
apparently	1
regained	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
faculties	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
then	1
and	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
shrill	1
voice	1
I	1
repeat	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
I	1
ignore	1
it	1
Not	1
all	1
wives	1
are	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
communicate	1
such	1
agreeable	1
news	1
to	1
their	1
husbands	1
He	1
laid	1
special	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
agreeable	1
I	1
shall	1
ignore	1
it	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
not	1
disgraced	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
simply	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
our	1
relations	1
must	1
be	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
and	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
your	1
compromising	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
steps	1
to	1
secure	1
my	1
honor	1
But	1
our	1
relations	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
always	1
Anna	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
timid	1
voice	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
dismay	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
once	1
more	1
those	1
composed	1
gestures	1
heard	1
that	1
shrill	1
childish	1
and	1
sarcastic	1
voice	1
her	1
aversion	1
for	1
him	1
extinguished	1
her	1
pity	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
only	1
afraid	1
but	1
at	1
all	1
costs	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
make	1
clear	1
her	1
position	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
your	1
wife	1
while	1
I	1
she	1
began	1
He	1
laughed	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
malignant	1
laugh	1
The	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
you	1
have	1
chosen	1
is	1
reflected	1
I	1
suppose	1
in	1
your	1
ideas	1
I	1
have	1
too	1
much	1
respect	1
or	1
contempt	1
or	1
both	1
I	1
respect	1
your	1
past	1
and	1
despise	1
your	1
present	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
interpretation	1
you	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
words	1
Anna	1
sighed	1
and	1
bowed	1
her	1
head	1
Though	1
indeed	1
I	1
fail	1
to	1
comprehend	1
how	1
with	1
the	1
independence	1
you	1
show	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
getting	1
hot	1
announcing	1
your	1
infidelity	1
to	1
your	1
husband	1
and	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
it	1
apparently	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
anything	1
reprehensible	1
in	1
performing	1
a	1
wife	1
s	1
duties	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
your	1
husband	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
meet	1
that	1
man	1
here	1
and	1
to	1
conduct	1
yourself	1
so	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
world	1
nor	1
the	1
servants	1
can	1
reproach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
That	1
s	1
not	1
much	1
I	1
think	1
And	1
in	1
return	1
you	1
will	1
enjoy	1
all	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
a	1
faithful	1
wife	1
without	1
fulfilling	1
her	1
duties	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
Now	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
Anna	1
got	1
up	1
too	1
Bowing	1
in	1
silence	1
he	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
before	1
him	1
Chapter	1
24	1
The	1
night	1
spent	1
by	1
Levin	1
on	1
the	1
haycock	1
did	1
not	1
pass	1
without	1
result	1
for	1
him	1
The	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
managing	1
his	1
land	1
revolted	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
attraction	1
for	1
him	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
magnificent	1
harvest	1
never	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
never	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
hindrances	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
quarrels	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
as	1
that	1
year	1
and	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
these	1
failures	1
and	1
this	1
hostility	1
was	1
now	1
perfectly	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
delight	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
itself	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
greater	1
intimacy	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
envy	1
he	1
felt	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
life	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
adopt	1
that	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
night	1
not	1
a	1
dream	1
but	1
an	1
intention	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
out	1
in	1
detail	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
so	1
transformed	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
managed	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
former	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
that	1
unpleasant	1
relation	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
workpeople	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
The	1
herd	1
of	1
improved	1
cows	1
such	1
as	1
Pava	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
ploughed	1
over	1
and	1
enriched	1
the	1
nine	1
level	1
fields	1
surrounded	1
with	1
hedges	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
acres	1
heavily	1
manured	1
the	1
seed	1
sown	1
in	1
drills	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
splendid	1
if	1
only	1
the	1
work	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
for	1
themselves	1
or	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
comrades	1
people	1
in	1
sympathy	1
with	1
them	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
now	1
his	1
work	1
on	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
in	1
husbandry	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
laborer	1
greatly	1
assisted	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
farming	1
he	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
stubborn	1
struggle	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
laborers	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
his	1
side	1
a	1
continual	1
intense	1
effort	1
to	1
change	1
everything	1
to	1
a	1
pattern	1
he	1
considered	1
better	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
the	1
natural	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
struggle	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
with	1
immense	1
expenditure	1
of	1
force	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
effort	1
or	1
even	1
intention	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
attained	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
liking	1
of	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
splendid	1
tools	1
splendid	1
cattle	1
and	1
land	1
were	1
spoiled	1
with	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
anyone	1
Worst	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
energy	1
expended	1
on	1
this	1
work	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
wasted	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
now	1
since	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
system	1
had	1
become	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
his	1
energy	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
unworthy	1
one	1
In	1
reality	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
struggle	1
about	1
He	1
was	1
struggling	1
for	1
every	1
farthing	1
of	1
his	1
share	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
it	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
relax	1
his	1
efforts	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
laborers	1
wages	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
struggling	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
work	1
easily	1
and	1
agreeably	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
used	1
to	1
doing	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
for	1
his	1
interests	1
that	1
every	1
laborer	1
should	1
work	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
that	1
while	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
should	1
keep	1
his	1
wits	1
about	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
winnowing	1
machines	1
the	1
horse	1
rakes	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machines	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
attend	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
What	1
the	1
laborer	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
work	1
as	1
pleasantly	1
as	1
possible	1
with	1
rests	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
carelessly	1
and	1
heedlessly	1
without	1
thinking	1
That	1
summer	1
Levin	1
saw	1
this	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
He	1
sent	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
mow	1
some	1
clover	1
for	1
hay	1
picking	1
out	1
the	1
worst	1
patches	1
where	1
the	1
clover	1
was	1
overgrown	1
with	1
grass	1
and	1
weeds	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
for	1
seed	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
they	1
mowed	1
the	1
best	1
acres	1
of	1
clover	1
justifying	1
themselves	1
by	1
the	1
pretense	1
that	1
the	1
bailiff	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
pacify	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
assurance	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
splendid	1
hay	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
those	1
acres	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
easier	1
to	1
mow	1
He	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
hay	1
machine	1
for	1
pitching	1
the	1
hay	1
it	1
was	1
broken	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
dull	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
peasant	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
wings	1
waving	1
above	1
him	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
Don	1
t	1
trouble	1
your	1
honor	1
sure	1
the	1
womenfolks	1
will	1
pitch	1
it	1
quick	1
enough	1
The	1
ploughs	1
were	1
practically	1
useless	1
because	1
it	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
laborer	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
share	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
plough	1
and	1
forcing	1
it	1
round	1
he	1
strained	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
tore	1
up	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
begged	1
not	1
to	1
mind	1
about	1
it	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
stray	1
into	1
the	1
wheat	1
because	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
laborer	1
would	1
consent	1
to	1
be	1
night	1
watchman	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
laborers	1
insisted	1
on	1
taking	1
turns	1
for	1
night	1
duty	1
and	1
Ivan	1
after	1
working	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
penitent	1
for	1
his	1
fault	1
saying	1
Do	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
to	1
me	1
your	1
honor	1
They	1
killed	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
calves	1
by	1
letting	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
clover	1
aftermath	1
without	1
care	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
drinking	1
and	1
nothing	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
men	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
blown	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
clover	1
but	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
consolation	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
neighbors	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twelve	1
head	1
of	1
cattle	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
All	1
this	1
happened	1
not	1
because	1
anyone	1
felt	1
ill	1
will	1
to	1
Levin	1
or	1
his	1
farm	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
liked	1
him	1
thought	1
him	1
a	1
simple	1
gentleman	1
their	1
highest	1
praise	1
but	1
it	1
happened	1
simply	1
because	1
all	1
they	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
work	1
merrily	1
and	1
carelessly	1
and	1
his	1
interests	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
remote	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
fatally	1
opposed	1
to	1
their	1
most	1
just	1
claims	1
Long	1
before	1
Levin	1
had	1
felt	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
He	1
saw	1
where	1
his	1
boat	1
leaked	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
leak	1
perhaps	1
purposely	1
deceiving	1
himself	1
Nothing	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
lost	1
faith	1
in	1
it	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
could	1
deceive	1
himself	1
no	1
longer	1
The	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
managing	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
not	1
merely	1
unattractive	1
but	1
revolting	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
take	1
no	1
further	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
To	1
this	1
now	1
was	1
joined	1
the	1
presence	1
only	1
twenty	1
five	1
miles	1
off	1
of	1
Kitty	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
whom	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Oblonskaya	1
had	1
invited	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
over	1
there	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
renewing	1
his	1
offer	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
who	1
would	1
so	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
understand	1
accept	1
him	1
now	1
Levin	1
himself	1
had	1
felt	1
on	1
seeing	1
Kitty	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
knowing	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
him	1
had	1
placed	1
an	1
insuperable	1
barrier	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
him	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
wife	1
merely	1
because	1
she	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
marry	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
made	1
him	1
cold	1
and	1
hostile	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
reproach	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
resentment	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
only	1
hate	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
she	1
s	1
bound	1
to	1
And	1
besides	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
now	1
after	1
what	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
told	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
Can	1
I	1
help	1
showing	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
And	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
magnanimously	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
and	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
Me	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
performance	1
before	1
her	1
of	1
forgiving	1
and	1
deigning	1
to	1
bestow	1
my	1
love	1
on	1
her	1
What	1
induced	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
By	1
chance	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
then	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
happened	1
of	1
itself	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
asking	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
side	1
saddle	1
for	1
Kitty	1
s	1
use	1
I	1
m	1
told	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
side	1
saddle	1
she	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
over	1
yourself	1
This	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
stand	1
How	1
could	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
any	1
intelligence	1
of	1
any	1
delicacy	1
put	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
humiliating	1
position	1
He	1
wrote	1
ten	1
notes	1
and	1
tore	1
them	1
all	1
up	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
saddle	1
without	1
any	1
reply	1
To	1
write	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
was	1
impossible	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
write	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
because	1
something	1
prevented	1
him	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
away	1
that	1
was	1
still	1
worse	1
He	1
sent	1
the	1
saddle	1
without	1
an	1
answer	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
having	1
done	1
something	1
shameful	1
he	1
handed	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
now	1
revolting	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
to	1
the	1
bailiff	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
a	1
remote	1
district	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
friend	1
Sviazhsky	1
who	1
had	1
splendid	1
marshes	1
for	1
grouse	1
in	1
his	1
neighborhood	1
and	1
had	1
lately	1
written	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
long	1
standing	1
promise	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
him	1
The	1
grouse	1
marsh	1
in	1
the	1
Surovsky	1
district	1
had	1
long	1
tempted	1
Levin	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
continually	1
put	1
off	1
this	1
visit	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
his	1
farm	1
work	1
especially	1
on	1
a	1
shooting	1
expedition	1
which	1
always	1
in	1
trouble	1
served	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
consolation	1
Chapter	1
25	1
In	1
the	1
Surovsky	1
district	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
railway	1
nor	1
service	1
of	1
post	1
horses	1
and	1
Levin	1
drove	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
in	1
his	1
big	1
old	1
fashioned	1
carriage	1
He	1
stopped	1
halfway	1
at	1
a	1
well	1
to	1
do	1
peasant	1
s	1
to	1
feed	1
his	1
horses	1
A	1
bald	1
well	1
preserved	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
red	1
beard	1
gray	1
on	1
his	1
cheeks	1
opened	1
the	1
gate	1
squeezing	1
against	1
the	1
gatepost	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
three	1
horses	1
pass	1
Directing	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
under	1
the	1
shed	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
clean	1
tidy	1
yard	1
with	1
charred	1
old	1
fashioned	1
ploughs	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
asked	1
Levin	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
parlor	1
A	1
cleanly	1
dressed	1
young	1
woman	1
with	1
clogs	1
on	1
her	1
bare	1
feet	1
was	1
scrubbing	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
outer	1
room	1
She	1
was	1
frightened	1
of	1
the	1
dog	1
that	1
ran	1
in	1
after	1
Levin	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
shriek	1
but	1
began	1
laughing	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
fright	1
at	1
once	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
dog	1
would	1
not	1
hurt	1
her	1
Pointing	1
Levin	1
with	1
her	1
bare	1
arm	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
parlor	1
she	1
bent	1
down	1
again	1
hiding	1
her	1
handsome	1
face	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
scrubbing	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
samovar	1
she	1
asked	1
Yes	1
please	1
The	1
parlor	1
was	1
a	1
big	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
Dutch	1
stove	1
and	1
a	1
screen	1
dividing	1
it	1
into	1
two	1
Under	1
the	1
holy	1
pictures	1
stood	1
a	1
table	1
painted	1
in	1
patterns	1
a	1
bench	1
and	1
two	1
chairs	1
Near	1
the	1
entrance	1
was	1
a	1
dresser	1
full	1
of	1
crockery	1
The	1
shutters	1
were	1
closed	1
there	1
were	1
few	1
flies	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
clean	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
anxious	1
that	1
Laska	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
running	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
bathing	1
in	1
puddles	1
should	1
not	1
muddy	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
ordered	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
After	1
looking	1
round	1
the	1
parlor	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
yard	1
The	1
good	1
looking	1
young	1
woman	1
in	1
clogs	1
swinging	1
the	1
empty	1
pails	1
on	1
the	1
yoke	1
ran	1
on	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
well	1
for	1
water	1
Look	1
sharp	1
my	1
girl	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
shouted	1
after	1
her	1
good	1
humoredly	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Levin	1
Well	1
sir	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanovitch	1
Sviazhsky	1
His	1
honor	1
comes	1
to	1
us	1
too	1
he	1
began	1
chatting	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
railing	1
of	1
the	1
steps	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Sviazhsky	1
the	1
gates	1
creaked	1
again	1
and	1
laborers	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
from	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
wooden	1
ploughs	1
and	1
harrows	1
The	1
horses	1
harnessed	1
to	1
the	1
ploughs	1
and	1
harrows	1
were	1
sleek	1
and	1
fat	1
The	1
laborers	1
were	1
obviously	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
two	1
were	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
cotton	1
shirts	1
and	1
caps	1
the	1
two	1
others	1
were	1
hired	1
laborers	1
in	1
homespun	1
shirts	1
one	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
Moving	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
steps	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
began	1
unharnessing	1
them	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
ploughing	1
asked	1
Levin	1
Ploughing	1
up	1
the	1
potatoes	1
We	1
rent	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
land	1
too	1
Fedot	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
out	1
the	1
gelding	1
but	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
trough	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
put	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
harness	1
Oh	1
father	1
the	1
ploughshares	1
I	1
ordered	1
has	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
along	1
asked	1
the	1
big	1
healthy	1
looking	1
fellow	1
obviously	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
son	1
There	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
room	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
bundling	1
together	1
the	1
harness	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
and	1
flinging	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
You	1
can	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
while	1
they	1
have	1
dinner	1
The	1
good	1
looking	1
young	1
woman	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
outer	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
pails	1
dragging	1
at	1
her	1
shoulders	1
More	1
women	1
came	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
from	1
somewhere	1
young	1
and	1
handsome	1
middle	1
aged	1
old	1
and	1
ugly	1
with	1
children	1
and	1
without	1
children	1
The	1
samovar	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
sing	1
the	1
laborers	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
having	1
disposed	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
Levin	1
getting	1
his	1
provisions	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
invited	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
take	1
tea	1
with	1
him	1
Well	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
today	1
already	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
obviously	1
accepting	1
the	1
invitation	1
with	1
pleasure	1
But	1
just	1
a	1
glass	1
for	1
company	1
Over	1
their	1
tea	1
Levin	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
farming	1
Ten	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
rented	1
three	1
hundred	1
acres	1
from	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
owned	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
them	1
and	1
rented	1
another	1
three	1
hundred	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
landowner	1
A	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
the	1
worst	1
part	1
he	1
let	1
out	1
for	1
rent	1
while	1
a	1
hundred	1
acres	1
of	1
arable	1
land	1
he	1
cultivated	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
two	1
hired	1
laborers	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
complained	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
doing	1
badly	1
But	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
simply	1
did	1
so	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
propriety	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
farm	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
flourishing	1
condition	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
unsuccessful	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
bought	1
land	1
at	1
thirty	1
five	1
roubles	1
the	1
acre	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
married	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
and	1
a	1
nephew	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
rebuilt	1
twice	1
after	1
fires	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
on	1
a	1
larger	1
scale	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
complaints	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
proud	1
and	1
justly	1
proud	1
of	1
his	1
prosperity	1
proud	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
his	1
nephew	1
his	1
sons	1
wives	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
his	1
cows	1
and	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
keeping	1
all	1
this	1
farming	1
going	1
From	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Levin	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
averse	1
to	1
new	1
methods	1
either	1
He	1
had	1
planted	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
potatoes	1
and	1
his	1
potatoes	1
as	1
Levin	1
had	1
seen	1
driving	1
past	1
were	1
already	1
past	1
flowering	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
die	1
down	1
while	1
Levin	1
s	1
were	1
only	1
just	1
coming	1
into	1
flower	1
He	1
earthed	1
up	1
his	1
potatoes	1
with	1
a	1
modern	1
plough	1
borrowed	1
from	1
a	1
neighboring	1
landowner	1
He	1
sowed	1
wheat	1
The	1
trifling	1
fact	1
that	1
thinning	1
out	1
his	1
rye	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
used	1
the	1
rye	1
he	1
thinned	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
horses	1
specially	1
struck	1
Levin	1
How	1
many	1
times	1
had	1
Levin	1
seen	1
this	1
splendid	1
fodder	1
wasted	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
saved	1
but	1
always	1
it	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
impossible	1
The	1
peasant	1
got	1
this	1
done	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
enough	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
What	1
have	1
the	1
wenches	1
to	1
do	1
They	1
carry	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
bundles	1
to	1
the	1
roadside	1
and	1
the	1
cart	1
brings	1
it	1
away	1
Well	1
we	1
landowners	1
can	1
t	1
manage	1
well	1
with	1
our	1
laborers	1
said	1
Levin	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
tea	1
Thank	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
but	1
refused	1
sugar	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
lump	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
They	1
re	1
simple	1
destruction	1
said	1
he	1
Look	1
at	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
for	1
instance	1
We	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
s	1
like	1
first	1
rate	1
yet	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
crop	1
to	1
boast	1
of	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
looked	1
after	1
enough	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
it	1
is	1
But	1
you	1
work	1
your	1
land	1
with	1
hired	1
laborers	1
We	1
re	1
all	1
peasants	1
together	1
We	1
go	1
into	1
everything	1
ourselves	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
no	1
use	1
he	1
can	1
go	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
manage	1
by	1
ourselves	1
Father	1
Finogen	1
wants	1
some	1
tar	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
clogs	1
coming	1
in	1
Yes	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
sir	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
crossing	1
himself	1
deliberately	1
he	1
thanked	1
Levin	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
When	1
Levin	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
kitchen	1
to	1
call	1
his	1
coachman	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
at	1
dinner	1
The	1
women	1
were	1
standing	1
up	1
waiting	1
on	1
them	1
The	1
young	1
sturdy	1
looking	1
son	1
was	1
telling	1
something	1
funny	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
pudding	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
laughing	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
clogs	1
who	1
was	1
pouring	1
cabbage	1
soup	1
into	1
a	1
bowl	1
laughing	1
most	1
merrily	1
of	1
all	1
Very	1
probably	1
the	1
good	1
looking	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
clogs	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
well	1
being	1
this	1
peasant	1
household	1
made	1
upon	1
Levin	1
but	1
the	1
impression	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
Levin	1
could	1
never	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
peasant	1
s	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
he	1
kept	1
recalling	1
this	1
peasant	1
farm	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
impression	1
that	1
demanded	1
his	1
special	1
attention	1
Chapter	1
26	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
his	1
district	1
He	1
was	1
five	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
Levin	1
and	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
married	1
His	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
Levin	1
liked	1
very	1
much	1
lived	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
would	1
have	1
greatly	1
liked	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
girl	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
knew	1
this	1
with	1
certainty	1
as	1
so	1
called	1
eligible	1
young	1
men	1
always	1
know	1
it	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
brought	1
himself	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
although	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
and	1
although	1
by	1
every	1
token	1
this	1
very	1
attractive	1
girl	1
would	1
make	1
an	1
excellent	1
wife	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
married	1
her	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Kitty	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
flown	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sky	1
And	1
this	1
knowledge	1
poisoned	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
On	1
getting	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
letter	1
with	1
the	1
invitation	1
for	1
shooting	1
Levin	1
had	1
immediately	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
having	1
such	1
views	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
simply	1
his	1
own	1
groundless	1
supposition	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
Besides	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
try	1
himself	1
put	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
girl	1
The	1
Sviazhskys	1
home	1
life	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pleasant	1
and	1
Sviazhsky	1
himself	1
the	1
best	1
type	1
of	1
man	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
local	1
affairs	1
that	1
Levin	1
knew	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
him	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
always	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
wonder	1
to	1
Levin	1
whose	1
convictions	1
very	1
logical	1
though	1
never	1
original	1
go	1
one	1
way	1
by	1
themselves	1
while	1
their	1
life	1
exceedingly	1
definite	1
and	1
firm	1
in	1
its	1
direction	1
goes	1
its	1
way	1
quite	1
apart	1
and	1
almost	1
always	1
in	1
direct	1
contradiction	1
to	1
their	1
convictions	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
an	1
extremely	1
advanced	1
man	1
He	1
despised	1
the	1
nobility	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
to	1
be	1
secretly	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
serfdom	1
and	1
only	1
concealing	1
their	1
views	1
from	1
cowardice	1
He	1
regarded	1
Russia	1
as	1
a	1
ruined	1
country	1
rather	1
after	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
Turkey	1
and	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Russia	1
as	1
so	1
bad	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
permitted	1
himself	1
to	1
criticize	1
its	1
doings	1
seriously	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
functionary	1
of	1
that	1
government	1
and	1
a	1
model	1
marshal	1
of	1
nobility	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
drove	1
about	1
he	1
always	1
wore	1
the	1
cockade	1
of	1
office	1
and	1
the	1
cap	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
band	1
He	1
considered	1
human	1
life	1
only	1
tolerable	1
abroad	1
and	1
went	1
abroad	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
every	1
opportunity	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
carried	1
on	1
a	1
complex	1
and	1
improved	1
system	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
Russia	1
and	1
with	1
extreme	1
interest	1
followed	1
everything	1
and	1
knew	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
in	1
Russia	1
He	1
considered	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
as	1
occupying	1
a	1
stage	1
of	1
development	1
intermediate	1
between	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
assemblies	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
readier	1
to	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
opinion	1
He	1
believed	1
neither	1
in	1
God	1
nor	1
the	1
devil	1
but	1
was	1
much	1
concerned	1
about	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
the	1
clergy	1
and	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
their	1
revenues	1
and	1
took	1
special	1
trouble	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
his	1
village	1
On	1
the	1
woman	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
advocates	1
of	1
complete	1
liberty	1
for	1
women	1
and	1
especially	1
their	1
right	1
to	1
labor	1
But	1
he	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
such	1
terms	1
that	1
their	1
affectionate	1
childless	1
home	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
everyone	1
and	1
arranged	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
nothing	1
and	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
share	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
efforts	1
that	1
her	1
time	1
should	1
pass	1
as	1
happily	1
and	1
as	1
agreeably	1
as	1
possible	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
interpretation	1
on	1
people	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
character	1
would	1
have	1
presented	1
no	1
doubt	1
or	1
difficulty	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
fool	1
or	1
a	1
knave	1
and	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
clear	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
fool	1
because	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
clever	1
and	1
moreover	1
a	1
highly	1
cultivated	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
modest	1
over	1
his	1
culture	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
subject	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
display	1
his	1
knowledge	1
except	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
Still	1
less	1
could	1
Levin	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
knave	1
as	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
an	1
honest	1
good	1
hearted	1
sensible	1
man	1
who	1
worked	1
good	1
humoredly	1
keenly	1
and	1
perseveringly	1
at	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
was	1
held	1
in	1
high	1
honor	1
by	1
everyone	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
certainly	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
consciously	1
done	1
and	1
was	1
indeed	1
incapable	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
base	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
living	1
enigma	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
very	1
friendly	1
and	1
so	1
Levin	1
used	1
to	1
venture	1
to	1
sound	1
Sviazhsky	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
foundation	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
vain	1
Every	1
time	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
penetrate	1
beyond	1
the	1
outer	1
chambers	1
of	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
mind	1
which	1
were	1
hospitably	1
open	1
to	1
all	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
slightly	1
disconcerted	1
faint	1
signs	1
of	1
alarm	1
were	1
visible	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
Levin	1
would	1
understand	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
kindly	1
good	1
humored	1
repulse	1
Just	1
now	1
since	1
his	1
disenchantment	1
with	1
farming	1
Levin	1
was	1
particularly	1
glad	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
Sviazhsky	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
happy	1
and	1
affectionate	1
couple	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
themselves	1
and	1
everyone	1
else	1
and	1
their	1
well	1
ordered	1
home	1
had	1
always	1
a	1
cheering	1
effect	1
on	1
Levin	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
longing	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
that	1
secret	1
in	1
Sviazhsky	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
such	1
clearness	1
definiteness	1
and	1
good	1
courage	1
in	1
life	1
Moreover	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
at	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
he	1
should	1
meet	1
the	1
landowners	1
of	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
particularly	1
interesting	1
for	1
him	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
those	1
rural	1
conversations	1
concerning	1
crops	1
laborers	1
wages	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
are	1
conventionally	1
regarded	1
as	1
something	1
very	1
low	1
but	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
constitute	1
the	1
one	1
subject	1
of	1
importance	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
perhaps	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
serfdom	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
England	1
In	1
both	1
cases	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
agriculture	1
are	1
firmly	1
established	1
but	1
among	1
us	1
now	1
when	1
everything	1
has	1
been	1
turned	1
upside	1
down	1
and	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
taking	1
shape	1
the	1
question	1
what	1
form	1
these	1
conditions	1
will	1
take	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
question	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
Russia	1
thought	1
Levin	1
The	1
shooting	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
Levin	1
had	1
expected	1
The	1
marsh	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
grouse	1
at	1
all	1
He	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
only	1
brought	1
back	1
three	1
birds	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
from	1
shooting	1
an	1
excellent	1
appetite	1
excellent	1
spirits	1
and	1
that	1
keen	1
intellectual	1
mood	1
which	1
with	1
him	1
always	1
accompanied	1
violent	1
physical	1
exertion	1
And	1
while	1
out	1
shooting	1
when	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
suddenly	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
kept	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
claim	1
not	1
merely	1
his	1
attention	1
but	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
some	1
question	1
connected	1
with	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
tea	1
two	1
landowners	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
about	1
some	1
business	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
wardship	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
and	1
the	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
sprang	1
up	1
Levin	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
his	1
hostess	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
and	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
him	1
Madame	1
Sviazhskaya	1
was	1
a	1
round	1
faced	1
fair	1
haired	1
rather	1
short	1
woman	1
all	1
smiles	1
and	1
dimples	1
Levin	1
tried	1
through	1
her	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
weighty	1
enigma	1
her	1
husband	1
presented	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
complete	1
freedom	1
of	1
ideas	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
This	1
agony	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dress	1
specially	1
put	1
on	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
for	1
his	1
benefit	1
cut	1
particularly	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
trapeze	1
on	1
her	1
white	1
bosom	1
This	1
quadrangular	1
opening	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
bosom	1
s	1
being	1
very	1
white	1
or	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
white	1
deprived	1
Levin	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
faculties	1
He	1
imagined	1
probably	1
mistakenly	1
that	1
this	1
low	1
necked	1
bodice	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
on	1
his	1
account	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
necked	1
bodice	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
deceived	1
someone	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
explain	1
something	1
but	1
that	1
to	1
explain	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
blushing	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
awkward	1
His	1
awkwardness	1
infected	1
the	1
pretty	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
too	1
But	1
their	1
hostess	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
observe	1
this	1
and	1
kept	1
purposely	1
drawing	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
You	1
say	1
she	1
said	1
pursuing	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
started	1
that	1
my	1
husband	1
cannot	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
s	1
Russian	1
It	1
s	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
cheerful	1
spirits	1
abroad	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
here	1
Here	1
he	1
feels	1
in	1
his	1
proper	1
place	1
He	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
interesting	1
himself	1
in	1
everything	1
Oh	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
our	1
school	1
have	1
you	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
it	1
The	1
little	1
house	1
covered	1
with	1
ivy	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
Nastia	1
s	1
work	1
she	1
said	1
indicating	1
her	1
sister	1
You	1
teach	1
in	1
it	1
yourself	1
asked	1
Levin	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
above	1
the	1
open	1
neck	1
but	1
feeling	1
that	1
wherever	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
it	1
Yes	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
teach	1
in	1
it	1
myself	1
and	1
do	1
teach	1
still	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
schoolmistress	1
now	1
And	1
we	1
ve	1
started	1
gymnastic	1
exercises	1
No	1
thank	1
you	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
tea	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
rude	1
thing	1
but	1
incapable	1
of	1
continuing	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
blushing	1
I	1
hear	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
sitting	1
sideways	1
with	1
one	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
a	1
cup	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
his	1
beard	1
held	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
smelling	1
it	1
His	1
brilliant	1
black	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
the	1
excited	1
country	1
gentleman	1
with	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
and	1
apparently	1
he	1
derived	1
amusement	1
from	1
his	1
remarks	1
The	1
gentleman	1
was	1
complaining	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
Sviazhsky	1
knew	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman	1
s	1
complaints	1
which	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
demolish	1
his	1
whole	1
contention	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
this	1
answer	1
and	1
listened	1
not	1
without	1
pleasure	1
to	1
the	1
landowner	1
s	1
comic	1
speeches	1
The	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
was	1
obviously	1
an	1
inveterate	1
adherent	1
of	1
serfdom	1
and	1
a	1
devoted	1
agriculturist	1
who	1
had	1
lived	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Levin	1
saw	1
proofs	1
of	1
this	1
in	1
his	1
dress	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
fashioned	1
threadbare	1
coat	1
obviously	1
not	1
his	1
everyday	1
attire	1
in	1
his	1
shrewd	1
deep	1
set	1
eyes	1
in	1
his	1
idiomatic	1
fluent	1
Russian	1
in	1
the	1
imperious	1
tone	1
that	1
had	1
become	1
habitual	1
from	1
long	1
use	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
resolute	1
gestures	1
of	1
his	1
large	1
red	1
sunburnt	1
hands	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
betrothal	1
ring	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
finger	1
Chapter	1
27	1
If	1
I	1
d	1
only	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
throw	1
up	1
what	1
s	1
been	1
set	1
going	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
trouble	1
wasted	1
I	1
d	1
turn	1
my	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
sell	1
up	1
go	1
off	1
like	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanovitch	1
to	1
hear	1
La	1
Belle	1
H'el`ene	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
lighting	1
up	1
his	1
shrewd	1
old	1
face	1
But	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
throw	1
it	1
up	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanovitch	1
Sviazhsky	1
so	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
gained	1
The	1
only	1
gain	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
house	1
neither	1
bought	1
nor	1
hired	1
Besides	1
one	1
keeps	1
hoping	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
learn	1
sense	1
Though	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
you	1
d	1
never	1
believe	1
it	1
the	1
drunkenness	1
the	1
immorality	1
They	1
keep	1
chopping	1
and	1
changing	1
their	1
bits	1
of	1
land	1
Not	1
a	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
horse	1
or	1
a	1
cow	1
The	1
peasant	1
s	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger	1
but	1
just	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
laborer	1
he	1
ll	1
do	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
mischief	1
and	1
then	1
bring	1
you	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
But	1
then	1
you	1
make	1
complaints	1
to	1
the	1
justice	1
too	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
I	1
lodge	1
complaints	1
Not	1
for	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
Such	1
a	1
talking	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
cause	1
to	1
regret	1
it	1
At	1
the	1
works	1
for	1
instance	1
they	1
pocketed	1
the	1
advance	1
money	1
and	1
made	1
off	1
What	1
did	1
the	1
justice	1
do	1
Why	1
acquitted	1
them	1
Nothing	1
keeps	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
communal	1
court	1
and	1
their	1
village	1
elder	1
He	1
ll	1
flog	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
style	1
But	1
for	1
that	1
there	1
d	1
be	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
Obviously	1
the	1
landowner	1
was	1
chaffing	1
Sviazhsky	1
who	1
far	1
from	1
resenting	1
it	1
was	1
apparently	1
amused	1
by	1
it	1
But	1
you	1
see	1
we	1
manage	1
our	1
land	1
without	1
such	1
extreme	1
measures	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
Levin	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
this	1
gentleman	1
He	1
indicated	1
the	1
other	1
landowner	1
Yes	1
the	1
thing	1
s	1
done	1
at	1
Mihail	1
Petrovitch	1
s	1
but	1
ask	1
him	1
how	1
it	1
s	1
done	1
Do	1
you	1
call	1
that	1
a	1
rational	1
system	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
obviously	1
rather	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
rational	1
My	1
system	1
s	1
very	1
simple	1
said	1
Mihail	1
Petrovitch	1
thank	1
God	1
All	1
my	1
management	1
rests	1
on	1
getting	1
the	1
money	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
autumn	1
taxes	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
Father	1
master	1
help	1
us	1
Well	1
the	1
peasants	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
s	1
neighbors	1
one	1
feels	1
for	1
them	1
So	1
one	1
advances	1
them	1
a	1
third	1
but	1
one	1
says	1
Remember	1
lads	1
I	1
have	1
helped	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
help	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
need	1
it	1
whether	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
sowing	1
of	1
the	1
oats	1
or	1
the	1
haycutting	1
or	1
the	1
harvest	1
and	1
well	1
one	1
agrees	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
each	1
taxpayer	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
dishonest	1
ones	1
among	1
them	1
too	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
familiar	1
with	1
these	1
patriarchal	1
methods	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
interrupted	1
Mihail	1
Petrovitch	1
turning	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
Then	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
system	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
adopt	1
nowadays	1
Why	1
manage	1
like	1
Mihail	1
Petrovitch	1
or	1
let	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
half	1
the	1
crop	1
or	1
for	1
rent	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
do	1
only	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
how	1
the	1
general	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
being	1
ruined	1
Where	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
serf	1
labor	1
and	1
good	1
management	1
gave	1
a	1
yield	1
of	1
nine	1
to	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
half	1
crop	1
system	1
it	1
yields	1
three	1
to	1
one	1
Russia	1
has	1
been	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
emancipation	1
Sviazhsky	1
looked	1
with	1
smiling	1
eyes	1
at	1
Levin	1
and	1
even	1
made	1
a	1
faint	1
gesture	1
of	1
irony	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
landowner	1
s	1
words	1
absurd	1
he	1
understood	1
them	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
Sviazhsky	1
A	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
said	1
to	1
show	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
Russia	1
was	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
emancipation	1
struck	1
him	1
indeed	1
as	1
very	1
true	1
new	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
quite	1
incontestable	1
The	1
landowner	1
unmistakably	1
spoke	1
his	1
own	1
individual	1
thought	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
very	1
rarely	1
happens	1
and	1
a	1
thought	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
desire	1
of	1
finding	1
some	1
exercise	1
for	1
an	1
idle	1
brain	1
but	1
a	1
thought	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brooded	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
had	1
considered	1
in	1
every	1
aspect	1
The	1
point	1
is	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
progress	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
is	1
only	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
authority	1
he	1
said	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
culture	1
Take	1
the	1
reforms	1
of	1
Peter	1
of	1
Catherine	1
of	1
Alexander	1
Take	1
European	1
history	1
And	1
progress	1
in	1
agriculture	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
the	1
potato	1
for	1
instance	1
that	1
was	1
introduced	1
among	1
us	1
by	1
force	1
The	1
wooden	1
plough	1
too	1
wasn	1
t	1
always	1
used	1
It	1
was	1
introduced	1
maybe	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
Empire	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
probably	1
brought	1
in	1
by	1
force	1
Now	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
day	1
we	1
landowners	1
in	1
the	1
serf	1
times	1
used	1
various	1
improvements	1
in	1
our	1
husbandry	1
drying	1
machines	1
and	1
thrashing	1
machines	1
and	1
carting	1
manure	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
modern	1
implements	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
brought	1
into	1
use	1
by	1
our	1
authority	1
and	1
the	1
peasants	1
opposed	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
ended	1
by	1
imitating	1
us	1
Now	1
by	1
the	1
abolition	1
of	1
serfdom	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
deprived	1
of	1
our	1
authority	1
and	1
so	1
our	1
husbandry	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
raised	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
level	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
sink	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
savage	1
primitive	1
condition	1
That	1
s	1
how	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
But	1
why	1
so	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
rational	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
with	1
hired	1
labor	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
We	1
ve	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
With	1
whom	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
system	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
There	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
labor	1
force	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
in	1
agriculture	1
thought	1
Levin	1
With	1
laborers	1
The	1
laborers	1
won	1
t	1
work	1
well	1
and	1
won	1
t	1
work	1
with	1
good	1
implements	1
Our	1
laborer	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
get	1
drunk	1
like	1
a	1
pig	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
s	1
drunk	1
he	1
ruins	1
everything	1
you	1
give	1
him	1
He	1
makes	1
the	1
horses	1
ill	1
with	1
too	1
much	1
water	1
cuts	1
good	1
harness	1
barters	1
the	1
tires	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
for	1
drink	1
drops	1
bits	1
of	1
iron	1
into	1
the	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
He	1
loathes	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
after	1
his	1
fashion	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
level	1
of	1
husbandry	1
has	1
fallen	1
Lands	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
cultivation	1
overgrown	1
with	1
weeds	1
or	1
divided	1
among	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
where	1
millions	1
of	1
bushels	1
were	1
raised	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
has	1
decreased	1
If	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
but	1
with	1
care	1
that	1
And	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
unfold	1
his	1
own	1
scheme	1
of	1
emancipation	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
these	1
drawbacks	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
avoided	1
This	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
Levin	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
Levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
first	1
position	1
and	1
addressing	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
into	1
expressing	1
his	1
serious	1
opinion	1
That	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
culture	1
is	1
falling	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
our	1
present	1
relations	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
farming	1
on	1
a	1
rational	1
system	1
to	1
yield	1
a	1
profit	1
that	1
s	1
perfectly	1
true	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
Sviazhsky	1
replied	1
quite	1
seriously	1
all	1
I	1
see	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
cultivate	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
system	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
the	1
serf	1
days	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
too	1
high	1
but	1
too	1
low	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
machines	1
no	1
good	1
stock	1
no	1
efficient	1
supervision	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
keep	1
accounts	1
Ask	1
any	1
landowner	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
crop	1
s	1
profitable	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
not	1
Italian	1
bookkeeping	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
ironically	1
You	1
may	1
keep	1
your	1
books	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
spoil	1
everything	1
for	1
you	1
there	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
any	1
profit	1
Why	1
do	1
they	1
spoil	1
things	1
A	1
poor	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
or	1
your	1
Russian	1
presser	1
they	1
will	1
break	1
but	1
my	1
steam	1
press	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
break	1
A	1
wretched	1
Russian	1
nag	1
they	1
ll	1
ruin	1
but	1
keep	1
good	1
dray	1
horses	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
ruin	1
them	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
round	1
We	1
must	1
raise	1
our	1
farming	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
level	1
Oh	1
if	1
one	1
only	1
had	1
the	1
means	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanovitch	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
son	1
to	1
keep	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
lads	1
to	1
be	1
educated	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
school	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
buy	1
these	1
dray	1
horses	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
banks	1
are	1
for	1
To	1
get	1
what	1
s	1
left	1
me	1
sold	1
by	1
auction	1
No	1
thank	1
you	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
agree	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
necessary	1
or	1
possible	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
agriculture	1
still	1
higher	1
said	1
Levin	1
I	1
devote	1
myself	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
means	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
banks	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
re	1
any	1
good	1
For	1
my	1
part	1
anyway	1
whatever	1
I	1
ve	1
spent	1
money	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
husbandry	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
loss	1
stock	1
a	1
loss	1
machinery	1
a	1
loss	1
That	1
s	1
true	1
enough	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
chimed	1
in	1
positively	1
laughing	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
pursued	1
Levin	1
I	1
mix	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
neighboring	1
landowners	1
who	1
are	1
cultivating	1
their	1
land	1
on	1
a	1
rational	1
system	1
they	1
all	1
with	1
rare	1
exceptions	1
are	1
doing	1
so	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
Come	1
tell	1
us	1
how	1
does	1
your	1
land	1
do	1
does	1
it	1
pay	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
he	1
detected	1
that	1
fleeting	1
expression	1
of	1
alarm	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
whenever	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
penetrate	1
beyond	1
the	1
outer	1
chambers	1
of	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
mind	1
Moreover	1
this	1
question	1
on	1
Levin	1
s	1
part	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
in	1
good	1
faith	1
Madame	1
Sviazhskaya	1
had	1
just	1
told	1
him	1
at	1
tea	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
that	1
summer	1
invited	1
a	1
German	1
expert	1
in	1
bookkeeping	1
from	1
Moscow	1
who	1
for	1
a	1
consideration	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
roubles	1
had	1
investigated	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
their	1
property	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
costing	1
them	1
a	1
loss	1
of	1
three	1
thousand	1
odd	1
roubles	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
precise	1
sum	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
the	1
German	1
had	1
worked	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
fraction	1
of	1
a	1
farthing	1
The	1
gray	1
whiskered	1
landowner	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
famling	1
obviously	1
aware	1
how	1
much	1
gain	1
his	1
neighbor	1
and	1
marshal	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
Possibly	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
pay	1
answered	1
Sviazhsky	1
That	1
merely	1
proves	1
either	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
bad	1
manager	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
sunk	1
my	1
capital	1
for	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
my	1
rents	1
Oh	1
rent	1
Levin	1
cried	1
with	1
horror	1
Rent	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
Europe	1
where	1
land	1
has	1
been	1
improved	1
by	1
the	1
labor	1
put	1
into	1
it	1
but	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
deteriorating	1
from	1
the	1
labor	1
put	1
into	1
it	1
in	1
other	1
words	1
they	1
re	1
working	1
it	1
out	1
so	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
question	1
of	1
rent	1
How	1
no	1
rent	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
law	1
Then	1
we	1
re	1
outside	1
the	1
law	1
rent	1
explains	1
nothing	1
for	1
us	1
but	1
simply	1
muddles	1
us	1
No	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
theory	1
of	1
rent	1
Will	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
junket	1
Masha	1
pass	1
us	1
some	1
junket	1
or	1
raspberries	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
Extraordinarily	1
late	1
the	1
raspberries	1
are	1
lasting	1
this	1
year	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
Sviazhsky	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
off	1
apparently	1
supposing	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
have	1
ended	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
when	1
to	1
Levin	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
Having	1
lost	1
his	1
antagonist	1
Levin	1
continued	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskered	1
landowner	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
and	1
habits	1
of	1
our	1
laborer	1
but	1
the	1
landowner	1
like	1
all	1
men	1
who	1
think	1
independently	1
and	1
in	1
isolation	1
was	1
slow	1
in	1
taking	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
s	1
idea	1
and	1
particularly	1
partial	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
He	1
stuck	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
is	1
a	1
swine	1
and	1
likes	1
swinishness	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
swinishness	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
authority	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
stick	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
become	1
so	1
liberal	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
replaced	1
the	1
stick	1
that	1
served	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
by	1
lawyers	1
and	1
model	1
prisons	1
where	1
the	1
worthless	1
stinking	1
peasant	1
is	1
fed	1
on	1
good	1
soup	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
fixed	1
allowance	1
of	1
cubic	1
feet	1
of	1
air	1
What	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
said	1
Levin	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
laborer	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
labor	1
would	1
become	1
productive	1
That	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasantry	1
we	1
ve	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
them	1
answered	1
the	1
landowner	1
How	1
can	1
new	1
conditions	1
be	1
found	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
Having	1
eaten	1
some	1
junket	1
and	1
lighted	1
a	1
cigarette	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
discussion	1
All	1
possible	1
relations	1
to	1
the	1
labor	1
force	1
have	1
been	1
defined	1
and	1
studied	1
he	1
said	1
The	1
relic	1
of	1
barbarism	1
the	1
primitive	1
commune	1
with	1
each	1
guarantee	1
for	1
all	1
will	1
disappear	1
of	1
itself	1
serfdom	1
has	1
been	1
abolished	1
there	1
remains	1
nothing	1
but	1
free	1
labor	1
and	1
its	1
forms	1
are	1
fixed	1
and	1
ready	1
made	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
adopted	1
Permanent	1
hands	1
day	1
laborers	1
rammers	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
forms	1
But	1
Europe	1
is	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
these	1
forms	1
Dissatisfied	1
and	1
seeking	1
new	1
ones	1
And	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
meaning	1
answered	1
Levin	1
Why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
we	1
seek	1
them	1
for	1
ourselves	1
Because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
just	1
like	1
inventing	1
afresh	1
the	1
means	1
for	1
constructing	1
railways	1
They	1
are	1
ready	1
invented	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
if	1
they	1
re	1
stupid	1
said	1
Levin	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
detected	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
alarm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Sviazhsky	1
Oh	1
yes	1
we	1
ll	1
bury	1
the	1
world	1
under	1
our	1
caps	1
We	1
ve	1
found	1
the	1
secret	1
Europe	1
was	1
seeking	1
for	1
I	1
ve	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
but	1
excuse	1
me	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Europe	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
labor	1
No	1
very	1
little	1
That	1
question	1
is	1
now	1
absorbing	1
the	1
best	1
minds	1
in	1
Europe	1
The	1
Schulze	1
Delitsch	1
movement	1
And	1
then	1
all	1
this	1
enormous	1
literature	1
of	1
the	1
labor	1
question	1
the	1
most	1
liberal	1
Lassalle	1
movement	1
the	1
Mulhausen	1
experiment	1
That	1
s	1
a	1
fact	1
by	1
now	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
probably	1
aware	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
very	1
vague	1
No	1
you	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
sociology	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
it	1
interested	1
me	1
and	1
really	1
if	1
it	1
interests	1
you	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
study	1
it	1
But	1
what	1
conclusion	1
have	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Excuse	1
me	1
The	1
two	1
neighbors	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
Sviazhsky	1
once	1
more	1
checking	1
Levin	1
in	1
his	1
inconvenient	1
habit	1
of	1
peeping	1
into	1
what	1
was	1
beyond	1
the	1
outer	1
chambers	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
guests	1
out	1
Chapter	1
28	1
Levin	1
was	1
insufferably	1
bored	1
that	1
evening	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
he	1
was	1
stirred	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
dissatisfaction	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
with	1
his	1
system	1
of	1
managing	1
his	1
land	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
exceptional	1
case	1
but	1
the	1
general	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
Russia	1
that	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
some	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
laborers	1
to	1
the	1
soil	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
work	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
half	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
Sviazhskys	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
dream	1
but	1
a	1
problem	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
solved	1
And	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
problem	1
could	1
be	1
solved	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
solve	1
it	1
After	1
saying	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
promising	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
expedition	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
see	1
an	1
interesting	1
ruin	1
in	1
the	1
crown	1
forest	1
Levin	1
went	1
before	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
into	1
his	1
host	1
s	1
study	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
books	1
on	1
the	1
labor	1
question	1
that	1
Sviazhsky	1
had	1
offered	1
him	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
study	1
was	1
a	1
huge	1
room	1
surrounded	1
by	1
bookcases	1
and	1
with	1
two	1
tables	1
in	1
it	1
one	1
a	1
massive	1
writing	1
table	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
recent	1
numbers	1
of	1
reviews	1
and	1
journals	1
in	1
different	1
languages	1
ranged	1
like	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
a	1
star	1
round	1
the	1
lamp	1
On	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
stand	1
of	1
drawers	1
marked	1
with	1
gold	1
lettering	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
papers	1
of	1
various	1
sorts	1
Sviazhsky	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
books	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
rocking	1
chair	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
looking	1
at	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
round	1
table	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
reviews	1
Oh	1
yes	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
article	1
here	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
of	1
the	1
review	1
Levin	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
It	1
appears	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
eager	1
interest	1
that	1
Friedrich	1
was	1
not	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
person	1
chiefly	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
Poland	1
It	1
is	1
proved	1
And	1
with	1
his	1
characteristic	1
clearness	1
he	1
summed	1
up	1
those	1
new	1
very	1
important	1
and	1
interesting	1
revelations	1
Although	1
Levin	1
was	1
engrossed	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
by	1
his	1
ideas	1
about	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
wondered	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
Sviazhsky	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
inside	1
of	1
him	1
And	1
why	1
why	1
is	1
he	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
Poland	1
When	1
Sviazhsky	1
had	1
finished	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
asking	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
then	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
follow	1
It	1
was	1
simply	1
interesting	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
But	1
Sviazhsky	1
did	1
not	1
explain	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
explain	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
interesting	1
to	1
him	1
Yes	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
your	1
irritable	1
neighbor	1
said	1
Levin	1
sighing	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
clever	1
fellow	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
lot	1
that	1
was	1
true	1
Oh	1
get	1
along	1
with	1
you	1
An	1
inveterate	1
supporter	1
of	1
serfdom	1
at	1
heart	1
like	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
Whose	1
marshal	1
you	1
are	1
Yes	1
only	1
I	1
marshal	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
direction	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
laughing	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
interests	1
me	1
very	1
much	1
said	1
Levin	1
He	1
s	1
right	1
that	1
our	1
system	1
that	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
rational	1
farming	1
doesn	1
t	1
answer	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
answers	1
is	1
the	1
money	1
lender	1
system	1
like	1
that	1
meek	1
looking	1
gentleman	1
s	1
or	1
else	1
the	1
very	1
simplest	1
Whose	1
fault	1
is	1
it	1
Our	1
own	1
of	1
course	1
Besides	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
answer	1
It	1
answers	1
with	1
Vassiltchikov	1
A	1
factory	1
But	1
I	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
are	1
surprised	1
at	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
low	1
stage	1
of	1
rational	1
and	1
moral	1
development	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
obvious	1
they	1
re	1
bound	1
to	1
oppose	1
everything	1
that	1
s	1
strange	1
to	1
them	1
In	1
Europe	1
a	1
rational	1
system	1
answers	1
because	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
educated	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
educate	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
But	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
educate	1
the	1
people	1
To	1
educate	1
the	1
people	1
three	1
things	1
are	1
needed	1
schools	1
and	1
schools	1
and	1
schools	1
But	1
you	1
said	1
yourself	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
low	1
stage	1
of	1
material	1
development	1
what	1
help	1
are	1
schools	1
for	1
that	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
advice	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
You	1
should	1
try	1
purgative	1
medicine	1
Taken	1
worse	1
Try	1
leeches	1
Tried	1
them	1
worse	1
Well	1
then	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
left	1
but	1
to	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
Tried	1
it	1
worse	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
I	1
say	1
political	1
economy	1
you	1
say	1
worse	1
I	1
say	1
socialism	1
worse	1
Education	1
worse	1
But	1
how	1
do	1
schools	1
help	1
matters	1
They	1
give	1
the	1
peasant	1
fresh	1
wants	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
ve	1
never	1
understood	1
Levin	1
replied	1
with	1
heat	1
In	1
what	1
way	1
are	1
schools	1
going	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
improve	1
their	1
material	1
position	1
You	1
say	1
schools	1
education	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
fresh	1
wants	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
since	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
satisfying	1
them	1
And	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
addition	1
and	1
subtraction	1
and	1
the	1
catechism	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
improve	1
their	1
material	1
condition	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
The	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
I	1
met	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
baby	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
She	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
woman	1
her	1
boy	1
had	1
screaming	1
fits	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
doctored	1
I	1
asked	1
Why	1
how	1
does	1
the	1
wise	1
woman	1
cure	1
screaming	1
fits	1
She	1
puts	1
the	1
child	1
on	1
the	1
hen	1
roost	1
and	1
repeats	1
some	1
charm	1
Well	1
you	1
re	1
saying	1
it	1
yourself	1
What	1
s	1
wanted	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
taking	1
her	1
child	1
to	1
the	1
hen	1
roost	1
to	1
cure	1
it	1
of	1
screaming	1
fits	1
is	1
just	1
Sviazhsky	1
said	1
smiling	1
good	1
humoredly	1
Oh	1
no	1
said	1
Levin	1
with	1
annoyance	1
that	1
method	1
of	1
doctoring	1
I	1
merely	1
meant	1
as	1
a	1
simile	1
for	1
doctoring	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
schools	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
poor	1
and	1
ignorant	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
woman	1
sees	1
the	1
baby	1
is	1
ill	1
because	1
it	1
screams	1
But	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
this	1
trouble	1
of	1
poverty	1
and	1
ignorance	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
cured	1
by	1
schools	1
is	1
as	1
incomprehensible	1
as	1
how	1
the	1
hen	1
roost	1
affects	1
the	1
screaming	1
What	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
cured	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
him	1
poor	1
Well	1
in	1
that	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
re	1
in	1
agreement	1
with	1
Spencer	1
whom	1
you	1
dislike	1
so	1
much	1
He	1
says	1
too	1
that	1
education	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
greater	1
prosperity	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
more	1
frequent	1
washing	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
Well	1
then	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
or	1
the	1
contrary	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
agreement	1
with	1
Spencer	1
only	1
I	1
ve	1
known	1
it	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Schools	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
good	1
what	1
will	1
do	1
good	1
is	1
an	1
economic	1
organization	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
become	1
richer	1
will	1
have	1
more	1

and	1
then	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
schools	1
Still	1
all	1
over	1
Europe	1
now	1
schools	1
are	1
obligatory	1
And	1
how	1
far	1
do	1
you	1
agree	1
with	1
Spencer	1
yourself	1
about	1
it	1
asked	1
Levin	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
alarm	1
in	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
No	1
that	1
screaming	1
story	1
is	1
positively	1
capital	1
Did	1
you	1
really	1
hear	1
it	1
yourself	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
Obviously	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
what	1
his	1
reasoning	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
reasoning	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
reasoning	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
blind	1
alley	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
he	1
disliked	1
and	1
avoided	1
by	1
changing	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
something	1
agreeable	1
and	1
amusing	1
All	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
beginning	1
with	1
the	1
impression	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
peasant	1
which	1
served	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
fundamental	1
basis	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
conceptions	1
and	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
threw	1
Levin	1
into	1
violent	1
excitement	1
This	1
dear	1
good	1
Sviazhsky	1
keeping	1
a	1
stock	1
of	1
ideas	1
simply	1
for	1
social	1
purposes	1
and	1
obviously	1
having	1
some	1
other	1
principles	1
hidden	1
from	1
Levin	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
crowd	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
legion	1
he	1
guided	1
public	1
opinion	1
by	1
ideas	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
share	1
that	1
irascible	1
country	1
gentleman	1
perfectly	1
correct	1
in	1
the	1
conclusions	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
worried	1
into	1
by	1
life	1
but	1
wrong	1
in	1
his	1
exasperation	1
against	1
a	1
whole	1
class	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
class	1
in	1
Russia	1
his	1
own	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
work	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
and	1
the	1
vague	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
all	1
was	1
blended	1
in	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
inward	1
turmoil	1
and	1
anticipation	1
of	1
some	1
solution	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
Left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
assigned	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1
a	1
spring	1
mattress	1
that	1
yielded	1
unexpectedly	1
at	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
or	1
his	1
leg	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
asleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Not	1
one	1
conversation	1
with	1
Sviazhsky	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
that	1
was	1
clever	1
had	1
interested	1
Levin	1
but	1
the	1
conclusions	1
of	1
the	1
irascible	1
landowner	1
required	1
consideration	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
recalling	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
in	1
imagination	1
amending	1
his	1
own	1
replies	1
Yes	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
our	1
husbandry	1
does	1
not	1
answer	1
because	1
the	1
peasant	1
hates	1
improvements	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
forced	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
authority	1
If	1
no	1
system	1
of	1
husbandry	1
answered	1
at	1
all	1
without	1
these	1
improvements	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
right	1
But	1
the	1
only	1
system	1
that	1
does	1
answer	1
is	1
where	1
laborer	1
is	1
working	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
habits	1
just	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
peasant	1
s	1
land	1
half	1
way	1
here	1
Your	1
and	1
our	1
general	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
system	1
shows	1
that	1
either	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
blame	1
or	1
the	1
laborers	1
We	1
have	1
gone	1
our	1
way	1
the	1
European	1
way	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
without	1
asking	1
ourselves	1
about	1
the	1
qualities	1
of	1
our	1
labor	1
force	1
Let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
labor	1
force	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
abstract	1
force	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
with	1
his	1
instincts	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
arrange	1
our	1
system	1
of	1
culture	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
that	1
Imagine	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
system	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
peasant	1
has	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
found	1
means	1
of	1
making	1
your	1
laborers	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
happy	1
mean	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
improvements	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
admit	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
without	1
exhausting	1
the	1
soil	1
get	1
twice	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
the	1
yield	1
you	1
got	1
before	1
Divide	1
it	1
in	1
halves	1
give	1
half	1
as	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
labor	1
the	1
surplus	1
left	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
greater	1
and	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
labor	1
will	1
be	1
greater	1
too	1
And	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
one	1
must	1
lower	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
husbandry	1
and	1
interest	1
the	1
laborers	1
in	1
its	1
success	1
How	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
detail	1
but	1
undoubtedly	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
This	1
idea	1
threw	1
Levin	1
into	1
a	1
great	1
excitement	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
thinking	1
over	1
in	1
detail	1
the	1
putting	1
of	1
his	1
idea	1
into	1
practice	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
intended	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
next	1
day	1
but	1
he	1
now	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Besides	1
the	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
her	1
low	1
necked	1
bodice	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
remorse	1
for	1
some	1
utterly	1
base	1
action	1
Most	1
important	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
must	1
get	1
back	1
without	1
delay	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
new	1
project	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
before	1
the	1
sowing	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
wheat	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
sowing	1
might	1
be	1
undertaken	1
on	1
a	1
new	1
basis	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
revolutionize	1
his	1
whole	1
system	1
Chapter	1
29	1
The	1
carrying	1
out	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
plan	1
presented	1
many	1
difficulties	1
but	1
he	1
struggled	1
on	1
doing	1
his	1
utmost	1
and	1
attained	1
a	1
result	1
which	1
though	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
desired	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
without	1
self	1
deception	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
attempt	1
was	1
worth	1
the	1
trouble	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
difficulties	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
cultivating	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
everything	1
and	1
begin	1
it	1
all	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
machine	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
mended	1
while	1
in	1
motion	1
When	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
that	1
he	1
arrived	1
home	1
he	1
informed	1
the	1
bailiff	1
of	1
his	1
plans	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
visible	1
pleasure	1
agreed	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
pointing	1
out	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
stupid	1
and	1
useless	1
The	1
bailiff	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
ago	1
but	1
no	1
heed	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
him	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
proposal	1
made	1
by	1
Levin	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
part	1
as	1
shareholder	1
with	1
his	1
laborers	1
in	1
each	1
agricultural	1
undertaking	1
at	1
this	1
the	1
bailiff	1
simply	1
expressed	1
a	1
profound	1
despondency	1
and	1
offered	1
no	1
definite	1
opinion	1
but	1
began	1
immediately	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
urgent	1
necessity	1
of	1
carrying	1
the	1
remaining	1
sheaves	1
of	1
rye	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
of	1
sending	1
the	1
men	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
ploughing	1
so	1
that	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
discussing	1
it	1
On	1
beginning	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
proposition	1
to	1
cede	1
them	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
new	1
terms	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
collision	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
great	1
difficulty	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
much	1
absorbed	1
by	1
the	1
current	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
scheme	1
The	1
simple	1
hearted	1
Ivan	1
the	1
cowherd	1
seemed	1
completely	1
to	1
grasp	1
Levin	1
s	1
proposal	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
take	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
complete	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
plan	1
But	1
when	1
Levin	1
hinted	1
at	1
the	1
future	1
advantages	1
Ivan	1
s	1
face	1
expressed	1
alarm	1
and	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
some	1
task	1
that	1
would	1
admit	1
of	1
no	1
delay	1
he	1
either	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
fork	1
to	1
pitch	1
the	1
hay	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pens	1
or	1
ran	1
to	1
get	1
water	1
or	1
to	1
clear	1
out	1
the	1
dung	1
Another	1
difficulty	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
invincible	1
disbelief	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
that	1
a	1
landowner	1
s	1
object	1
could	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
than	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
squeeze	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
They	1
were	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
real	1
aim	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
And	1
they	1
themselves	1
in	1
giving	1
their	1
opinion	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
but	1
never	1
said	1
what	1
was	1
their	1
real	1
object	1
Moreover	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
irascible	1
landowner	1
had	1
been	1
right	1
the	1
peasants	1
made	1
their	1
first	1
and	1
unalterable	1
condition	1
of	1
any	1
agreement	1
whatever	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
any	1
new	1
methods	1
of	1
tillage	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
nor	1
to	1
use	1
new	1
implements	1
They	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
modern	1
plough	1
ploughed	1
better	1
that	1
the	1
scarifier	1
did	1
the	1
work	1
more	1
quickly	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
thousands	1
of	1
reasons	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
use	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
accepted	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
lower	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
cultivation	1
he	1
felt	1
sorry	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
improved	1
methods	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
obvious	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
difficulties	1
he	1
got	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
by	1
autumn	1
the	1
system	1
was	1
working	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
At	1
first	1
Levin	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
farming	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
the	1
laborers	1
and	1
the	1
bailiff	1
on	1
new	1
conditions	1
of	1
partnership	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
soon	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
divide	1
it	1
up	1
The	1
cattle	1
yard	1
the	1
garden	1
hay	1
fields	1
and	1
arable	1
land	1
divided	1
into	1
several	1
parts	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
into	1
separate	1
lots	1
The	1
simple	1
hearted	1
cowherd	1
Ivan	1
who	1
Levin	1
fancied	1
understood	1
the	1
matter	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
collecting	1
together	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
workers	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
principally	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
became	1
a	1
partner	1
in	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
A	1
distant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
a	1
tract	1
of	1
waste	1
land	1
that	1
had	1
lain	1
fallow	1
for	1
eight	1
years	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
clever	1
carpenter	1
Fyodor	1
Ryezunov	1
taken	1
by	1
six	1
families	1
of	1
peasants	1
on	1
new	1
conditions	1
of	1
partnership	1
and	1
the	1
peasant	1
Shuraev	1
took	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
vegetable	1
gardens	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
terms	1
The	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
still	1
worked	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
system	1
but	1
these	1
three	1
associated	1
partnerships	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
and	1
they	1
completely	1
took	1
up	1
Levin	1
s	1
time	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
cattle	1
yard	1
things	1
went	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
Ivan	1
strenuously	1
opposed	1
warm	1
housing	1
for	1
the	1
cows	1
and	1
butter	1
made	1
of	1
fresh	1
cream	1
affirming	1
that	1
cows	1
require	1
less	1
food	1
if	1
kept	1
cold	1
and	1
that	1
butter	1
is	1
more	1
profitable	1
made	1
from	1
sour	1
cream	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
wages	1
just	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
old	1
system	1
and	1
took	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
received	1
was	1
not	1
wages	1
but	1
an	1
advance	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
future	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
profits	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
Fyodor	1
Ryezunov	1
s	1
company	1
did	1
not	1
plough	1
over	1
the	1
ground	1
twice	1
before	1
sowing	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
agreed	1
justifying	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
company	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
land	1
on	1
new	1
conditions	1
always	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
not	1
as	1
held	1
in	1
partnership	1
but	1
as	1
rented	1
for	1
half	1
the	1
crop	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
Ryezunov	1
himself	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
a	1
rent	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
you	1
trouble	1
and	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
free	1
Moreover	1
the	1
same	1
peasants	1
kept	1
putting	1
off	1
on	1
various	1
excuses	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
a	1
cattleyard	1
and	1
barn	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
as	1
agreed	1
upon	1
and	1
delayed	1
doing	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
winter	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
Shuraev	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
let	1
out	1
the	1
kitchen	1
gardens	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
in	1
small	1
lots	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
He	1
evidently	1
quite	1
misunderstood	1
and	1
apparently	1
intentionally	1
misunderstood	1
the	1
conditions	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
Often	1
too	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
explaining	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
heard	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
were	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
He	1
felt	1
this	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
cleverest	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
Ryezunov	1
and	1
detected	1
the	1
gleam	1
in	1
Ryezunov	1
s	1
eyes	1
which	1
showed	1
so	1
plainly	1
both	1
ironical	1
amusement	1
at	1
Levin	1
and	1
the	1
firm	1
conviction	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
he	1
Ryezunov	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
Levin	1
thought	1
the	1
system	1
worked	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
keeping	1
accounts	1
strictly	1
and	1
insisting	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
he	1
would	1
prove	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
system	1
would	1
go	1
of	1
itself	1
These	1
matters	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
still	1
left	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
the	1
indoor	1
work	1
over	1
his	1
book	1
so	1
engrossed	1
Levin	1
the	1
whole	1
summer	1
that	1
he	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
went	1
out	1
shooting	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
August	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
to	1
Moscow	1
from	1
their	1
servant	1
who	1
brought	1
back	1
the	1
side	1
saddle	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
not	1
answering	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
his	1
rudeness	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
a	1
flush	1
of	1
shame	1
burned	1
his	1
ships	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
as	1
rude	1
with	1
the	1
Sviazhskys	1
leaving	1
them	1
without	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
either	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
that	1
now	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
reorganizing	1
the	1
farming	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
absorbed	1
him	1
as	1
completely	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
He	1
read	1
the	1
books	1
lent	1
him	1
by	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
copying	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
he	1
read	1
both	1
the	1
economic	1
and	1
socialistic	1
books	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
anticipated	1
found	1
nothing	1
bearing	1
on	1
the	1
scheme	1
he	1
had	1
undertaken	1
In	1
the	1
books	1
on	1
political	1
economy	1
in	1
Mill	1
for	1
instance	1
whom	1
he	1
studied	1
first	1
with	1
great	1
ardor	1
hoping	1
every	1
minute	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
were	1
engrossing	1
him	1
he	1
found	1
laws	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
land	1
culture	1
in	1
Europe	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
these	1
laws	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
apply	1
in	1
Russia	1
must	1
be	1
general	1
He	1
saw	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
socialistic	1
books	1
either	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
beautiful	1
but	1
impracticable	1
fantasies	1
which	1
had	1
fascinated	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
student	1
or	1
they	1
were	1
attempts	1
at	1
improving	1
rectifying	1
the	1
economic	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
Europe	1
was	1
placed	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
land	1
tenure	1
in	1
Russia	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
Political	1
economy	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
Europe	1
had	1
been	1
developed	1
and	1
was	1
developing	1
were	1
universal	1
and	1
unvarying	1
Socialism	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
development	1
along	1
these	1
lines	1
leads	1
to	1
ruin	1
And	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
gave	1
an	1
answer	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
hint	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
what	1
he	1
Levin	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasants	1
and	1
landowners	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
their	1
millions	1
of	1
hands	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
acres	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
as	1
productive	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
weal	1
Having	1
once	1
taken	1
the	1
subject	1
up	1
he	1
read	1
conscientiously	1
everything	1
bearing	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
intended	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
to	1
study	1
land	1
systems	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
on	1
this	1
question	1
be	1
confronted	1
with	1
what	1
so	1
often	1
met	1
him	1
on	1
various	1
subjects	1
Often	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
idea	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
anyone	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
would	1
suddenly	1
be	1
told	1
But	1
Kauffmann	1
but	1
Jones	1
but	1
Dubois	1
but	1
Michelli	1
You	1
haven	1
t	1
read	1
them	1
they	1
ve	1
thrashed	1
that	1
question	1
out	1
thoroughly	1
He	1
saw	1
now	1
distinctly	1
that	1
Kauffmann	1
and	1
Michelli	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
He	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
Russia	1
has	1
splendid	1
land	1
splendid	1
laborers	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
certain	1
cases	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
the	1
produce	1
raised	1
by	1
the	1
laborers	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
cases	1
when	1
capital	1
is	1
applied	1
in	1
the	1
European	1
way	1
the	1
produce	1
is	1
small	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
simply	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
laborers	1
want	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
work	1
well	1
only	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
peculiar	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
antagonism	1
is	1
not	1
incidental	1
but	1
invariable	1
and	1
has	1
its	1
roots	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
spirit	1
He	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
whose	1
task	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
colonize	1
and	1
cultivate	1
vast	1
tracts	1
of	1
unoccupied	1
land	1
consciously	1
adhered	1
till	1
all	1
their	1
land	1
was	1
occupied	1
to	1
the	1
methods	1
suitable	1
to	1
their	1
purpose	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
methods	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
was	1
generally	1
supposed	1
And	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
prove	1
this	1
theoretically	1
in	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
practically	1
on	1
his	1
land	1
Chapter	1
30	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
September	1
the	1
timber	1
had	1
been	1
carted	1
for	1
building	1
the	1
cattleyard	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
allotted	1
to	1
the	1
association	1
of	1
peasants	1
and	1
the	1
butter	1
from	1
the	1
cows	1
was	1
sold	1
and	1
the	1
profits	1
divided	1
In	1
practice	1
the	1
system	1
worked	1
capitally	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
subject	1
theoretically	1
and	1
to	1
complete	1
his	1
book	1
which	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
daydreams	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
political	1
economy	1
but	1
to	1
annihilate	1
that	1
science	1
entirely	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
soil	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
tour	1
abroad	1
and	1
to	1
study	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
and	1
to	1
collect	1
conclusive	1
evidence	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
was	1
wanted	1
Levin	1
was	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
his	1
wheat	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
go	1
abroad	1
But	1
the	1
rains	1
began	1
preventing	1
the	1
harvesting	1
of	1
the	1
corn	1
and	1
potatoes	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
putting	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
all	1
work	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
the	1
wheat	1
The	1
mud	1
was	1
impassable	1
along	1
the	1
roads	1
two	1
mills	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
weather	1
got	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
On	1
the	1
30th	1
of	1
September	1
the	1
sun	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
hoping	1
for	1
fine	1
weather	1
Levin	1
began	1
making	1
final	1
preparations	1
for	1
his	1
journey	1
He	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
wheat	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
sent	1
the	1
bailiff	1
to	1
the	1
merchant	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
money	1
owing	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
himself	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
final	1
directions	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
before	1
setting	1
off	1
Having	1
finished	1
all	1
his	1
business	1
soaked	1
through	1
with	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
kept	1
running	1
down	1
the	1
leather	1
behind	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
his	1
gaiters	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
keenest	1
and	1
most	1
confident	1
temper	1
Levin	1
returned	1
homewards	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
The	1
weather	1
had	1
become	1
worse	1
than	1
ever	1
towards	1
evening	1
the	1
hail	1
lashed	1
the	1
drenched	1
mare	1
so	1
cruelly	1
that	1
she	1
went	1
along	1
sideways	1
shaking	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
but	1
Levin	1
was	1
all	1
right	1
under	1
his	1
hood	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
cheerfully	1
about	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
muddy	1
streams	1
running	1
under	1
the	1
wheels	1
at	1
the	1
drops	1
hanging	1
on	1
every	1
bare	1
twig	1
at	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
patch	1
of	1
unmelted	1
hailstones	1
on	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
the	1
thick	1
layer	1
of	1
still	1
juicy	1
fleshy	1
leaves	1
that	1
lay	1
heaped	1
up	1
about	1
the	1
stripped	1
elm	1
tree	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
gloominess	1
of	1
nature	1
around	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
peculiarly	1
eager	1
The	1
talks	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
having	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
in	1
the	1
further	1
village	1
had	1
shown	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
their	1
new	1
position	1
The	1
old	1
servant	1
to	1
whose	1
hut	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
get	1
dry	1
evidently	1
approved	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
plan	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
proposed	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
partnership	1
by	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
cattle	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
go	1
stubbornly	1
on	1
towards	1
my	1
aim	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
attain	1
my	1
end	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
something	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
take	1
trouble	1
for	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
myself	1
individually	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
welfare	1
comes	1
into	1
it	1
The	1
whole	1
system	1
of	1
culture	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
must	1
be	1
completely	1
transformed	1
Instead	1
of	1
poverty	1
general	1
prosperity	1
and	1
content	1
instead	1
of	1
hostility	1
harmony	1
and	1
unity	1
of	1
interests	1
In	1
short	1
a	1
bloodless	1
revolution	1
but	1
a	1
revolution	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
magnitude	1
beginning	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
circle	1
of	1
our	1
district	1
then	1

then	1
Russia	1
the	1

Because	1

went	1
to	1
a	1
ball	1
in	1
a	1

tie	1
and	1
was	1
refused	1
by	1

was	1

creature	1
that	1
proves	1
nothing	1
I	1
feel	1
sure	1
Franklin	1
felt	1
just	1
as	1
worthless	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
had	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
himself	1
thinking	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
That	1
means	1
nothing	1
And	1
he	1
too	1
most	1
likely	1
had	1
an	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
confided	1
his	1
secrets	1
Musing	1
on	1
such	1
thoughts	1
Levin	1
reached	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
The	1
bailiff	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
merchant	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
brought	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
wheat	1
An	1
agreement	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
bailiff	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
everywhere	1
the	1
corn	1
was	1
still	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
shocks	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
carried	1
were	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
losses	1
of	1
others	1
After	1
dinner	1
Levin	1
was	1
sitting	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
did	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
book	1
Today	1
all	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
special	1
distinctness	1
and	1
whole	1
periods	1
ranged	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
illustration	1
of	1
his	1
theories	1
I	1
must	1
write	1
that	1
down	1
he	1
thought	1
That	1
ought	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
brief	1
introduction	1
which	1
I	1
thought	1
unnecessary	1
before	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
writing	1
table	1
and	1
Laska	1
lying	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
got	1
up	1
too	1
stretching	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
inquire	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
write	1
it	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
peasants	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
and	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
them	1
After	1
his	1
levee	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
giving	1
directions	1
about	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
seeing	1
all	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
business	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
work	1
Laska	1
lay	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
settled	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
with	1
her	1
stocking	1
After	1
writing	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
Levin	1
suddenly	1
thought	1
with	1
exceptional	1
vividness	1
of	1
Kitty	1
her	1
refusal	1
and	1
their	1
last	1
meeting	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
being	1
dreary	1
said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
Come	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
stay	1
on	1
at	1
home	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
some	1
warm	1
springs	1
especially	1
now	1
you	1
re	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
Well	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
I	1
must	1
finish	1
my	1
work	1
There	1
there	1
your	1
work	1
you	1
say	1
As	1
if	1
you	1
hadn	1
t	1
done	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
peasants	1
Why	1
as	1
tis	1
they	1
re	1
saying	1
Your	1
master	1
will	1
be	1
getting	1
some	1
honor	1
from	1
the	1
Tsar	1
for	1
it	1
Indeed	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
thing	1
why	1
need	1
you	1
worry	1
about	1
the	1
peasants	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
worrying	1
about	1
them	1
I	1
m	1
doing	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
good	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
knew	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
plans	1
for	1
his	1
land	1
Levin	1
often	1
put	1
his	1
views	1
before	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
complexity	1
and	1
not	1
uncommonly	1
he	1
argued	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
her	1
comments	1
But	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
she	1
entirely	1
misinterpreted	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
Of	1
one	1
s	1
soul	1
s	1
salvation	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
and	1
must	1
think	1
before	1
all	1
else	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
Parfen	1
Denisitch	1
now	1
for	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
scholar	1
he	1
died	1
a	1
death	1
that	1
God	1
grant	1
everyone	1
of	1
us	1
the	1
like	1
she	1
said	1
referring	1
to	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
had	1
died	1
recently	1
Took	1
the	1
sacrament	1
and	1
all	1
That	1
s	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
acting	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
advantage	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
the	1
peasants	1
do	1
their	1
work	1
better	1
Well	1
whatever	1
you	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
lazy	1
good	1
for	1
nought	1
everything	1
ll	1
be	1
at	1
sixes	1
and	1
sevens	1
If	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
conscience	1
he	1
ll	1
work	1
and	1
if	1
not	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
doing	1
anything	1
Oh	1
come	1
you	1
say	1
yourself	1
Ivan	1
has	1
begun	1
looking	1
after	1
the	1
cattle	1
better	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
answered	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
evidently	1
not	1
speaking	1
at	1
random	1
but	1
in	1
strict	1
sequence	1
of	1
idea	1
that	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
get	1
married	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
subject	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
hurt	1
and	1
stung	1
him	1
Levin	1
scowled	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
her	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
work	1
Only	1
at	1
intervals	1
he	1
listened	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
to	1
the	1
click	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
needles	1
and	1
recollecting	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
remember	1
he	1
frowned	1
again	1
At	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
the	1
faint	1
vibration	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
over	1
the	1
mud	1
Well	1
here	1
s	1
visitors	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
dull	1
said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
But	1
Levin	1
overtook	1
her	1
His	1
work	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
well	1
now	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
visitor	1
whoever	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
Chapter	1
31	1
Running	1
halfway	1
down	1
the	1
staircase	1
Levin	1
caught	1
a	1
sound	1
he	1
knew	1
a	1
familiar	1
cough	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
But	1
he	1
heard	1
it	1
indistinctly	1
through	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
footsteps	1
and	1
hoped	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken	1
Then	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
bony	1
familiar	1
figure	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistake	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
hoping	1
that	1
this	1
tall	1
man	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
fur	1
cloak	1
and	1
coughing	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
loved	1
his	1
brother	1
but	1
being	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
torture	1
Just	1
now	1
when	1
Levin	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
hint	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
troubled	1
and	1
uncertain	1
humor	1
the	1
meeting	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
face	1
seemed	1
particularly	1
difficult	1
Instead	1
of	1
a	1
lively	1
healthy	1
visitor	1
some	1
outsider	1
who	1
would	1
he	1
hoped	1
cheer	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
uncertain	1
humor	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
who	1
would	1
call	1
forth	1
all	1
the	1
thoughts	1
nearest	1
his	1
heart	1
would	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
fully	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
do	1
Angry	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
so	1
base	1
a	1
feeling	1
Levin	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
brother	1
close	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
selfish	1
disappointment	1
vanished	1
instantly	1
and	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
pity	1
Terrible	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
in	1
his	1
emaciation	1
and	1
sickliness	1
now	1
he	1
looked	1
still	1
more	1
emaciated	1
still	1
more	1
wasted	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
skeleton	1
covered	1
with	1
skin	1
He	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
jerking	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
neck	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1
scarf	1
off	1
it	1
and	1
smiled	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
pitiful	1
smile	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
smile	1
submissive	1
and	1
humble	1
Levin	1
felt	1
something	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
throat	1
You	1
see	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
voice	1
never	1
for	1
one	1
second	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
face	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
but	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
unwell	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
Now	1
I	1
m	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
he	1
said	1
rubbing	1
his	1
beard	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
thin	1
hands	1
Yes	1
yes	1
answered	1
Levin	1
And	1
he	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
frightened	1
when	1
kissing	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
dryness	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
skin	1
and	1
saw	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
big	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
light	1
A	1
few	1
weeks	1
before	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
sale	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
that	1
had	1
remained	1
undivided	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
about	1
two	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
share	1
Nikolay	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
money	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
nest	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
earth	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
renew	1
his	1
strength	1
like	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
old	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
exaggerated	1
stoop	1
and	1
the	1
emaciation	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
striking	1
from	1
his	1
height	1
his	1
movements	1
were	1
as	1
rapid	1
and	1
abrupt	1
as	1
ever	1
Levin	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
His	1
brother	1
dressed	1
with	1
particular	1
care	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
do	1
combed	1
his	1
scanty	1
lank	1
hair	1
and	1
smiling	1
went	1
upstairs	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
mood	1
just	1
as	1
Levin	1
often	1
remembered	1
him	1
in	1
childhood	1
He	1
even	1
referred	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
without	1
rancor	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
he	1
made	1
jokes	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
asked	1
after	1
the	1
old	1
servants	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Parfen	1
Denisitch	1
made	1
a	1
painful	1
impression	1
on	1
him	1
A	1
look	1
of	1
fear	1
crossed	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
he	1
regained	1
his	1
serenity	1
immediately	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
old	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
Well	1
I	1
ll	1
spend	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
two	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
m	1
off	1
to	1
Moscow	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Myakov	1
has	1
promised	1
me	1
a	1
place	1
there	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
service	1
Now	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
arrange	1
my	1
life	1
quite	1
differently	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
that	1
woman	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
Why	1
what	1
for	1
Oh	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
horrid	1
woman	1
She	1
caused	1
me	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
worries	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
annoyances	1
were	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
off	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
because	1
the	1
tea	1
was	1
weak	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
because	1
she	1
would	1
look	1
after	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
an	1
invalid	1
Besides	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
turn	1
over	1
a	1
new	1
leaf	1
completely	1
now	1
I	1
ve	1
done	1
silly	1
things	1
of	1
course	1
like	1
everyone	1
else	1
but	1
money	1
s	1
the	1
last	1
consideration	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
regret	1
it	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
s	1
health	1
and	1
my	1
health	1
thank	1
God	1
is	1
quite	1
restored	1
Levin	1
listened	1
and	1
racked	1
his	1
brains	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
Nikolay	1
probably	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
began	1
questioning	1
his	1
brother	1
about	1
his	1
affairs	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
himself	1
because	1
then	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
without	1
hypocrisy	1
He	1
told	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
his	1
plans	1
and	1
his	1
doings	1
His	1
brother	1
listened	1
but	1
evidently	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
by	1
it	1
These	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
so	1
akin	1
so	1
near	1
each	1
other	1
that	1
the	1
slightest	1
gesture	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
told	1
both	1
more	1
than	1
could	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
words	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
now	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
thought	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
Nikolay	1
and	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
which	1
stifled	1
all	1
else	1
But	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
dared	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
so	1
whatever	1
they	1
said	1
not	1
uttering	1
the	1
one	1
thought	1
that	1
filled	1
their	1
minds	1
was	1
all	1
falsehood	1
Never	1
had	1
Levin	1
been	1
so	1
glad	1
when	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
Never	1
with	1
any	1
outside	1
person	1
never	1
on	1
any	1
official	1
visit	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
so	1
unnatural	1
and	1
false	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
evening	1
And	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
this	1
unnaturalness	1
and	1
the	1
remorse	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
unnatural	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
weep	1
over	1
his	1
dying	1
dearly	1
loved	1
brother	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
keep	1
on	1
talking	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
live	1
As	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
damp	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
bedroom	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
heated	1
Levin	1
put	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
bedroom	1
behind	1
a	1
screen	1
His	1
brother	1
got	1
into	1
bed	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
slept	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
tossed	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
coughed	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
throat	1
clear	1
mumbled	1
something	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
his	1
breathing	1
was	1
painful	1
he	1
said	1
Oh	1
my	1
God	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
choking	1
he	1
muttered	1
angrily	1
Ah	1
the	1
devil	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
hearing	1
him	1
His	1
thoughts	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
various	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
death	1
Death	1
the	1
inevitable	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
irresistible	1
force	1
And	1
death	1
which	1
was	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
loved	1
brother	1
groaning	1
half	1
asleep	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
calling	1
without	1
distinction	1
on	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
remote	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
hitherto	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
himself	1
too	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
If	1
not	1
today	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
not	1
tomorrow	1
in	1
thirty	1
years	1
wasn	1
t	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
this	1
inevitable	1
death	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
had	1
never	1
thought	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
power	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
work	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten	1
it	1
must	1
all	1
end	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten	1
death	1
He	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
crouched	1
up	1
hugging	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
from	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
thought	1
he	1
pondered	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
intensely	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
clearer	1
it	1
became	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
indubitably	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
reality	1
looking	1
upon	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
one	1
little	1
fact	1
that	1
death	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
all	1
ends	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
even	1
worth	1
beginning	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
helping	1
it	1
anyway	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
awful	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
alive	1
still	1
Now	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
despair	1
He	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle	1
got	1
up	1
cautiously	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
hair	1
Yes	1
there	1
were	1
gray	1
hairs	1
about	1
his	1
temples	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
His	1
back	1
teeth	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
decay	1
He	1
bared	1
his	1
muscular	1
arms	1
Yes	1
there	1
was	1
strength	1
in	1
them	1
But	1
Nikolay	1
who	1
lay	1
there	1
breathing	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
lungs	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
healthy	1
body	1
too	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
recalled	1
how	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
together	1
as	1
children	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
only	1
waited	1
till	1
Fyodor	1
Bogdanitch	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
fling	1
pillows	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
laugh	1
laugh	1
irrepressibly	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
their	1
awe	1
of	1
Fyodor	1
Bogdanitch	1
could	1
not	1
check	1
the	1
effervescing	1
overbrimming	1
sense	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
And	1
now	1
that	1
bent	1
hollow	1
chest	1
and	1
I	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me	1
or	1
wherefore	1

Damnation	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
keep	1
fidgeting	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
voice	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1

Levin	1
felt	1
withdrew	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
candle	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
The	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
live	1
had	1
hardly	1
begun	1
to	1
grow	1
a	1
little	1
clearer	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
a	1
new	1
insoluble	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
death	1
Why	1
he	1
s	1
dying	1
yes	1
he	1
ll	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
how	1
help	1
him	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
d	1
even	1
forgotten	1
that	1

was	1
at	1
all	1
Chapter	1
32	1
Levin	1
had	1
long	1
before	1
made	1
the	1
observation	1
that	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
being	1
excessively	1
amenable	1
and	1
meek	1
one	1
is	1
apt	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
to	1
find	1
things	1
intolerable	1
from	1
their	1
touchiness	1
and	1
irritability	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
And	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
s	1
gentleness	1
did	1
in	1
fact	1
not	1
last	1
out	1
for	1
long	1
The	1
very	1
next	1
morning	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
irritable	1
and	1
seemed	1
doing	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
attacking	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
tenderest	1
points	1
Levin	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
set	1
things	1
right	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
not	1
kept	1
up	1
appearances	1
but	1
had	1
spoken	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
had	1
said	1
only	1
just	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
they	1
would	1
simply	1
have	1
looked	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
faces	1
and	1
Konstantin	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
said	1
You	1
re	1
dying	1
you	1
re	1
dying	1
and	1
Nikolay	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
answered	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
m	1
dying	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
more	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
said	1
only	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
But	1
life	1
like	1
that	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
so	1
Konstantin	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
never	1
could	1
learn	1
to	1
do	1
though	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
observe	1
many	1
people	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
without	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
living	1
at	1
all	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
continually	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
falsehood	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
detected	1
him	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
exasperated	1
at	1
it	1
The	1
third	1
day	1
Nikolay	1
induced	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
plan	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
began	1
not	1
merely	1
attacking	1
it	1
but	1
intentionally	1
confounding	1
it	1
with	1
communism	1
You	1
ve	1
simply	1
borrowed	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
but	1
you	1
ve	1
distorted	1
it	1
and	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
apply	1
it	1
where	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
applicable	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
They	1
deny	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
property	1
of	1
capital	1
of	1
inheritance	1
while	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
this	1
chief	1
stimulus	1
Levin	1
felt	1
disgusted	1
himself	1
at	1
using	1
such	1
expressions	1
but	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
engrossed	1
by	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
come	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
to	1
use	1
words	1
not	1
Russian	1
All	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
to	1
regulate	1
labor	1
Which	1
means	1
you	1
ve	1
borrowed	1
an	1
idea	1
stripped	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
gave	1
it	1
its	1
force	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
something	1
new	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
angrily	1
tugging	1
at	1
his	1
necktie	1
But	1
my	1
idea	1
has	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
That	1
anyway	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile	1
his	1
eyes	1
flashing	1
malignantly	1
has	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
one	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
geometrical	1
symmetry	1
of	1
clearness	1
of	1
definiteness	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
Utopia	1
But	1
if	1
once	1
one	1
allows	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
making	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
a	1
tabula	1
rasa	1
no	1
property	1
no	1
family	1
then	1
labor	1
would	1
organize	1
itself	1
But	1
you	1
gain	1
nothing	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
mix	1
things	1
up	1
I	1
ve	1
never	1
been	1
a	1
communist	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
s	1
premature	1
but	1
rational	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
future	1
just	1
like	1
Christianity	1
in	1
its	1
first	1
ages	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
maintain	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
labor	1
force	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
investigated	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
natural	1
science	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
studied	1
its	1
qualities	1
ascertained	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
utter	1
waste	1
of	1
time	1
That	1
force	1
finds	1
a	1
certain	1
form	1
of	1
activity	1
of	1
itself	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
stage	1
of	1
its	1
development	1
There	1
have	1
been	1
slaves	1
first	1
everywhere	1
then	1
metayers	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
half	1
crop	1
system	1
rent	1
and	1
day	1
laborers	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
Levin	1
suddenly	1
lost	1
his	1
temper	1
at	1
these	1
words	1
because	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
balance	1
even	1
between	1
communism	1
and	1
the	1
familiar	1
forms	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
hardly	1
possible	1
I	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
means	1
of	1
working	1
productively	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
laborers	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
organize	1
he	1
answered	1
hotly	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
organize	1
anything	1
it	1
s	1
simply	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
all	1
your	1
life	1
that	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
original	1
to	1
pose	1
as	1
not	1
exploiting	1
the	1
peasants	1
simply	1
but	1
with	1
some	1
idea	1
in	1
view	1
Oh	1
all	1
right	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
answered	1
Levin	1
feeling	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
cheek	1
twitching	1
uncontrollably	1
You	1
ve	1
never	1
had	1
and	1
never	1
have	1
convictions	1
all	1
you	1
want	1
is	1
to	1
please	1
your	1
vanity	1
Oh	1
very	1
well	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
alone	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
high	1
time	1
I	1
did	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
sorry	1
I	1
ever	1
came	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
Levin	1
s	1
efforts	1
to	1
soothe	1
his	1
brother	1
afterwards	1
Nikolay	1
would	1
listen	1
to	1
nothing	1
he	1
said	1
declaring	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
to	1
part	1
and	1
Konstantin	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
simply	1
was	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
unbearable	1
to	1
him	1
Nikolay	1
was	1
just	1
getting	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
when	1
Konstantin	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
rather	1
unnaturally	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
hurt	1
his	1
feelings	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
Ah	1
generosity	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
that	1
satisfaction	1
You	1
re	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
at	1
parting	1
that	1
Nikolay	1
kissed	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
looking	1
with	1
sudden	1
strangeness	1
and	1
seriousness	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
Anyway	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
evil	1
against	1
me	1
Kostya	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
quivered	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
sincerely	1
between	1
them	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
those	1
words	1
meant	1
You	1
see	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
and	1
maybe	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
again	1
Levin	1
knew	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
gushed	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
He	1
kissed	1
his	1
brother	1
once	1
more	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
Three	1
days	1
after	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
departure	1
Levin	1
too	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
his	1
foreign	1
tour	1
Happening	1
to	1
meet	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
Kitty	1
s	1
cousin	1
in	1
the	1
railway	1
train	1
Levin	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
depression	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
asked	1
him	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
much	1
happiness	1
in	1
life	1
Not	1
much	1
You	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Paris	1
instead	1
of	1
to	1
Mulhausen	1
You	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
No	1
I	1
ve	1
done	1
with	1
it	1
all	1
It	1
s	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
dead	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
said	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
laughing	1
why	1
I	1
m	1
only	1
just	1
getting	1
ready	1
to	1
begin	1
Yes	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
same	1
not	1
long	1
ago	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
dead	1
Levin	1
said	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
genuinely	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
late	1
He	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
death	1
or	1
the	1
advance	1
towards	1
death	1
in	1
everything	1
But	1
his	1
cherished	1
scheme	1
only	1
engrossed	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
Life	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
through	1
somehow	1
till	1
death	1
did	1
come	1
Darkness	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
everything	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
darkness	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
guiding	1
clue	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
was	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
he	1
clutched	1
it	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
PART	1
FOUR	1
Chapter	1
1	1
The	1
Karenins	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
continued	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
met	1
every	1
day	1
but	1
were	1
complete	1
strangers	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
every	1
day	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
servants	1
might	1
have	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
suppositions	1
but	1
avoided	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
never	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
house	1
but	1
Anna	1
saw	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
The	1
position	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
misery	1
for	1
all	1
three	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
equal	1
to	1
enduring	1
this	1
position	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
day	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
expectation	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
change	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
temporary	1
painful	1
ordeal	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
over	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
hoped	1
that	1
this	1
passion	1
would	1
pass	1
as	1
everything	1
does	1
pass	1
that	1
everyone	1
would	1
forget	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
would	1
remain	1
unsullied	1
Anna	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
position	1
depended	1
and	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
miserable	1
than	1
for	1
anyone	1
endured	1
it	1
because	1
she	1
not	1
merely	1
hoped	1
but	1
firmly	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1
settled	1
and	1
come	1
right	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
idea	1
what	1
would	1
settle	1
the	1
position	1
but	1
she	1
firmly	1
believed	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
turn	1
up	1
now	1
Vronsky	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
or	1
wishes	1
followed	1
her	1
lead	1
hoped	1
too	1
that	1
something	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
action	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
solve	1
all	1
difficulties	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
Vronsky	1
spent	1
a	1
very	1
tiresome	1
week	1
A	1
foreign	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
put	1
under	1
his	1
charge	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
sights	1
worth	1
seeing	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
of	1
distinguished	1
appearance	1
he	1
possessed	1
moreover	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
behaving	1
with	1
respectful	1
dignity	1
and	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
such	1
grand	1
personages	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
duties	1
very	1
irksome	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
miss	1
nothing	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
at	1
home	1
had	1
he	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
Russia	1
And	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
enjoy	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
all	1
Russian	1
forms	1
of	1
amusement	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
guide	1
in	1
satisfying	1
both	1
these	1
inclinations	1
The	1
mornings	1
they	1
spent	1
driving	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
places	1
of	1
interest	1
the	1
evenings	1
they	1
passed	1
enjoying	1
the	1
national	1
entertainments	1
The	1
prince	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
health	1
exceptional	1
even	1
among	1
princes	1
By	1
gymnastics	1
and	1
careful	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
health	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
himself	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
excess	1
in	1
pleasure	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
fresh	1
as	1
a	1
big	1
glossy	1
green	1
Dutch	1
cucumber	1
The	1
prince	1
had	1
traveled	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
and	1
considered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
advantages	1
of	1
modern	1
facilities	1
of	1
communication	1
was	1
the	1
accessibility	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Spain	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
indulged	1
in	1
serenades	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
a	1
Spanish	1
girl	1
who	1
played	1
the	1
mandolin	1
In	1
Switzerland	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
chamois	1
In	1
England	1
he	1
had	1
galloped	1
in	1
a	1
red	1
coat	1
over	1
hedges	1
and	1
killed	1
two	1
hundred	1
pheasants	1
for	1
a	1
bet	1
In	1
Turkey	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
harem	1
in	1
India	1
he	1
had	1
hunted	1
on	1
an	1
elephant	1
and	1
now	1
in	1
Russia	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
taste	1
all	1
the	1
specially	1
Russian	1
forms	1
of	1
pleasure	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
chief	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
at	1
great	1
pains	1
to	1
arrange	1
all	1
the	1
Russian	1
amusements	1
suggested	1
by	1
various	1
persons	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
They	1
had	1
race	1
horses	1
and	1
Russian	1
pancakes	1
and	1
bear	1
hunts	1
and	1
three	1
horse	1
sledges	1
and	1
gypsies	1
and	1
drinking	1
feasts	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
broken	1
crockery	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
surprising	1
ease	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
spirit	1
smashed	1
trays	1
full	1
of	1
crockery	1
sat	1
with	1
a	1
gypsy	1
girl	1
on	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
asking	1
what	1
more	1
and	1
does	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
spirit	1
consist	1
in	1
just	1
this	1
In	1
reality	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Russian	1
entertainments	1
the	1
prince	1
liked	1
best	1
French	1
actresses	1
and	1
ballet	1
dancers	1
and	1
white	1
seal	1
champagne	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
princes	1
but	1
either	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
changed	1
of	1
late	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
too	1
close	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
week	1
seemed	1
fearfully	1
wearisome	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
week	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
sensation	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
set	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
a	1
dangerous	1
madman	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
madman	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
from	1
being	1
with	1
him	1
fearing	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
reason	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
continually	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
never	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
relaxing	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
stern	1
official	1
respectfulness	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
himself	1
be	1
insulted	1
The	1
prince	1
s	1
manner	1
of	1
treating	1
the	1
very	1
people	1
who	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
surprise	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
descend	1
to	1
any	1
depths	1
to	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
Russian	1
amusements	1
was	1
contemptuous	1
His	1
criticisms	1
of	1
Russian	1
women	1
whom	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
study	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
made	1
Vronsky	1
crimson	1
with	1
indignation	1
The	1
chief	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
so	1
particularly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
himself	1
in	1
him	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
mirror	1
did	1
not	1
gratify	1
his	1
self	1
esteem	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
stupid	1
and	1
very	1
self	1
satisfied	1
and	1
very	1
healthy	1
and	1
very	1
well	1
washed	1
man	1
and	1
nothing	1
else	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
that	1
was	1
true	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
deny	1
it	1
He	1
was	1
equable	1
and	1
not	1
cringing	1
with	1
his	1
superiors	1
was	1
free	1
and	1
ingratiating	1
in	1
his	1
behavior	1
with	1
his	1
equals	1
and	1
was	1
contemptuously	1
indulgent	1
with	1
his	1
inferiors	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
regarded	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
merit	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
But	1
for	1
this	1
prince	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
inferior	1
and	1
his	1
contemptuous	1
and	1
indulgent	1
attitude	1
to	1
him	1
revolted	1
him	1
Brainless	1
beef	1
can	1
I	1
be	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
Be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
parted	1
from	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
was	1
starting	1
for	1
Moscow	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
thanks	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
his	1
uncomfortable	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
reflection	1
of	1
himself	1
He	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
on	1
their	1
return	1
from	1
a	1
bear	1
hunt	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
display	1
of	1
Russian	1
prowess	1
kept	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
Chapter	1
2	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
Vronsky	1
found	1
there	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Anna	1
She	1
wrote	1
I	1
am	1
ill	1
and	1
unhappy	1
I	1
cannot	1
come	1
out	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
longer	1
without	1
seeing	1
you	1
Come	1
in	1
this	1
evening	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
council	1
at	1
seven	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
there	1
till	1
ten	1
Thinking	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
her	1
bidding	1
him	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
insisting	1
on	1
her	1
not	1
receiving	1
him	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
that	1
winter	1
got	1
his	1
promotion	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
colonel	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
regimental	1
quarters	1
and	1
was	1
living	1
alone	1
After	1
having	1
some	1
lunch	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
immediately	1
and	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
memories	1
of	1
the	1
hideous	1
scenes	1
he	1
had	1
witnessed	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
were	1
confused	1
together	1
and	1
joined	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
mental	1
image	1
of	1
Anna	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
played	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
bear	1
hunt	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
fell	1
asleep	1
He	1
waked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
trembling	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
candle	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
What	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
dreadful	1
thing	1
I	1
dreamed	1
Yes	1
yes	1
I	1
think	1
a	1
little	1
dirty	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
disheveled	1
beard	1
was	1
stooping	1
down	1
doing	1
something	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
he	1
began	1
saying	1
some	1
strange	1
words	1
in	1
French	1
Yes	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
But	1
why	1
was	1
it	1
so	1
awful	1
He	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
peasant	1
again	1
and	1
those	1
incomprehensible	1
French	1
words	1
the	1
peasant	1
had	1
uttered	1
and	1
a	1
chill	1
of	1
horror	1
ran	1
down	1
his	1
spine	1
What	1
nonsense	1
thought	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
It	1
was	1
half	1
past	1
eight	1
already	1
He	1
rang	1
up	1
his	1
servant	1
dressed	1
in	1
haste	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
the	1
dream	1
and	1
only	1
worried	1
at	1
being	1
late	1
As	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Karenins	1
entrance	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
nine	1
A	1
high	1
narrow	1
carriage	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
grays	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
He	1
recognized	1
Anna	1
s	1
carriage	1
She	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
thought	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
better	1
she	1
should	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
going	1
into	1
that	1
house	1
But	1
no	1
matter	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
hide	1
myself	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
manner	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
childhood	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sledge	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
rug	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
called	1
the	1
carriage	1
Vronsky	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
usually	1
notice	1
details	1
noticed	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
amazed	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
porter	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
doorway	1
Vronsky	1
almost	1
ran	1
up	1
against	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
The	1
gas	1
jet	1
threw	1
its	1
full	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
bloodless	1
sunken	1
face	1
under	1
the	1
black	1
hat	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
cravat	1
brilliant	1
against	1
the	1
beaver	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
Karenin	1
s	1
fixed	1
dull	1
eyes	1
were	1
fastened	1
upon	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
Vronsky	1
bowed	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
chewing	1
his	1
lips	1
lifted	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
him	1
without	1
looking	1
round	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
disappear	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
His	1
brows	1
were	1
scowling	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
with	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
angry	1
light	1
in	1
them	1
What	1
a	1
position	1
he	1
thought	1
If	1
he	1
would	1
fight	1
would	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
his	1
honor	1
I	1
could	1
act	1
could	1
express	1
my	1
feelings	1
but	1
this	1
weakness	1
or	1
baseness	1
He	1
puts	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
playing	1
false	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
meant	1
and	1
never	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
ideas	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
Anna	1
in	1
the	1
Vrede	1
garden	1
Unconsciously	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
Anna	1
who	1
had	1
surrendered	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
utterly	1
and	1
simply	1
looked	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
decide	1
her	1
fate	1
ready	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
anything	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
their	1
tie	1
might	1
end	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
then	1
His	1
ambitious	1
plans	1
had	1
retreated	1
into	1
the	1
background	1
again	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
circle	1
of	1
activity	1
in	1
which	1
everything	1
was	1
definite	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
himself	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
passion	1
and	1
that	1
passion	1
was	1
binding	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
closely	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
when	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
retreating	1
footsteps	1
He	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
him	1
had	1
listened	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
No	1
she	1
cried	1
on	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
No	1
if	1
things	1
are	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
the	1
end	1
will	1
come	1
much	1
much	1
too	1
soon	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
dear	1
one	1
What	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
waiting	1
in	1
agony	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
two	1
hours	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
quarrel	1
with	1
you	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
couldn	1
t	1
come	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
She	1
laid	1
her	1
two	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
looked	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
profound	1
passionate	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
searching	1
look	1
She	1
was	1
studying	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
making	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
incomparably	1
superior	1
impossible	1
in	1
reality	1
fit	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
Chapter	1
3	1
You	1
met	1
him	1
she	1
asked	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
lamplight	1
You	1
re	1
punished	1
you	1
see	1
for	1
being	1
late	1
Yes	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
Wasn	1
t	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
somewhere	1
again	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
no	1
matter	1
Don	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
Where	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
With	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
She	1
knew	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
had	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
thrilled	1
and	1
rapturous	1
face	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
report	1
on	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
departure	1
But	1
it	1
s	1
over	1
now	1
He	1
is	1
gone	1
Thank	1
God	1
it	1
s	1
over	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
insufferable	1
it	1
s	1
been	1
for	1
me	1
Why	1
so	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
the	1
life	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
all	1
young	1
men	1
always	1
lead	1
she	1
said	1
knitting	1
her	1
brows	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
crochet	1
work	1
that	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
began	1
drawing	1
the	1
hook	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
gave	1
that	1
life	1
up	1
long	1
ago	1
said	1
he	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
divine	1
its	1
meaning	1
And	1
I	1
confess	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
showing	1
his	1
thick	1
white	1
teeth	1
this	1
week	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
seeing	1
that	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
like	1
it	1
She	1
held	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
crochet	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
strange	1
shining	1
and	1
hostile	1
eyes	1
This	1
morning	1
Liza	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
me	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
she	1
put	1
in	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
Athenian	1
evening	1
How	1
loathsome	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
She	1
interrupted	1
him	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
Th'er`ese	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
How	1
disgusting	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
men	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angry	1
and	1
so	1
letting	1
him	1
see	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
irritation	1
especially	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
cannot	1
know	1
your	1
life	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
ever	1
known	1
she	1
said	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
And	1
how	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
whether	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
truth	1
Anna	1
you	1
hurt	1
me	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
trust	1
me	1
Haven	1
t	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
a	1
thought	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
lay	1
bare	1
to	1
you	1
Yes	1
yes	1
she	1
said	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
suppress	1
her	1
jealous	1
thoughts	1
But	1
if	1
only	1
you	1
knew	1
how	1
wretched	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
What	1
were	1
you	1
saying	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
recall	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
These	1
fits	1
of	1
jealousy	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequent	1
with	1
her	1
horrified	1
him	1
and	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
disguise	1
the	1
fact	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
although	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
jealousy	1
was	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
How	1
often	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
her	1
love	1
was	1
happiness	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
can	1
love	1
when	1
love	1
has	1
outweighed	1
for	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
further	1
from	1
happiness	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
followed	1
her	1
from	1
Moscow	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
himself	1
unhappy	1
but	1
happiness	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
happiness	1
was	1
already	1
left	1
behind	1
She	1
was	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
saw	1
her	1
Both	1
morally	1
and	1
physically	1
she	1
had	1
changed	1
for	1
the	1
worse	1
She	1
had	1
broadened	1
out	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
actress	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
expression	1
of	1
hatred	1
that	1
distorted	1
it	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
faded	1
flower	1
he	1
has	1
gathered	1
with	1
difficulty	1
recognizing	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
beauty	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
picked	1
and	1
ruined	1
it	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
then	1
when	1
his	1
love	1
was	1
stronger	1
he	1
could	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
greatly	1
wished	1
it	1
have	1
torn	1
that	1
love	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
now	1
when	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
broken	1
Well	1
well	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
prince	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
away	1
the	1
fiend	1
she	1
added	1
The	1
fiend	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
jealousy	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
begin	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
prince	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
so	1
tiresome	1
Oh	1
it	1
was	1
intolerable	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
his	1
interrupted	1
thought	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
improve	1
on	1
closer	1
acquaintance	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
him	1
defined	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prime	1
well	1
fed	1
beast	1
such	1
as	1
takes	1
medals	1
at	1
the	1
cattle	1
shows	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
vexation	1
that	1
interested	1
her	1
No	1
how	1
so	1
she	1
replied	1
He	1
s	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
anyway	1
he	1
s	1
cultured	1
It	1
s	1
an	1
utterly	1
different	1
culture	1
their	1
culture	1
He	1
s	1
cultivated	1
one	1
sees	1
simply	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
despise	1
culture	1
as	1
they	1
despise	1
everything	1
but	1
animal	1
pleasures	1
But	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
all	1
care	1
for	1
these	1
animal	1
pleasures	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
noticed	1
a	1
dark	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
avoided	1
him	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
defending	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
defending	1
him	1
it	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
imagine	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
cared	1
for	1
those	1
pleasures	1
yourself	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
affords	1
you	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
gaze	1
at	1
Th'er`ese	1
in	1
the	1
attire	1
of	1
Eve	1
Again	1
the	1
devil	1
again	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
taking	1
the	1
hand	1
she	1
had	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
Yes	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
waiting	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
here	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
away	1
somewhere	1
leading	1
your	1
life	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
me	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
pulled	1
the	1
hook	1
at	1
last	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crochet	1
work	1
and	1
rapidly	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
her	1
forefinger	1
began	1
working	1
loop	1
after	1
loop	1
of	1
the	1
wool	1
that	1
was	1
dazzling	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
lamplight	1
while	1
the	1
slender	1
wrist	1
moved	1
swiftly	1
nervously	1
in	1
the	1
embroidered	1
cuff	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
then	1
Where	1
did	1
you	1
meet	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
and	1
jarring	1
tone	1
We	1
ran	1
up	1
against	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
you	1
like	1
this	1
She	1
drew	1
a	1
long	1
face	1
and	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
quickly	1
transformed	1
her	1
expression	1
folded	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
beautiful	1
face	1
the	1
very	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
bowed	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
smiled	1
while	1
she	1
laughed	1
gaily	1
with	1
that	1
sweet	1
deep	1
laugh	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
greatest	1
charms	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
If	1
after	1
your	1
avowal	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
your	1
country	1
house	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
with	1
you	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
me	1
out	1
but	1
this	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
How	1
can	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
He	1
feels	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
evident	1
He	1
she	1
said	1
sneeringly	1
He	1
s	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
What	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
miserable	1
for	1
when	1
everything	1
might	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
Only	1
not	1
he	1
Don	1
t	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
the	1
falsity	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
s	1
utterly	1
steeped	1
Could	1
one	1
with	1
any	1
feeling	1
live	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
living	1
with	1
me	1
He	1
understands	1
nothing	1
and	1
feels	1
nothing	1
Could	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
any	1
feeling	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
his	1
unfaithful	1
wife	1
Could	1
he	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
call	1
her	1
my	1
dear	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
mimicking	1
him	1
Anna	1
ma	1
ch`ere	1
Anna	1
dear	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
doll	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
Oh	1
if	1
I	1
d	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
I	1
d	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
killed	1
have	1
torn	1
to	1
pieces	1
a	1
wife	1
like	1
me	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
have	1
said	1
Anna	1
ma	1
ch`ere	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
official	1
machine	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
your	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
outside	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
superfluous	1
Don	1
t	1
let	1
s	1
talk	1
of	1
him	1
You	1
re	1
unfair	1
very	1
unfair	1
dearest	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
But	1
never	1
mind	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
s	1
talk	1
of	1
him	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
doing	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
What	1
has	1
been	1
wrong	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
doctor	1
say	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
mocking	1
amusement	1
Evidently	1
she	1
had	1
hit	1
on	1
other	1
absurd	1
and	1
grotesque	1
aspects	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
was	1
awaiting	1
the	1
moment	1
to	1
give	1
expression	1
to	1
them	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
illness	1
but	1
your	1
condition	1
When	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
The	1
ironical	1
light	1
died	1
away	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
a	1
different	1
smile	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
something	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
and	1
of	1
quiet	1
melancholy	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
Soon	1
soon	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
our	1
position	1
is	1
miserable	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
how	1
terrible	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
love	1
you	1
freely	1
and	1
boldly	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
torture	1
myself	1
and	1
torture	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
jealousy	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
soon	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
expect	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
she	1
seemed	1
so	1
pitiable	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
She	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sleeve	1
dazzling	1
and	1
white	1
with	1
its	1
rings	1
in	1
the	1
lamplight	1
It	1
won	1
t	1
come	1
as	1
we	1
suppose	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
you	1
ve	1
made	1
me	1
Soon	1
soon	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
over	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
all	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
suffer	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
he	1
said	1
understanding	1
her	1
You	1
asked	1
when	1
Soon	1
And	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
live	1
through	1
it	1
Don	1
t	1
interrupt	1
me	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
speak	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
I	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
and	1
release	1
myself	1
and	1
you	1
Tears	1
dropped	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
he	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
it	1
trying	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
emotion	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
had	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
grounds	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
it	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
tightly	1
gripping	1
his	1
hand	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
left	1
us	1
He	1
had	1
recovered	1
himself	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
How	1
absurd	1
What	1
absurd	1
nonsense	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
What	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
That	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
A	1
dream	1
repeated	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
instantly	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
peasant	1
of	1
his	1
dream	1
Yes	1
a	1
dream	1
she	1
said	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
since	1
I	1
dreamed	1
it	1
I	1
dreamed	1
that	1
I	1
ran	1
into	1
my	1
bedroom	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
there	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
something	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
dreams	1
she	1
said	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
stood	1
something	1
Oh	1
what	1
nonsense	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
believe	1
But	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
interrupt	1
her	1
What	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
too	1
important	1
to	1
her	1
And	1
the	1
something	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
disheveled	1
beard	1
little	1
and	1
dreadful	1
looking	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
but	1
he	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
a	1
sack	1
and	1
was	1
fumbling	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
She	1
showed	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
moved	1
his	1
hands	1
There	1
was	1
terror	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
And	1
Vronsky	1
remembering	1
his	1
dream	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
terror	1
filling	1
his	1
soul	1
He	1
was	1
fumbling	1
and	1
kept	1
talking	1
quickly	1
quickly	1
in	1
French	1
you	1
know	1
Il	1
faut	1
le	1
battre	1
le	1
fer	1
le	1
broyer	1
le	1
p'etrir	1
And	1
in	1
my	1
horror	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
wake	1
up	1
and	1
woke	1
up	1
but	1
woke	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
dream	1
And	1
I	1
began	1
asking	1
myself	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
And	1
Korney	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
In	1
childbirth	1
you	1
ll	1
die	1
ma	1
am	1
you	1
ll	1
die	1
And	1
I	1
woke	1
up	1
What	1
nonsense	1
what	1
nonsense	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
conviction	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
But	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
s	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
Ring	1
the	1
bell	1
I	1
ll	1
have	1
tea	1
And	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
long	1
I	1
shall	1
But	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
stopped	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
instantaneously	1
changed	1
Horror	1
and	1
excitement	1
were	1
suddenly	1
replaced	1
by	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
soft	1
solemn	1
blissful	1
attention	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
She	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
stirring	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
life	1
within	1
her	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
after	1
meeting	1
Vronsky	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
steps	1
drove	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
the	1
Italian	1
opera	1
He	1
sat	1
through	1
two	1
acts	1
there	1
and	1
saw	1
everyone	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
On	1
returning	1
home	1
he	1
carefully	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
hat	1
stand	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
there	1
he	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
But	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
habit	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
he	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
study	1
till	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
furious	1
anger	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
observe	1
the	1
proprieties	1
and	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
stipulation	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
on	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
lover	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
home	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
peace	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
complied	1
with	1
his	1
request	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
punish	1
her	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
threat	1
obtain	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
son	1
He	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
connected	1
with	1
this	1
course	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
must	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
threat	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
hinted	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
obtaining	1
of	1
divorces	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
such	1
perfection	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
overcoming	1
the	1
formal	1
difficulties	1
Misfortunes	1
never	1
come	1
singly	1
and	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
reorganization	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
irrigation	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
the	1
Zaraisky	1
province	1
had	1
brought	1
such	1
official	1
worries	1
upon	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
late	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
condition	1
of	1
extreme	1
irritability	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
the	1
whole	1
night	1
and	1
his	1
fury	1
growing	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
vast	1
arithmetical	1
progression	1
reached	1
its	1
highest	1
limits	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
He	1
dressed	1
in	1
haste	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
carrying	1
his	1
cup	1
full	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
fearing	1
to	1
spill	1
any	1
over	1
fearing	1
to	1
lose	1
with	1
his	1
wrath	1
the	1
energy	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
directly	1
he	1
heard	1
she	1
was	1
up	1
Anna	1
who	1
had	1
thought	1
she	1
knew	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
well	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
appearance	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
His	1
brow	1
was	1
lowering	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
stared	1
darkly	1
before	1
him	1
avoiding	1
her	1
eyes	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
tightly	1
and	1
contemptuously	1
shut	1
In	1
his	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
gestures	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
determination	1
and	1
firmness	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
without	1
greeting	1
her	1
walked	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
writing	1
table	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
keys	1
opened	1
a	1
drawer	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
she	1
cried	1
Your	1
lover	1
s	1
letters	1
he	1
said	1
They	1
re	1
not	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
shutting	1
the	1
drawer	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
action	1
he	1
saw	1
he	1
had	1
guessed	1
right	1
and	1
roughly	1
pushing	1
away	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
quickly	1
snatched	1
a	1
portfolio	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
most	1
important	1
papers	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
pull	1
the	1
portfolio	1
away	1
but	1
he	1
pushed	1
her	1
back	1
Sit	1
down	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
putting	1
the	1
portfolio	1
under	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
squeezing	1
it	1
so	1
tightly	1
with	1
his	1
elbow	1
that	1
his	1
shoulder	1
stood	1
up	1
Amazed	1
and	1
intimidated	1
she	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
you	1
to	1
receive	1
your	1
lover	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
to	1
She	1
stopped	1
not	1
finding	1
a	1
reason	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
why	1
a	1
woman	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
lover	1
I	1
meant	1
I	1
only	1
she	1
said	1
flushing	1
hotly	1
This	1
coarseness	1
of	1
his	1
angered	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
courage	1
Surely	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
insult	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
An	1
honest	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
honest	1
woman	1
may	1
be	1
insulted	1
but	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
thief	1

a	1

This	1
cruelty	1
is	1
something	1
new	1
I	1
did	1
not	1

in	1

You	1
call	1

cruelty	1
for	1
a	1
husband	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
wife	1
liberty	1
giving	1
her	1
the	1
honorable	1
protection	1
of	1

name	1

on	1
the	1

of	1
observing	1

Anna	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
hatred	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
No	1
he	1
shrieked	1
in	1
his	1
shrill	1
voice	1
which	1
pitched	1
a	1
note	1
higher	1
than	1
usual	1
even	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
hands	1
clutching	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
so	1
violently	1
that	1
red	1
marks	1
were	1
left	1
from	1
the	1
bracelet	1
he	1
was	1
squeezing	1
he	1
forcibly	1
sat	1
her	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
Base	1
If	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
use	1
that	1
word	1
what	1
is	1
base	1
is	1
to	1
forsake	1
husband	1
and	1
child	1
for	1
a	1
lover	1
while	1
you	1
eat	1
your	1
husband	1
s	1
bread	1
She	1
bowed	1
her	1
head	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
to	1
her	1
lover	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
superfluous	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
that	1
She	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
only	1
said	1
softly	1
You	1
cannot	1
describe	1
my	1
position	1
as	1
worse	1
than	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
myself	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
all	1
this	1
for	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
saying	1
it	1
for	1
what	1
for	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
angrily	1
That	1
you	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
carried	1
out	1
my	1
wishes	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
observing	1
outward	1
decorum	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
Soon	1
very	1
soon	1
it	1
will	1
end	1
anyway	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
now	1
desired	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
It	1
will	1
end	1
sooner	1
than	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
lover	1
have	1
planned	1
If	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
animal	1
passion	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
generous	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman	1
to	1
strike	1
anyone	1
who	1
s	1
down	1
Yes	1
you	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
yourself	1
But	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
your	1
husband	1
have	1
no	1
interest	1
for	1
you	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
is	1
ruined	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
thuff	1
thuff	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
speaking	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
he	1
stammered	1
and	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
articulate	1
the	1
word	1
suffering	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
pronounced	1
it	1
thuffering	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
laugh	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
ashamed	1
that	1
anything	1
could	1
amuse	1
her	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
him	1
put	1
herself	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
But	1
what	1
could	1
she	1
say	1
or	1
do	1
Her	1
head	1
sank	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
silent	1
He	1
too	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
frigid	1
less	1
shrill	1
voice	1
emphasizing	1
random	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
special	1
significance	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
She	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
No	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
fancy	1
she	1
thought	1
recalling	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
when	1
he	1
stumbled	1
over	1
the	1
word	1
suffering	1
No	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
those	1
dull	1
eyes	1
with	1
that	1
self	1
satisfied	1
complacency	1
feel	1
anything	1
I	1
cannot	1
change	1
anything	1
she	1
whispered	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
receive	1
notice	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
decide	1
through	1
the	1
lawyer	1
into	1
whose	1
hands	1
I	1
shall	1
intrust	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
divorce	1
My	1
son	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1
s	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
recalling	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
his	1
son	1
You	1
take	1
Seryozha	1
to	1
hurt	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
him	1
Leave	1
me	1
Seryozha	1
Yes	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
even	1
my	1
affection	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
repulsion	1
I	1
feel	1
for	1
you	1
But	1
still	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
Good	1
bye	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
detained	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
leave	1
me	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
whispered	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
say	1
Leave	1
Seryozha	1
till	1
my	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
confined	1
leave	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
and	1
snatching	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
Chapter	1
5	1
The	1
waiting	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
lawyer	1
was	1
full	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
entered	1
it	1
Three	1
ladies	1
an	1
old	1
lady	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
a	1
merchant	1
s	1
wife	1
and	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
one	1
a	1
German	1
banker	1
with	1
a	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
finger	1
the	1
second	1
a	1
merchant	1
with	1
a	1
beard	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
a	1
wrathful	1
looking	1
government	1
clerk	1
in	1
official	1
uniform	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
had	1
obviously	1
been	1
waiting	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
already	1
Two	1
clerks	1
were	1
writing	1
at	1
tables	1
with	1
scratching	1
pens	1
The	1
appurtenances	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
tables	1
about	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
himself	1
very	1
fastidious	1
were	1
exceptionally	1
good	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
observing	1
this	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
clerks	1
without	1
getting	1
up	1
turned	1
wrathfully	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
half	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
wanting	1
He	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
lawyer	1
on	1
some	1
business	1
He	1
is	1
engaged	1
the	1
clerk	1
responded	1
severely	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
at	1
the	1
persons	1
waiting	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
writing	1
Can	1
t	1
he	1
spare	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
He	1
has	1
no	1
time	1
free	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
busy	1
Kindly	1
wait	1
your	1
turn	1
Then	1
I	1
must	1
trouble	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
my	1
card	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
with	1
dignity	1
seeing	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
preserving	1
his	1
incognito	1
The	1
clerk	1
took	1
the	1
card	1
and	1
obviously	1
not	1
approving	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
read	1
on	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
in	1
principle	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
publicity	1
of	1
legal	1
proceedings	1
though	1
for	1
some	1
higher	1
official	1
considerations	1
he	1
disliked	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
in	1
Russia	1
and	1
disapproved	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
disapprove	1
of	1
anything	1
instituted	1
by	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
His	1
whole	1
life	1
had	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
administrative	1
work	1
and	1
consequently	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
anything	1
his	1
disapproval	1
was	1
softened	1
by	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
inevitability	1
of	1
mistakes	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
reform	1
in	1
every	1
department	1
In	1
the	1
new	1
public	1
law	1
courts	1
he	1
disliked	1
the	1
restrictions	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
lawyers	1
conducting	1
cases	1
But	1
till	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
courts	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
disapproved	1
of	1
their	1
publicity	1
simply	1
in	1
theory	1
now	1
his	1
disapprobation	1
was	1
strengthened	1
by	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
waiting	1
room	1
Coming	1
immediately	1
said	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
two	1
minutes	1
later	1
there	1
did	1
actually	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
large	1
figure	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
solicitor	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
consulting	1
with	1
the	1
lawyer	1
himself	1
The	1
lawyer	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
squat	1
bald	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
dark	1
reddish	1
beard	1
light	1
colored	1
long	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
an	1
overhanging	1
brow	1
He	1
was	1
attired	1
as	1
though	1
for	1
a	1
wedding	1
from	1
his	1
cravat	1
to	1
his	1
double	1
watch	1
chain	1
and	1
varnished	1
boots	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
clever	1
and	1
manly	1
but	1
his	1
dress	1
was	1
dandified	1
and	1
in	1
bad	1
taste	1
Pray	1
walk	1
in	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
addressing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
gloomily	1
ushering	1
Karenin	1
in	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
Won	1
t	1
you	1
sit	1
down	1
He	1
indicated	1
an	1
armchair	1
at	1
a	1
writing	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
papers	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
himself	1
and	1
rubbing	1
his	1
little	1
hands	1
with	1
short	1
fingers	1
covered	1
with	1
white	1
hairs	1
he	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
settled	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
a	1
moth	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
The	1
lawyer	1
with	1
a	1
swiftness	1
that	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
opened	1
his	1
hands	1
caught	1
the	1
moth	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
former	1
attitude	1
Before	1
beginning	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
business	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
following	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
movements	1
with	1
wondering	1
eyes	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
about	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
strictly	1
private	1
The	1
lawyer	1
s	1
overhanging	1
reddish	1
mustaches	1
were	1
parted	1
in	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
lawyer	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
secrets	1
confided	1
to	1
me	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
proof	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
shrewd	1
gray	1
eyes	1
were	1
laughing	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
already	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
name	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
resumed	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
again	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
moth	1
work	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
like	1
every	1
Russian	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
bowing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
plucking	1
up	1
his	1
courage	1
But	1
having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
shrill	1
voice	1
without	1
timidity	1
or	1
hesitation	1
accentuating	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
word	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
misfortune	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
deceived	1
in	1
my	1
married	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
by	1
legal	1
means	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
divorced	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
may	1
not	1
remain	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
The	1
lawyer	1
s	1
gray	1
eyes	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
laugh	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
dancing	1
with	1
irrepressible	1
glee	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
got	1
a	1
profitable	1
job	1
there	1
was	1
triumph	1
and	1
joy	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gleam	1
like	1
the	1
malignant	1
gleam	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
eyes	1
You	1
desire	1
my	1
assistance	1
in	1
securing	1
a	1
divorce	1
Yes	1
precisely	1
so	1
but	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
wasting	1
your	1
time	1
and	1
attention	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
simply	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
preliminary	1
step	1
I	1
want	1
a	1
divorce	1
but	1
the	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
consequence	1
to	1
me	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
possible	1
that	1
if	1
that	1
form	1
does	1
not	1
correspond	1
with	1
my	1
requirements	1
I	1
may	1
give	1
up	1
a	1
legal	1
divorce	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
always	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
decide	1
He	1
let	1
his	1
eyes	1
rest	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
feet	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
offend	1
his	1
client	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
irrepressible	1
amusement	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
moth	1
that	1
flew	1
before	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
moved	1
his	1
hands	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
catch	1
it	1
from	1
regard	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
position	1
Though	1
in	1
their	1
general	1
features	1
our	1
laws	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
pursued	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
forms	1
in	1
which	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
practice	1
You	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
the	1
lawyer	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
responded	1
adopting	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
client	1
s	1
remarks	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
methods	1
by	1
which	1
you	1
could	1
secure	1
what	1
you	1
desire	1
And	1
on	1
receiving	1
an	1
assuring	1
nod	1
from	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
stealing	1
a	1
glance	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
growing	1
red	1
in	1
patches	1
Divorce	1
by	1
our	1
laws	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
shade	1
of	1
disapprobation	1
of	1
our	1
laws	1
is	1
possible	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
cases	1
Wait	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
a	1
clerk	1
who	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
but	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
In	1
the	1
following	1
cases	1
physical	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
married	1
parties	1
desertion	1
without	1
communication	1
for	1
five	1
years	1
he	1
said	1
crooking	1
a	1
short	1
finger	1
covered	1
with	1
hair	1
adultery	1
this	1
word	1
he	1
pronounced	1
with	1
obvious	1
satisfaction	1
subdivided	1
as	1
follows	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
crook	1
his	1
fat	1
fingers	1
though	1
the	1
three	1
cases	1
and	1
their	1
subdivisions	1
could	1
obviously	1
not	1
be	1
classified	1
together	1
physical	1
defect	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
adultery	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
As	1
by	1
now	1
all	1
his	1
fingers	1
were	1
used	1
up	1
he	1
uncrooked	1
all	1
his	1
fingers	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
theoretical	1
view	1
but	1
I	1
imagine	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
learn	1
its	1
application	1
in	1
practice	1
And	1
therefore	1
guided	1
by	1
precedents	1
I	1
must	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
practice	1
cases	1
of	1
divorce	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
physical	1
defect	1
I	1
may	1
assume	1
nor	1
desertion	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
assent	1
May	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
adultery	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
married	1
parties	1
and	1
the	1
detection	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
party	1
by	1
mutual	1
agreement	1
and	1
failing	1
such	1
agreement	1
accidental	1
detection	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
case	1
is	1
rarely	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
practice	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
stealing	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
he	1
paused	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
selling	1
pistols	1
after	1
enlarging	1
on	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
each	1
weapon	1
might	1
await	1
his	1
customer	1
s	1
choice	1
But	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
therefore	1
the	1
lawyer	1
went	1
on	1
The	1
most	1
usual	1
and	1
simple	1
the	1
sensible	1
course	1
I	1
consider	1
is	1
adultery	1
by	1
mutual	1
consent	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
permit	1
myself	1
to	1
express	1
it	1
so	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
no	1
education	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
to	1
you	1
this	1
is	1
comprehensible	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
however	1
so	1
perturbed	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
immediately	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
of	1
adultery	1
by	1
mutual	1
consent	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
expressed	1
this	1
uncertainty	1
but	1
the	1
lawyer	1
promptly	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
assistance	1
People	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
together	1
here	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
fact	1
And	1
if	1
both	1
are	1
agreed	1
about	1
it	1
the	1
details	1
and	1
formalities	1
become	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
certain	1
method	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
fully	1
understood	1
now	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
religious	1
scruples	1
which	1
hindered	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
plan	1
That	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
he	1
said	1
Only	1
one	1
alternative	1
is	1
possible	1
undesigned	1
detection	1
supported	1
by	1
letters	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
At	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
letters	1
the	1
lawyer	1
pursed	1
up	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
gave	1
utterance	1
to	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
compassionate	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
sound	1
Kindly	1
consider	1
he	1
began	1
cases	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
are	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
aware	1
under	1
ecclesiastical	1
jurisdiction	1
the	1
reverend	1
fathers	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
betrayed	1
his	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
reverend	1
fathers	1
taste	1
Letters	1
may	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
a	1
partial	1
confirmation	1
but	1
detection	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
direct	1
kind	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
eyewitnesses	1
In	1
fact	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
intrust	1
your	1
confidence	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
If	1
one	1
wants	1
the	1
result	1
one	1
must	1
admit	1
the	1
means	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
began	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
white	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
lawyer	1
rose	1
and	1
again	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
intruding	1
clerk	1
Tell	1
her	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
haggle	1
over	1
fees	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
he	1
caught	1
unobserved	1
another	1
moth	1
Nice	1
state	1
my	1
rep	1
curtains	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
summer	1
he	1
thought	1
frowning	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
communicate	1
my	1
decision	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
letter	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
clutched	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
After	1
standing	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
silence	1
he	1
said	1
From	1
your	1
words	1
I	1
may	1
consequently	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
divorce	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
what	1
are	1
your	1
terms	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
complete	1
liberty	1
of	1
action	1
said	1
the	1
lawyer	1
not	1
answering	1
his	1
question	1
When	1
can	1
I	1
reckon	1
on	1
receiving	1
information	1
from	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
moving	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
varnished	1
boots	1
shining	1
In	1
a	1
week	1
s	1
time	1
Your	1
answer	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
you	1
will	1
undertake	1
to	1
conduct	1
the	1
case	1
and	1
on	1
what	1
terms	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
me	1
Very	1
good	1
The	1
lawyer	1
bowed	1
respectfully	1
let	1
his	1
client	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
left	1
alone	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
amusement	1
He	1
felt	1
so	1
mirthful	1
that	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
rules	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
reduction	1
in	1
his	1
terms	1
to	1
the	1
haggling	1
lady	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
catching	1
moths	1
finally	1
deciding	1
that	1
next	1
winter	1
he	1
must	1
have	1

furniture	1

Chapter	1
6	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory	1
at	1
the	1
sitting	1
of	1
the	1
Commission	1
of	1
the	1
17th	1
of	1
August	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
sequel	1
this	1
victory	1
cut	1
the	1
ground	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
The	1
new	1
commission	1
for	1
the	1
inquiry	1
into	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
branches	1
had	1
been	1
formed	1
and	1
despatched	1
to	1
its	1
destination	1
with	1
an	1
unusual	1
speed	1
and	1
energy	1
inspired	1
by	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Within	1
three	1
months	1
a	1
report	1
was	1
presented	1
The	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
was	1
investigated	1
in	1
its	1
political	1
administrative	1
economic	1
ethnographic	1
material	1
and	1
religious	1
aspects	1
To	1
all	1
these	1
questions	1
there	1
were	1
answers	1
admirably	1
stated	1
and	1
answers	1
admitting	1
no	1
shade	1
of	1
doubt	1
since	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
product	1
of	1
human	1
thought	1
always	1
liable	1
to	1
error	1
but	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
official	1
activity	1
The	1
answers	1
were	1
all	1
based	1
on	1
official	1
data	1
furnished	1
by	1
governors	1
and	1
heads	1
of	1
churches	1
and	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
district	1
magistrates	1
and	1
ecclesiastical	1
superintendents	1
founded	1
in	1
their	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
parochial	1
overseers	1
and	1
parish	1
priests	1
and	1
so	1
all	1
of	1
these	1
answers	1
were	1
unhesitating	1
and	1
certain	1
All	1
such	1
questions	1
as	1
for	1
instance	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
failure	1
of	1
crops	1
of	1
the	1
adherence	1
of	1
certain	1
tribes	1
to	1
their	1
ancient	1
beliefs	1
etc	1
questions	1
which	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
convenient	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
official	1
machine	1
are	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
solved	1
for	1
ages	1
received	1
full	1
unhesitating	1
solution	1
And	1
this	1
solution	1
was	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
contention	1
But	1
Stremov	1
who	1
had	1
felt	1
stung	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
sitting	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
s	1
report	1
resorted	1
to	1
tactics	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
not	1
anticipated	1
Stremov	1
carrying	1
with	1
him	1
several	1
members	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
not	1
contenting	1
himself	1
with	1
warmly	1
defending	1
the	1
measure	1
proposed	1
by	1
Karenin	1
proposed	1
other	1
more	1
extreme	1
measures	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
These	1
measures	1
still	1
further	1
exaggerated	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
fundamental	1
idea	1
were	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
commission	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
Stremov	1
s	1
tactics	1
became	1
apparent	1
Carried	1
to	1
an	1
extreme	1
the	1
measures	1
seemed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
absurd	1
that	1
the	1
highest	1
authorities	1
and	1
public	1
opinion	1
and	1
intellectual	1
ladies	1
and	1
the	1
newspapers	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
fell	1
foul	1
of	1
them	1
expressing	1
their	1
indignation	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
measures	1
and	1
their	1
nominal	1
father	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Stremov	1
drew	1
back	1
affecting	1
to	1
have	1
blindly	1
followed	1
Karenin	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
astounded	1
and	1
distressed	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
This	1
meant	1
the	1
defeat	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
failing	1
health	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
domestic	1
griefs	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
split	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
Some	1
members	1
with	1
Stremov	1
at	1
their	1
head	1
justified	1
their	1
mistake	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
revision	1
instituted	1
by	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
was	1
rubbish	1
and	1
simply	1
so	1
much	1
waste	1
paper	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
a	1
following	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
so	1
revolutionary	1
an	1
attitude	1
to	1
official	1
documents	1
persisted	1
in	1
upholding	1
the	1
statements	1
obtained	1
by	1
the	1
revising	1
commission	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
spheres	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
society	1
all	1
was	1
chaos	1
and	1
although	1
everyone	1
was	1
interested	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
tell	1
whether	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
really	1
were	1
becoming	1
impoverished	1
and	1
ruined	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
flourishing	1
condition	1
The	1
position	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
owing	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
partly	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
contempt	1
lavished	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
infidelity	1
became	1
very	1
precarious	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
he	1
took	1
an	1
important	1
resolution	1
To	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
he	1
announced	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
permission	1
to	1
go	1
himself	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
question	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
And	1
having	1
obtained	1
permission	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
these	1
remote	1
provinces	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
departure	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
sensation	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
just	1
before	1
he	1
started	1
he	1
officially	1
returned	1
the	1
posting	1
fares	1
allowed	1
him	1
for	1
twelve	1
horses	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
his	1
destination	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
very	1
noble	1
Betsy	1
said	1
about	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
Why	1
take	1
money	1
for	1
posting	1
horses	1
when	1
everyone	1
knows	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
railways	1
everywhere	1
now	1
But	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
and	1
the	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
opinion	1
annoyed	1
her	1
indeed	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
said	1
she	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
many	1
millions	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
when	1
my	1
husband	1
goes	1
on	1
a	1
revising	1
tour	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
pleasant	1
traveling	1
about	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
settled	1
arrangement	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
coachman	1
on	1
the	1
money	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
remote	1
provinces	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stopped	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
at	1
Moscow	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
he	1
was	1
driving	1
back	1
from	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
governor	1
general	1
At	1
the	1
crossroads	1
by	1
Gazetoy	1
Place	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
crowds	1
of	1
carriages	1
and	1
sledges	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
his	1
name	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
cheerful	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
looking	1
round	1
At	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
pavement	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
stylish	1
overcoat	1
and	1
a	1
low	1
crowned	1
fashionable	1
hat	1
jauntily	1
askew	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
white	1
teeth	1
and	1
red	1
lips	1
stood	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
radiant	1
young	1
and	1
beaming	1
He	1
called	1
him	1
vigorously	1
and	1
urgently	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
his	1
stopping	1
He	1
had	1
one	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
that	1
was	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
were	1
thrust	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
velvet	1
hat	1
and	1
two	1
children	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
smiling	1
and	1
beckoning	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
The	1
lady	1
smiled	1
a	1
kindly	1
smile	1
too	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
waved	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
It	1
was	1
Dolly	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
anyone	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
brother	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
driven	1
on	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
told	1
his	1
coachman	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
snow	1
to	1
him	1
Well	1
what	1
a	1
shame	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
Been	1
here	1
long	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Dussots	1
yesterday	1
and	1
saw	1
Karenin	1
on	1
the	1
visitors	1
list	1
but	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
my	1
head	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sticking	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
looked	1
you	1
up	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
knocking	1
one	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
shake	1
the	1
snow	1
off	1
What	1
a	1
shame	1
of	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
he	1
repeated	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
busy	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
responded	1
dryly	1
Come	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
she	1
does	1
so	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
unfolded	1
the	1
rug	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
frozen	1
feet	1
were	1
wrapped	1
and	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
over	1
the	1
snow	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Why	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
cutting	1
us	1
like	1
this	1
for	1
said	1
Dolly	1
smiling	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
busy	1
Delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
clearly	1
indicating	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
annoyed	1
by	1
it	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
Tell	1
me	1
how	1
is	1
my	1
darling	1
Anna	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
mumbled	1
something	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
But	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
stopped	1
him	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
we	1
ll	1
do	1
tomorrow	1
Dolly	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
We	1
ll	1
ask	1
Koznishev	1
and	1
Pestsov	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
entertain	1
him	1
with	1
our	1
Moscow	1
celebrities	1
Yes	1
please	1
do	1
come	1
said	1
Dolly	1
we	1
will	1
expect	1
you	1
at	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
o	1
clock	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
How	1
is	1
my	1
darling	1
Anna	1
How	1
long	1
She	1
is	1
quite	1
well	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
mumbled	1
frowning	1
Delighted	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
towards	1
his	1
carriage	1
You	1
will	1
come	1
Dolly	1
called	1
after	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
something	1
which	1
Dolly	1
could	1
not	1
catch	1
in	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
carriages	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
round	1
tomorrow	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
buried	1
himself	1
in	1
it	1
so	1
as	1
neither	1
to	1
see	1
nor	1
be	1
seen	1
Queer	1
fish	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
before	1
his	1
face	1
indicating	1
a	1
caress	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
walked	1
jauntily	1
along	1
the	1
pavement	1
Stiva	1
Stiva	1
Dolly	1
called	1
reddening	1
He	1
turned	1
round	1
I	1
must	1
get	1
coats	1
you	1
know	1
for	1
Grisha	1
and	1
Tanya	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
money	1
Never	1
mind	1
you	1
tell	1
them	1
I	1
ll	1
pay	1
the	1
bill	1
and	1
he	1
vanished	1
nodding	1
genially	1
to	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
who	1
drove	1
by	1
Chapter	1
7	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
was	1
Sunday	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Theater	1
to	1
a	1
rehearsal	1
of	1
the	1
ballet	1
and	1
gave	1
Masha	1
Tchibisova	1
a	1
pretty	1
dancing	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
taken	1
under	1
his	1
protection	1
the	1
coral	1
necklace	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
her	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
scenes	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
daylight	1
of	1
the	1
theater	1
managed	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
pretty	1
little	1
face	1
radiant	1
over	1
her	1
present	1
Besides	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
necklace	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
arrange	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
meeting	1
after	1
the	1
ballet	1
After	1
explaining	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
ballet	1
he	1
promised	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
act	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
supper	1
From	1
the	1
theater	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
drove	1
to	1
Ohotny	1
Row	1
selected	1
himself	1
the	1
fish	1
and	1
asparagus	1
for	1
dinner	1
and	1
by	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
was	1
at	1
Dussots	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
three	1
people	1
luckily	1
all	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hotel	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
recently	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
and	1
was	1
staying	1
there	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
promoted	1
to	1
that	1
position	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
revision	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
Karenin	1
whom	1
he	1
must	1
see	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
bringing	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
liked	1
dining	1
but	1
still	1
better	1
he	1
liked	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
dinner	1
small	1
but	1
very	1
choice	1
both	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
drink	1
and	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
guests	1
He	1
particularly	1
liked	1
the	1
program	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
s	1
dinner	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
fresh	1
perch	1
asparagus	1
and	1
la	1
pi`ece	1
de	1
resistance	1
first	1
rate	1
but	1
quite	1
plain	1
roast	1
beef	1
and	1
wines	1
to	1
suit	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Levin	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
obtrusively	1
evident	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
girl	1
cousin	1
too	1
and	1
young	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
and	1
la	1
pi`ece	1
de	1
resistance	1
among	1
the	1
guests	1
Sergey	1
Koznishev	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
a	1
Moscow	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
philosopher	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
a	1
Petersburger	1
and	1
a	1
practical	1
politician	1
He	1
was	1
asking	1
too	1
the	1
well	1
known	1
eccentric	1
enthusiast	1
Pestsov	1
a	1
liberal	1
a	1
great	1
talker	1
a	1
musician	1
an	1
historian	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
delightfully	1
youthful	1
person	1
of	1
fifty	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sauce	1
or	1
garnish	1
for	1
Koznishev	1
and	1
Karenin	1
He	1
would	1
provoke	1
them	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
off	1
The	1
second	1
installment	1
for	1
the	1
forest	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
merchant	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
exhausted	1
Dolly	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
amiable	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
of	1
late	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
pleased	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
light	1
hearted	1
mood	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
circumstances	1
a	1
little	1
unpleasant	1
but	1
these	1
two	1
circumstances	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
good	1
humored	1
gaiety	1
which	1
flooded	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
These	1
two	1
circumstances	1
were	1
first	1
that	1
on	1
meeting	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
reserved	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
or	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
with	1
the	1
rumors	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
guessed	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
between	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
That	1
was	1
one	1
disagreeable	1
thing	1
The	1
other	1
slightly	1
disagreeable	1
fact	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
like	1
all	1
new	1
heads	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
already	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
person	1
who	1
got	1
up	1
at	1
six	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
worked	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
his	1
subordinates	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Moreover	1
this	1
new	1
head	1
had	1
the	1
further	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
bear	1
in	1
his	1
manners	1
and	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
reports	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
class	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
predecessor	1
had	1
belonged	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
hitherto	1
belonged	1
himself	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
office	1
in	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
chief	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
affable	1
and	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
Consequently	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
deemed	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
non	1
official	1
dress	1
The	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
chief	1
might	1
not	1
tender	1
him	1
a	1
warm	1
reception	1
was	1
the	1
other	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
But	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
instinctively	1
felt	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
all	1
right	1
They	1
re	1
all	1
people	1
all	1
men	1
like	1
us	1
poor	1
sinners	1
why	1
be	1
nasty	1
and	1
quarrelsome	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hotel	1
Good	1
day	1
Vassily	1
he	1
said	1
walking	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
with	1

receiving	1
Yes	1
sir	1
Vassily	1
responded	1
smiling	1
You	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
here	1
yesterday	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
entrance	1
Is	1
this	1
number	1
seven	1
Levin	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
a	1
peasant	1
from	1
Tver	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
measuring	1
a	1
fresh	1
bearskin	1
when	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
in	1
What	1
you	1
killed	1
him	1
cried	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Well	1
done	1
A	1
she	1
bear	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
Arhip	1
He	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
hat	1
Come	1
take	1
off	1
your	1
coat	1
and	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
said	1
Levin	1
taking	1
his	1
hat	1
No	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
time	1
I	1
ve	1
only	1
looked	1
in	1
for	1
a	1
tiny	1
second	1
answered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
He	1
threw	1
open	1
his	1
coat	1
but	1
afterwards	1
did	1
take	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
hour	1
talking	1
to	1
Levin	1
about	1
hunting	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
subjects	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
please	1
what	1
you	1
did	1
abroad	1
Where	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
when	1
the	1
peasant	1
had	1
gone	1
Oh	1
I	1
stayed	1
in	1
Germany	1
in	1
Prussia	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
in	1
England	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
capitals	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
towns	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
that	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
I	1
went	1
Yes	1
I	1
knew	1
your	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
labor	1
question	1
Not	1
a	1
bit	1
in	1
Russia	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
labor	1
question	1
In	1
Russia	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
working	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
exists	1
there	1
too	1
but	1
there	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
repairing	1
what	1
s	1
been	1
ruined	1
while	1
with	1
us	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
possible	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
you	1
re	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
and	1
are	1
hunting	1
bears	1
and	1
working	1
and	1
interested	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
told	1
me	1
another	1
story	1
he	1
met	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
depressed	1
state	1
talking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
death	1
Well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
given	1
up	1
thinking	1
of	1
death	1
said	1
Levin	1
It	1
s	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
high	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
nonsense	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
I	1
m	1
telling	1
you	1
I	1
do	1
value	1
my	1
idea	1
and	1
my	1
work	1
awfully	1
but	1
in	1
reality	1
only	1
consider	1
this	1
all	1
this	1
world	1
of	1
ours	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
speck	1
of	1
mildew	1
which	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
tiny	1
planet	1
And	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
suppose	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
something	1
great	1
ideas	1
work	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
dust	1
and	1
ashes	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
as	1
old	1
as	1
the	1
hills	1
my	1
boy	1
It	1
is	1
old	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
when	1
you	1
grasp	1
this	1
fully	1
then	1
somehow	1
everything	1
becomes	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
When	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
die	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
not	1
today	1
and	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
then	1
everything	1
is	1
so	1
unimportant	1
And	1
I	1
consider	1
my	1
idea	1
very	1
important	1
but	1
it	1
turns	1
out	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
unimportant	1
too	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
carried	1
out	1
as	1
doing	1
for	1
that	1
bear	1
So	1
one	1
goes	1
on	1
living	1
amusing	1
oneself	1
with	1
hunting	1
with	1
work	1
anything	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
death	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
a	1
subtle	1
affectionate	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Levin	1
Well	1
of	1
course	1
Here	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
my	1
point	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
you	1
attacked	1
me	1
for	1
seeking	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
life	1
Don	1
t	1
be	1
so	1
severe	1
O	1
moralist	1
No	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
what	1
s	1
fine	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
Levin	1
hesitated	1
oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
All	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
dead	1
Why	1
so	1
soon	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
s	1
less	1
charm	1
in	1
life	1
when	1
one	1
thinks	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
more	1
peace	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
finish	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
best	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
going	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
getting	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time	1
Oh	1
no	1
stay	1
a	1
bit	1
said	1
Levin	1
keeping	1
him	1
Now	1
when	1
shall	1
we	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
again	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
nice	1
person	1
Why	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
came	1
for	1
You	1
simply	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
us	1
today	1
Your	1
brother	1
s	1
coming	1
and	1
Karenin	1
my	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
s	1
here	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
inquire	1
about	1
Kitty	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
diplomat	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
Whether	1
she	1
s	1
coming	1
or	1
not	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
So	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
Of	1
course	1
At	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
then	1
and	1
not	1
evening	1
dress	1
And	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
below	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
department	1
Instinct	1
had	1
not	1
misled	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
The	1
terrible	1
new	1
head	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
extremely	1
amenable	1
person	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
lunched	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
stayed	1
on	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
before	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
on	1
coming	1
back	1
from	1
church	1
service	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
indoors	1
He	1
had	1
two	1
pieces	1
of	1
business	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
morning	1
first	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
send	1
on	1
a	1
deputation	1
from	1
the	1
native	1
tribes	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Moscow	1
secondly	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
promised	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
lawyer	1
The	1
deputation	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
instigation	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
discomforting	1
and	1
even	1
dangerous	1
aspect	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
in	1
Moscow	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
deputation	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
conception	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
play	1
They	1
na"ively	1
believed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
business	1
to	1
lay	1
before	1
the	1
commission	1
their	1
needs	1
and	1
the	1
actual	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
utterly	1
failed	1
to	1
grasp	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
statements	1
and	1
requests	1
supported	1
the	1
contention	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
so	1
spoiled	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
busily	1
engaged	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
program	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
depart	1
and	1
on	1
dismissing	1
them	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
for	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
the	1
deputation	1
He	1
had	1
his	1
chief	1
support	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
in	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
specialist	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
deputations	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
them	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
Having	1
completed	1
this	1
task	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
wrote	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
lawyer	1
Without	1
the	1
slightest	1
hesitation	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
permission	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
judge	1
best	1
In	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
enclosed	1
three	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
notes	1
to	1
Anna	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
portfolio	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
away	1
Since	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
left	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
not	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
again	1
and	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
though	1
only	1
to	1
one	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
since	1
especially	1
he	1
had	1
translated	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
real	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
ink	1
and	1
paper	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
used	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
intention	1
and	1
by	1
now	1
distinctly	1
perceived	1
the	1
feasibility	1
of	1
its	1
execution	1
He	1
was	1
sealing	1
the	1
envelope	1
to	1
the	1
lawyer	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
loud	1
tones	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
voice	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
disputing	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
servant	1
and	1
insisting	1
on	1
being	1
announced	1
No	1
matter	1
thought	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
I	1
will	1
inform	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
explain	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
dine	1
with	1
him	1
Come	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
collecting	1
his	1
papers	1
and	1
putting	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
blotting	1
paper	1
There	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
re	1
talking	1
nonsense	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
at	1
home	1
responded	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
voice	1
addressing	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
in	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
Oblonsky	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
awfully	1
glad	1
I	1
ve	1
found	1
you	1
So	1
I	1
hope	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
began	1
cheerfully	1
I	1
cannot	1
come	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
coldly	1
standing	1
and	1
not	1
asking	1
his	1
visitor	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
those	1
frigid	1
relations	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
stand	1
with	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
a	1
suit	1
for	1
divorce	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
into	1
account	1
the	1
ocean	1
of	1
kindliness	1
brimming	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
opened	1
wide	1
his	1
clear	1
shining	1
eyes	1
Why	1
can	1
t	1
you	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
perplexity	1
speaking	1
in	1
French	1
Oh	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
promise	1
And	1
we	1
re	1
all	1
counting	1
on	1
you	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
dine	1
at	1
your	1
house	1
because	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
relationship	1
which	1
have	1
existed	1
between	1
us	1
must	1
cease	1
How	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
What	1
for	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
beginning	1
an	1
action	1
for	1
divorce	1
against	1
your	1
sister	1
my	1
wife	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
But	1
before	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
sentence	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
behaving	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
He	1
groaned	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
an	1
armchair	1
No	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
cried	1
Oblonsky	1
and	1
his	1
suffering	1
was	1
apparent	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
Excuse	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sat	1
down	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
he	1
anticipated	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unavoidable	1
for	1
him	1
to	1

his	1
position	1
and	1
that	1
whatever	1
explanations	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
would	1
remain	1
unchanged	1
Yes	1
I	1
am	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
painful	1
necessity	1
of	1
seeking	1
a	1
divorce	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
one	1
thing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
excellent	1
upright	1
man	1
I	1
know	1
Anna	1
excuse	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
change	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman	1
and	1
so	1
excuse	1
me	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
There	1
is	1
some	1
misunderstanding	1
said	1
he	1
Oh	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
Pardon	1
I	1
understand	1
interposed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
One	1
thing	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
in	1
haste	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
in	1
haste	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
acting	1
in	1
haste	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
coldly	1
but	1
one	1
cannot	1
ask	1
advice	1
of	1
anyone	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
matter	1
I	1
have	1
quite	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
This	1
is	1
awful	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
one	1
thing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
No	1
action	1
has	1
yet	1
been	1
taken	1
if	1
I	1
understand	1
rightly	1
Before	1
you	1
take	1
advice	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
loves	1
Anna	1
like	1
a	1
sister	1
she	1
loves	1
you	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
Do	1
me	1
that	1
favor	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
pondered	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
sympathetically	1
without	1
interrupting	1
his	1
silence	1
You	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
That	1
was	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
I	1
imagine	1
our	1
relations	1
must	1
change	1
Why	1
so	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
that	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
our	1
connection	1
you	1
have	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
part	1
the	1
same	1
friendly	1
feeling	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
had	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
sincere	1
esteem	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
Even	1
if	1
your	1
worst	1
suppositions	1
were	1
correct	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
take	1
on	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
our	1
relations	1
should	1
be	1
affected	1
But	1
now	1
do	1
this	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
Well	1
we	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
differently	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
coldly	1
However	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
discuss	1
it	1
No	1
why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
you	1
come	1
today	1
to	1
dine	1
anyway	1
My	1
wife	1
s	1
expecting	1
you	1
Please	1
do	1
come	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
wonderful	1
woman	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
I	1
implore	1
you	1
If	1
you	1
so	1
much	1
wish	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sighing	1
And	1
anxious	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
inquired	1
about	1
what	1
interested	1
them	1
both	1
the	1
new	1
head	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
department	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
yet	1
old	1
who	1
had	1
suddenly	1
been	1
promoted	1
to	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
position	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
previously	1
felt	1
no	1
liking	1
for	1
Count	1
Anitchkin	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
differed	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
opinions	1
But	1
now	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
readily	1
comprehensible	1
to	1
officials	1
that	1
hatred	1
felt	1
by	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
suffered	1
a	1
defeat	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
promotion	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
him	1
Well	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1
him	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
a	1
malignant	1
smile	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
our	1
sitting	1
yesterday	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
work	1
capitally	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
energetic	1
Yes	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
energy	1
directed	1
to	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Is	1
he	1
aiming	1
at	1
doing	1
anything	1
or	1
simply	1
undoing	1
what	1
s	1
been	1
done	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
great	1
misfortune	1
of	1
our	1
government	1
this	1
paper	1
administration	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
worthy	1
representative	1
Really	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
fault	1
one	1
could	1
find	1
with	1
him	1
His	1
policy	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
fellow	1
answered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
ve	1
just	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
really	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
We	1
lunched	1
together	1
and	1
I	1
taught	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
drink	1
wine	1
and	1
oranges	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
cooling	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
wonder	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
He	1
liked	1
it	1
awfully	1
No	1
really	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
Why	1
good	1
heavens	1
it	1
s	1
four	1
already	1
and	1
I	1
ve	1
still	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Dolgovushin	1
s	1
So	1
please	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
dinner	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
grieve	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
me	1
The	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
out	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
I	1
ve	1
promised	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
he	1
answered	1
wearily	1
Believe	1
me	1
I	1
appreciate	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
regret	1
it	1
answered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
And	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
he	1
patted	1
the	1
footman	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
chuckled	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
At	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
not	1
evening	1
dress	1
please	1
he	1
shouted	1
once	1
more	1
turning	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Chapter	1
9	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
five	1
and	1
several	1
guests	1
had	1
already	1
arrived	1
before	1
the	1
host	1
himself	1
got	1
home	1
He	1
went	1
in	1
together	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Koznishev	1
and	1
Pestsov	1
who	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
street	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
leading	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
Moscow	1
intellectuals	1
as	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
called	1
them	1
Both	1
were	1
men	1
respected	1
for	1
their	1
character	1
and	1
their	1
intelligence	1
They	1
respected	1
each	1
other	1
but	1
were	1
in	1
complete	1
and	1
hopeless	1
disagreement	1
upon	1
almost	1
every	1
subject	1
not	1
because	1
they	1
belonged	1
to	1
opposite	1
parties	1
but	1
precisely	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
party	1
their	1
enemies	1
refused	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
distinction	1
between	1
their	1
views	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
party	1
each	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
special	1
shade	1
of	1
opinion	1
And	1
since	1
no	1
difference	1
is	1
less	1
easily	1
overcome	1
than	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
about	1
semi	1
abstract	1
questions	1
they	1
never	1
agreed	1
in	1
any	1
opinion	1
and	1
had	1
long	1
indeed	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
jeer	1
without	1
anger	1
each	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
s	1
incorrigible	1
aberrations	1
They	1
were	1
just	1
going	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
when	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
overtook	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
there	1
were	1
already	1
sitting	1
Prince	1
Alexander	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
young	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
Turovtsin	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Karenin	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
immediately	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
not	1
going	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
without	1
him	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
in	1
her	1
best	1
gray	1
silk	1
gown	1
obviously	1
worried	1
about	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
dinner	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
absence	1
was	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
party	1
mix	1
without	1
him	1
All	1
were	1
sitting	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
priests	1
wives	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
so	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
expressed	1
it	1
obviously	1
wondering	1
why	1
they	1
were	1
there	1
and	1
pumping	1
up	1
remarks	1
simply	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
silent	1
Turovtsin	1
good	1
simple	1
man	1
felt	1
unmistakably	1
a	1
fish	1
out	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
thick	1
lips	1
greeted	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
as	1
plainly	1
as	1
words	1
Well	1
old	1
boy	1
you	1
have	1
popped	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
learned	1
set	1
A	1
drinking	1
party	1
now	1
or	1
the	1
Ch^ateau	1
des	1
Fleurs	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
line	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
his	1
bright	1
little	1
eyes	1
watching	1
Karenin	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
formed	1
a	1
phrase	1
to	1
sum	1
up	1
that	1
politician	1
of	1
whom	1
guests	1
were	1
invited	1
to	1
partake	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
sturgeon	1
Kitty	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
calling	1
up	1
all	1
her	1
energies	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
from	1
blushing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
Young	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
introduced	1
to	1
Karenin	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
Karenin	1
himself	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
fashion	1
for	1
a	1
dinner	1
with	1
ladies	1
and	1
was	1
wearing	1
evening	1
dress	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
tie	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
simply	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
promise	1
and	1
was	1
performing	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
duty	1
in	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
this	1
gathering	1
He	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
person	1
chiefly	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
chill	1
benumbing	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
before	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
came	1
in	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
apologized	1
explaining	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
detained	1
by	1
that	1
prince	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
scapegoat	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
absences	1
and	1
unpunctualities	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
acquainted	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
bringing	1
together	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Koznishev	1
started	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
Russification	1
of	1
Poland	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
immediately	1
plunged	1
with	1
Pestsov	1
Slapping	1
Turovtsin	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
he	1
whispered	1
something	1
comic	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
Then	1
he	1
told	1
Kitty	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
very	1
pretty	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
presented	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
to	1
Karenin	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
kneaded	1
together	1
the	1
social	1
dough	1
that	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
became	1
very	1
lively	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
merry	1
buzz	1
of	1
voices	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
arrived	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
as	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
found	1
to	1
his	1
horror	1
that	1
the	1
port	1
and	1
sherry	1
had	1
been	1
procured	1
from	1
Depr'e	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
Levy	1
and	1
directing	1
that	1
the	1
coachman	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
off	1
as	1
speedily	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
Levy	1
s	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
In	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
late	1
You	1
can	1
never	1
help	1
being	1
late	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
taking	1
his	1
arm	1
Have	1
you	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
people	1
Who	1
s	1
here	1
asked	1
Levin	1
unable	1
to	1
help	1
blushing	1
as	1
he	1
knocked	1
the	1
snow	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
with	1
his	1
glove	1
All	1
our	1
own	1
set	1
Kitty	1
s	1
here	1
Come	1
along	1
I	1
ll	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
Karenin	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
liberal	1
views	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
to	1
meet	1
Karenin	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
felt	1
a	1
flattering	1
distinction	1
and	1
so	1
treated	1
his	1
best	1
friends	1
to	1
this	1
honor	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
Konstantin	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
making	1
such	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
Kitty	1
since	1
that	1
memorable	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
not	1
counting	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
highroad	1
He	1
had	1
known	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
here	1
today	1
But	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
thoughts	1
free	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
suddenly	1
conscious	1
of	1
such	1
delight	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
of	1
such	1
dread	1
that	1
his	1
breath	1
failed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
What	1
is	1
she	1
like	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
like	1
Like	1
what	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
or	1
like	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
What	1
if	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
told	1
the	1
truth	1
Why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
truth	1
he	1
thought	1
Oh	1
please	1
introduce	1
me	1
to	1
Karenin	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
desperately	1
determined	1
step	1
he	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
beheld	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
nor	1
was	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
different	1
She	1
was	1
scared	1
shy	1
shame	1
faced	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
charming	1
from	1
it	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
delighted	1
and	1
so	1
confused	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
delight	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
Dolly	1
who	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
break	1
down	1
and	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
cry	1
She	1
crimsoned	1
turned	1
white	1
crimsoned	1
again	1
and	1
grew	1
faint	1
waiting	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
bowed	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
without	1
speaking	1
Except	1
for	1
the	1
slight	1
quiver	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
moisture	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
made	1
them	1
brighter	1
her	1
smile	1
was	1
almost	1
calm	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
How	1
long	1
it	1
is	1
since	1
we	1
ve	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
with	1
desperate	1
determination	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
her	1
cold	1
hand	1
You	1
ve	1
not	1
seen	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
driving	1
from	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
to	1
Ergushovo	1
When	1
she	1
asked	1
wondering	1
You	1
were	1
driving	1
to	1
Ergushovo	1
said	1
Levin	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
sob	1
with	1
the	1
rapture	1
that	1
was	1
flooding	1
his	1
heart	1
And	1
how	1
dared	1
I	1
associate	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
anything	1
not	1
innocent	1
with	1
this	1
touching	1
creature	1
And	1
yes	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
what	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
thought	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Karenin	1
Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
He	1
mentioned	1
their	1
names	1
Very	1
glad	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
again	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
coldly	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
Levin	1
You	1
are	1
acquainted	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
asked	1
in	1
surprise	1
We	1
spent	1
three	1
hours	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
said	1
Levin	1
smiling	1
but	1
got	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
masquerade	1
quite	1
mystified	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
was	1
Nonsense	1
Come	1
along	1
please	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
pointing	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
The	1
men	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
table	1
laid	1
with	1
six	1
sorts	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
cheese	1
some	1
with	1
little	1
silver	1
spades	1
and	1
some	1
without	1
caviar	1
herrings	1
preserves	1
of	1
various	1
kinds	1
and	1
plates	1
with	1
slices	1
of	1
French	1
bread	1
The	1
men	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
strong	1
smelling	1
spirits	1
and	1
salt	1
delicacies	1
and	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
Russification	1
of	1
Poland	1
between	1
Koznishev	1
Karenin	1
and	1
Pestsov	1
died	1
down	1
in	1
anticipation	1
of	1
dinner	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
unequaled	1
in	1
his	1
skill	1
in	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
most	1
heated	1
and	1
serious	1
argument	1
by	1
some	1
unexpected	1
pinch	1
of	1
Attic	1
salt	1
that	1
changed	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
his	1
opponent	1
He	1
did	1
this	1
now	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
been	1
maintaining	1
that	1
the	1
Russification	1
of	1
Poland	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
accomplished	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
larger	1
measures	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
introduced	1
by	1
the	1
Russian	1
government	1
Pestsov	1
insisted	1
that	1
one	1
country	1
can	1
only	1
absorb	1
another	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
densely	1
populated	1
Koznishev	1
admitted	1
both	1
points	1
but	1
with	1
limitations	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
conclude	1
the	1
argument	1
Koznishev	1
said	1
smiling	1
So	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
Russification	1
of	1
our	1
foreign	1
populations	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
method	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
as	1
many	1
children	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
My	1
brother	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
terribly	1
in	1
fault	1
I	1
see	1
You	1
married	1
men	1
especially	1
you	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
are	1
the	1
real	1
patriots	1
what	1
number	1
have	1
you	1
reached	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
genially	1
at	1
their	1
host	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
a	1
tiny	1
wine	1
glass	1
to	1
him	1
Everyone	1
laughed	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
particular	1
good	1
humor	1
Oh	1
yes	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
method	1
he	1
said	1
munching	1
cheese	1
and	1
filling	1
the	1
wine	1
glass	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
sort	1
of	1
spirit	1
The	1
conversation	1
dropped	1
at	1
the	1
jest	1
This	1
cheese	1
is	1
not	1
bad	1
Shall	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
some	1
said	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Why	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
going	1
in	1
for	1
gymnastics	1
again	1
he	1
asked	1
Levin	1
pinching	1
his	1
muscle	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
bent	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
under	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
fingers	1
the	1
muscles	1
swelled	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
sound	1
cheese	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
knob	1
of	1
iron	1
through	1
the	1
fine	1
cloth	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
What	1
biceps	1
A	1
perfect	1
Samson	1
I	1
imagine	1
great	1
strength	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
hunting	1
bears	1
observed	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
mistiest	1
notions	1
about	1
the	1
chase	1
He	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
spread	1
with	1
cheese	1
a	1
wafer	1
of	1
bread	1
fine	1
as	1
a	1
spider	1
web	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
Quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
a	1
child	1
can	1
kill	1
a	1
bear	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
moving	1
aside	1
for	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1
the	1
table	1
You	1
have	1
killed	1
a	1
bear	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
told	1
said	1
Kitty	1
trying	1
assiduously	1
to	1
catch	1
with	1
her	1
fork	1
a	1
perverse	1
mushroom	1
that	1
would	1
slip	1
away	1
and	1
setting	1
the	1
lace	1
quivering	1
over	1
her	1
white	1
arm	1
Are	1
there	1
bears	1
on	1
your	1
place	1
she	1
added	1
turning	1
her	1
charming	1
little	1
head	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1
There	1
was	1
apparently	1
nothing	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
what	1
unutterable	1
meaning	1
there	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
sound	1
in	1
every	1
turn	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
her	1
eyes	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
There	1
was	1
entreaty	1
for	1
forgiveness	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
tenderness	1
soft	1
timid	1
tenderness	1
and	1
promise	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
believe	1
in	1
and	1
which	1
choked	1
him	1
with	1
happiness	1
No	1
we	1
ve	1
been	1
hunting	1
in	1
the	1
Tver	1
province	1
It	1
was	1
coming	1
back	1
from	1
there	1
that	1
I	1
met	1
your	1
beau	1
fr`ere	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
or	1
your	1
beau	1
fr`ere	1
s	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
amusing	1
meeting	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
telling	1
with	1
droll	1
good	1
humor	1
how	1
after	1
not	1
sleeping	1
all	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
wearing	1
an	1
old	1
fur	1
lined	1
full	1
skirted	1
coat	1
got	1
into	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
compartment	1
The	1
conductor	1
forgetting	1
the	1
proverb	1
would	1
have	1
chucked	1
me	1
out	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
attire	1
but	1
thereupon	1
I	1
began	1
expressing	1
my	1
feelings	1
in	1
elevated	1
language	1
and	1
you	1
too	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
Karenin	1
and	1
forgetting	1
his	1
name	1
at	1
first	1
would	1
have	1
ejected	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
coat	1
but	1
afterwards	1
you	1
took	1
my	1
part	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
extremely	1
grateful	1
The	1
rights	1
of	1
passengers	1
generally	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
seats	1
are	1
too	1
ill	1
defined	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
rubbing	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
on	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
about	1
me	1
said	1
Levin	1
smiling	1
good	1
naturedly	1
but	1
I	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
intellectual	1
conversation	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
my	1
attire	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
while	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
their	1
hostess	1
had	1
one	1
ear	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
he	1
glanced	1
askance	1
at	1
him	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
today	1
Why	1
such	1
a	1
conquering	1
hero	1
he	1
thought	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
feeling	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
wings	1
Levin	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
Not	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
only	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
there	1
existed	1
for	1
him	1
only	1
himself	1
with	1
enormously	1
increased	1
importance	1
and	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
giddy	1
and	1
far	1
away	1
down	1
below	1
were	1
all	1
those	1
nice	1
excellent	1
Karenins	1
Oblonskys	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
Quite	1
without	1
attracting	1
notice	1
without	1
glancing	1
at	1
them	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
other	1
places	1
left	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
put	1
Levin	1
and	1
Kitty	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
Oh	1
you	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
sit	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
as	1
choice	1
as	1
the	1
china	1
in	1
which	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
a	1
connoisseur	1
The	1
soupe	1
Marie	1
Louise	1
was	1
a	1
splendid	1
success	1
the	1
tiny	1
pies	1
eaten	1
with	1
it	1
melted	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
and	1
were	1
irreproachable	1
The	1
two	1
footmen	1
and	1
Matvey	1
in	1
white	1
cravats	1
did	1
their	1
duty	1
with	1
the	1
dishes	1
and	1
wines	1
unobtrusively	1
quietly	1
and	1
swiftly	1
On	1
the	1
material	1
side	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
a	1
success	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
immaterial	1
The	1
conversation	1
at	1
times	1
general	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
between	1
individuals	1
never	1
paused	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
company	1
was	1
so	1
lively	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
without	1
stopping	1
speaking	1
and	1
even	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
thawed	1
Chapter	1
10	1
Pestsov	1
liked	1
thrashing	1
an	1
argument	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
words	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
view	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
he	1
said	1
over	1
the	1
soup	1
addressing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
mere	1
density	1
of	1
population	1
alone	1
but	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
fundamental	1
ideas	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
principles	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
languidly	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
haste	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
In	1
my	1
opinion	1
influence	1
over	1
another	1
people	1
is	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
higher	1
development	1
which	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
question	1
Pestsov	1
broke	1
in	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
seemed	1
always	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
whole	1
soul	1
into	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
In	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
make	1
higher	1
development	1
consist	1
The	1
English	1
the	1
French	1
the	1
Germans	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
stage	1
of	1
development	1
Which	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
nationalize	1
the	1
other	1
We	1
see	1
the	1
Rhine	1
provinces	1
have	1
been	1
turned	1
French	1
but	1
the	1
Germans	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
a	1
lower	1
stage	1
he	1
shouted	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
law	1
at	1
work	1
there	1
I	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
influence	1
is	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
true	1
civilization	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
slightly	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
But	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
outward	1
signs	1
of	1
true	1
civilization	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
I	1
imagine	1
such	1
signs	1
are	1
generally	1
very	1
well	1
known	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
But	1
are	1
they	1
fully	1
known	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
put	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
accepted	1
view	1
now	1
that	1
real	1
culture	1
must	1
be	1
purely	1
classical	1
but	1
we	1
see	1
most	1
intense	1
disputes	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
denying	1
that	1
the	1
opposite	1
camp	1
has	1
strong	1
points	1
in	1
its	1
favor	1
You	1
are	1
for	1
classics	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Will	1
you	1
take	1
red	1
wine	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
expressing	1
my	1
own	1
opinion	1
of	1
either	1
form	1
of	1
culture	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
said	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
glass	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
condescension	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
both	1
sides	1
have	1
strong	1
arguments	1
to	1
support	1
them	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
addressing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
My	1
sympathies	1
are	1
classical	1
from	1
education	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
discussion	1
I	1
am	1
personally	1
unable	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
a	1
conclusion	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
distinct	1
grounds	1
for	1
classical	1
studies	1
being	1
given	1
a	1
preeminence	1
over	1
scientific	1
studies	1
The	1
natural	1
sciences	1
have	1
just	1
as	1
great	1
an	1
educational	1
value	1
put	1
in	1
Pestsov	1
Take	1
astronomy	1
take	1
botany	1
or	1
zoology	1
with	1
its	1
system	1
of	1
general	1
principles	1
I	1
cannot	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
that	1
responded	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
process	1
of	1
studying	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
language	1
has	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
favorable	1
influence	1
on	1
intellectual	1
development	1
Moreover	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
classical	1
authors	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
moral	1
while	1
unfortunately	1
with	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
sciences	1
are	1
associated	1
the	1
false	1
and	1
noxious	1
doctrines	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
our	1
day	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
but	1
Pestsov	1
interrupted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
rich	1
bass	1
He	1
began	1
warmly	1
contesting	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
waited	1
serenely	1
to	1
speak	1
obviously	1
with	1
a	1
convincing	1
reply	1
ready	1
But	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiling	1
subtly	1
and	1
addressing	1
Karenin	1
One	1
must	1
allow	1
that	1
to	1
weigh	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
classical	1
and	1
scientific	1
studies	1
is	1
a	1
difficult	1
task	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
form	1
of	1
education	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
preferred	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
quickly	1
and	1
conclusively	1
decided	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
classical	1
education	1
as	1
you	1
expressed	1
it	1
just	1
now	1
its	1
moral	1
disons	1
le	1
mot	1
anti	1
nihilist	1
influence	1
Undoubtedly	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
distinctive	1
property	1
of	1
anti	1
nihilistic	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
classical	1
studies	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
subject	1
more	1
have	1
weighed	1
the	1
arguments	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
elbow	1
room	1
to	1
both	1
tendencies	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
these	1
little	1
pills	1
of	1
classical	1
learning	1
possess	1
the	1
medicinal	1
property	1
of	1
anti	1
nihilism	1
and	1
we	1
boldly	1
prescribe	1
them	1
to	1
our	1
patients	1
But	1
what	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
such	1
medicinal	1
property	1
he	1
wound	1
up	1
humorously	1
At	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
little	1
pills	1
everyone	1
laughed	1
Turovtsin	1
in	1
especial	1
roared	1
loudly	1
and	1
jovially	1
glad	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
something	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
ever	1
looked	1
for	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
conversation	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
inviting	1
Pestsov	1
With	1
Pestsov	1
intellectual	1
conversation	1
never	1
flagged	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
Directly	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
concluded	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
jest	1
Pestsov	1
promptly	1
started	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
agree	1
even	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
had	1
that	1
aim	1
The	1
government	1
obviously	1
is	1
guided	1
by	1
abstract	1
considerations	1
and	1
remains	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
its	1
measures	1
may	1
exercise	1
The	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
for	1
instance	1
would	1
naturally	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
harmful	1
but	1
the	1
government	1
opens	1
schools	1
and	1
universities	1
for	1
women	1
And	1
the	1
conversation	1
at	1
once	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
expressed	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
confounded	1
with	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
women	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
considered	1
dangerous	1
I	1
consider	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
questions	1
are	1
inseparably	1
connected	1
together	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
vicious	1
circle	1
Woman	1
is	1
deprived	1
of	1
rights	1
from	1
lack	1
of	1
education	1
and	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
education	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
rights	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
the	1
subjection	1
of	1
women	1
is	1
so	1
complete	1
and	1
dates	1
from	1
such	1
ages	1
back	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
often	1
unwilling	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
gulf	1
that	1
separates	1
them	1
from	1
us	1
said	1
he	1
You	1
said	1
rights	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
waiting	1
till	1
Pestsov	1
had	1
finished	1
meaning	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
sitting	1
on	1
juries	1
of	1
voting	1
of	1
presiding	1
at	1
official	1
meetings	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
entering	1
the	1
civil	1
service	1
of	1
sitting	1
in	1
parliament	1
Undoubtedly	1
But	1
if	1
women	1
as	1
a	1
rare	1
exception	1
can	1
occupy	1
such	1
positions	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
are	1
wrong	1
in	1
using	1
the	1
expression	1
rights	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
correct	1
to	1
say	1
duties	1
Every	1
man	1
will	1
agree	1
that	1
in	1
doing	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
juryman	1
a	1
witness	1
a	1
telegraph	1
clerk	1
we	1
feel	1
we	1
are	1
performing	1
duties	1
And	1
therefore	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
correct	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
women	1
are	1
seeking	1
duties	1
and	1
quite	1
legitimately	1
And	1
one	1
can	1
but	1
sympathize	1
with	1
this	1
desire	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
labor	1
of	1
man	1
Quite	1
so	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
assented	1
The	1
question	1
I	1
imagine	1
is	1
simply	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
duties	1
They	1
will	1
most	1
likely	1
be	1
perfectly	1
fitted	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
when	1
education	1
has	1
become	1
general	1
among	1
them	1
We	1
see	1
this	1
How	1
about	1
the	1
proverb	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
been	1
intent	1
on	1
the	1
conversation	1
his	1
little	1
comical	1
eyes	1
twinkling	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
it	1
before	1
my	1
daughter	1
her	1
hair	1
is	1
long	1
because	1
her	1
wit	1
is	1
Just	1
what	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
before	1
their	1
emancipation	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
angrily	1
What	1
seems	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
women	1
should	1
seek	1
fresh	1
duties	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
while	1
we	1
see	1
unhappily	1
that	1
men	1
usually	1
try	1
to	1
avoid	1
them	1
Duties	1
are	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
rights	1
power	1
money	1
honor	1
those	1
are	1
what	1
women	1
are	1
seeking	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
Just	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
feel	1
injured	1
because	1
women	1
are	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
while	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
Turovtsin	1
exploded	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
roar	1
of	1
laughter	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
this	1
comparison	1
Even	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
Yes	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
t	1
nurse	1
a	1
baby	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
while	1
a	1
woman	1
No	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
Englishman	1
who	1
did	1
suckle	1
his	1
baby	1
on	1
board	1
ship	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
feeling	1
this	1
freedom	1
in	1
conversation	1
permissible	1
before	1
his	1
own	1
daughters	1
There	1
are	1
as	1
many	1
such	1
Englishmen	1
as	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
women	1
officials	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Yes	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
girl	1
to	1
do	1
who	1
has	1
no	1
family	1
put	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
thinking	1
of	1
Masha	1
Tchibisova	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
all	1
along	1
in	1
sympathizing	1
with	1
Pestsov	1
and	1
supporting	1
him	1
If	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
girl	1
were	1
thoroughly	1
sifted	1
you	1
would	1
find	1
she	1
had	1
abandoned	1
a	1
family	1
her	1
own	1
or	1
a	1
sister	1
s	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
duties	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
broke	1
in	1
unexpectedly	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
exasperation	1
probably	1
suspecting	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
But	1
we	1
take	1
our	1
stand	1
on	1
principle	1
as	1
the	1
ideal	1
replied	1
Pestsov	1
in	1
his	1
mellow	1
bass	1
Woman	1
desires	1
to	1
have	1
rights	1
to	1
be	1
independent	1
educated	1
She	1
is	1
oppressed	1
humiliated	1
by	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
disabilities	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
oppressed	1
and	1
humiliated	1
that	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
engage	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
Foundling	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
said	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
huge	1
delight	1
of	1
Turovtsin	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
mirth	1
dropped	1

asparagus	1
with	1

Chapter	1
11	1
Everyone	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
except	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Levin	1
At	1
first	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
influence	1
that	1
one	1
people	1
has	1
on	1
another	1
there	1
rose	1
to	1
Levin	1
s	1
mind	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
But	1
these	1
ideas	1
once	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
brain	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
It	1
even	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
strange	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
eager	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone	1
Kitty	1
too	1
should	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
have	1
been	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
education	1
of	1
women	1
How	1
often	1
she	1
had	1
mused	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
abroad	1
Varenka	1
of	1
her	1
painful	1
state	1
of	1
dependence	1
how	1
often	1
she	1
had	1
wondered	1
about	1
herself	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
marry	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
she	1
had	1
argued	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
She	1
and	1
Levin	1
had	1
a	1
conversation	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
yet	1
not	1
a	1
conversation	1
but	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
mysterious	1
communication	1
which	1
brought	1
them	1
every	1
moment	1
nearer	1
and	1
stirred	1
in	1
both	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
glad	1
terror	1
before	1
the	1
unknown	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
entering	1
At	1
first	1
Levin	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Kitty	1
s	1
question	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
last	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
mowing	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
and	1
had	1
met	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
You	1
were	1
probably	1
only	1
just	1
awake	1
Your	1
mother	1
was	1
asleep	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
exquisite	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
along	1
wondering	1
who	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
four	1
in	1
hand	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
splendid	1
set	1
of	1
four	1
horses	1
with	1
bells	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
you	1
flashed	1
by	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
you	1
were	1
sitting	1
like	1
this	1
holding	1
the	1
strings	1
of	1
your	1
cap	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
thinking	1
awfully	1
deeply	1
about	1
something	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
How	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
thinking	1
about	1
then	1
Something	1
important	1
Wasn	1
t	1
I	1
dreadfully	1
untidy	1
she	1
wondered	1
but	1
seeing	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
ecstasy	1
these	1
reminiscences	1
called	1
up	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
good	1
She	1
blushed	1
and	1
laughed	1
with	1
delight	1
Really	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
How	1
nicely	1
Turovtsin	1
laughs	1
said	1
Levin	1
admiring	1
his	1
moist	1
eyes	1
and	1
shaking	1
chest	1
Have	1
you	1
known	1
him	1
long	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
Oh	1
everyone	1
knows	1
him	1
And	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
horrid	1
man	1
Not	1
horrid	1
but	1
nothing	1
in	1
him	1
Oh	1
you	1
re	1
wrong	1
And	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
up	1
thinking	1
so	1
directly	1
said	1
Kitty	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
too	1
but	1
he	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
awfully	1
nice	1
and	1
wonderfully	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
gold	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
heart	1
he	1
has	1
We	1
are	1
great	1
friends	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
very	1
well	1
Last	1
winter	1
soon	1
after	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
confiding	1
smile	1
all	1
Dolly	1
s	1
children	1
had	1
scarlet	1
fever	1
and	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
And	1
only	1
fancy	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
he	1
felt	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
stayed	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
Yes	1
and	1
for	1
three	1
weeks	1
he	1
stopped	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
like	1
a	1
nurse	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
about	1
Turovtsin	1
in	1
the	1
scarlet	1
fever	1
she	1
said	1
bending	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
wonderful	1
noble	1
said	1
Dolly	1
glancing	1
towards	1
Turovtsin	1
who	1
had	1
become	1
aware	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1
gently	1
to	1
him	1
Levin	1
glanced	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
Turovtsin	1
and	1
wondered	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
realized	1
all	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
goodness	1
before	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
never	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
people	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
gaily	1
genuinely	1
expressing	1
what	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
Chapter	1
12	1
Connected	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
inequality	1
of	1
rights	1
in	1
marriage	1
improper	1
to	1
discuss	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
Pestsov	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
during	1
dinner	1
touched	1
upon	1
these	1
questions	1
but	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
carefully	1
drew	1
him	1
off	1
them	1
When	1
they	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
Pestsov	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
them	1
but	1
addressing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
began	1
to	1
expound	1
the	1
chief	1
ground	1
of	1
inequality	1
The	1
inequality	1
in	1
marriage	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
infidelity	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
infidelity	1
of	1
the	1
husband	1
are	1
punished	1
unequally	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
by	1
public	1
opinion	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
cigar	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
smoke	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
answered	1
calmly	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
purposely	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Pestsov	1
with	1
a	1
chilly	1
smile	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
view	1
has	1
a	1
foundation	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
But	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
Turovtsin	1
broke	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
addressing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
You	1
heard	1
perhaps	1
about	1
Pryatchnikov	1
said	1
Turovtsin	1
warmed	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
champagne	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
and	1
long	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
had	1
weighed	1
on	1
him	1
Vasya	1
Pryatchnikov	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
damp	1
red	1
lips	1
addressing	1
himself	1
principally	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
guest	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
today	1
he	1
fought	1
a	1
duel	1
with	1
Kvitsky	1
at	1
Tver	1
and	1
has	1
killed	1
him	1
Just	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
seems	1
that	1
one	1
bruises	1
oneself	1
on	1
a	1
sore	1
place	1
so	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
would	1
by	1
ill	1
luck	1
fall	1
every	1
moment	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
sore	1
spot	1
He	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
got	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
away	1
but	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
himself	1
inquired	1
with	1
curiosity	1
What	1
did	1
Pryatchnikov	1
fight	1
about	1
His	1
wife	1
Acted	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
did	1
Called	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
shot	1
him	1
Ah	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
indifferently	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
Dolly	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
smile	1
meeting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
drawing	1
room	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
Let	1
s	1
sit	1
here	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
indifference	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
lifted	1
eyebrows	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectedly	1
It	1
s	1
fortunate	1
said	1
he	1
especially	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
excuse	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
taking	1
leave	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
start	1
tomorrow	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
innocence	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
growing	1
pale	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
quivering	1
with	1
anger	1
at	1
this	1
frigid	1
unfeeling	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
calmly	1
intending	1
to	1
ruin	1
her	1
innocent	1
friend	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
desperate	1
resolution	1
looking	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
about	1
Anna	1
you	1
made	1
me	1
no	1
answer	1
How	1
is	1
she	1
She	1
is	1
I	1
believe	1
quite	1
well	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
replied	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
forgive	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
but	1
I	1
love	1
Anna	1
as	1
a	1
sister	1
and	1
esteem	1
her	1
I	1
beg	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
wrong	1
between	1
you	1
what	1
fault	1
do	1
you	1
find	1
with	1
her	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
frowned	1
and	1
almost	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
dropped	1
his	1
head	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
your	1
husband	1
has	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
grounds	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
attitude	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
eyeing	1
with	1
displeasure	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
across	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
I	1
don	1
t	1

it	1
I	1
don	1

Dolly	1
said	1
clasping	1
her	1
bony	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
gesture	1
She	1
rose	1
quickly	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
sleeve	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
disturbed	1
here	1
Come	1
this	1
way	1
please	1
Dolly	1
s	1
agitation	1
had	1
an	1
effect	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
submissively	1
followed	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
schoolroom	1
They	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
an	1
oilcloth	1
cut	1
in	1
slits	1
by	1
penknives	1
I	1
don	1

I	1

Dolly	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
his	1
glance	1
that	1
avoided	1
her	1
One	1
cannot	1
disbelieve	1
facts	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
an	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
facts	1
But	1
what	1
has	1
she	1
done	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
What	1
precisely	1
has	1
she	1
done	1
She	1
has	1
forsaken	1
her	1
duty	1
and	1
deceived	1
her	1
husband	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
said	1
he	1
No	1
no	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
No	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
said	1
Dolly	1
putting	1
her	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
temples	1
and	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
coldly	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
alone	1
meaning	1
to	1
signify	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
his	1
conviction	1
but	1
this	1
warm	1
defense	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
him	1
reopened	1
his	1
wound	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
greater	1
heat	1
It	1
is	1
extremely	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
when	1
a	1
wife	1
herself	1
informs	1
her	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
informs	1
him	1
that	1
eight	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
son	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
mistake	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
begin	1
life	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
with	1
a	1
snort	1
Anna	1
and	1
sin	1
I	1
cannot	1
connect	1
them	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
he	1
said	1
now	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
Dolly	1
s	1
kindly	1
troubled	1
face	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
tongue	1
was	1
being	1
loosened	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
for	1
doubt	1
to	1
be	1
still	1
possible	1
When	1
I	1
doubted	1
I	1
was	1
miserable	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
now	1
When	1
I	1
doubted	1
I	1
had	1
hope	1
but	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
hope	1
and	1
still	1
I	1
doubt	1
of	1
everything	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
such	1
doubt	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
even	1
hate	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
sometimes	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
unhappy	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
glanced	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
innocence	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
began	1
to	1
totter	1
Oh	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
awful	1
But	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
resolved	1
on	1
a	1
divorce	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
on	1
extreme	1
measures	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
Nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
Oh	1
no	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
What	1
is	1
horrible	1
in	1
a	1
trouble	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
that	1
one	1
cannot	1
as	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
in	1
loss	1
in	1
death	1
bear	1
one	1
s	1
trouble	1
in	1
peace	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
act	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
though	1
guessing	1
her	1
thought	1
One	1
must	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
humiliating	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
is	1
placed	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
`a	1
trois	1
I	1
understand	1
I	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
said	1
Dolly	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
sank	1
She	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
grief	1
in	1
her	1
family	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
an	1
impulsive	1
movement	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
with	1
an	1
imploring	1
gesture	1
But	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
Christian	1
Think	1
of	1
her	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
if	1
you	1
cast	1
her	1
off	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
His	1
face	1
turned	1
red	1
in	1
patches	1
and	1
his	1
dim	1
eyes	1
looked	1
straight	1

at	1
that	1
moment	1
pitied	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
That	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
indeed	1
when	1
she	1
herself	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
humiliation	1
I	1
left	1
everything	1
as	1
of	1
old	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
reform	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
And	1
with	1
what	1
result	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
regard	1
the	1
slightest	1
request	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
observe	1

One	1
may	1
save	1
anyone	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
ruined	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
nature	1
is	1
so	1
corrupt	1
so	1
depraved	1
that	1
ruin	1
itself	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
salvation	1

Anything	1

Darya	1

But	1
what	1
is	1
anything	1
No	1

said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
raising	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
The	1
recollection	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
last	1
act	1
had	1
so	1
incensed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
frigid	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
your	1
sympathy	1

I	1
must	1
be	1
going	1
he	1

No	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
ruin	1
her	1
Wait	1
a	1
little	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
myself	1
I	1
was	1
married	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
deceived	1
me	1
in	1
anger	1
and	1
jealousy	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thrown	1
up	1
everything	1
I	1
would	1
myself	1
But	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
myself	1
again	1
and	1
who	1

Anna	1

And	1
here	1

my	1

back	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
feels	1
his	1
fault	1
is	1
growing	1
purer	1
better	1
and	1
I	1
live	1

I	1
have	1
forgiven	1
