sprung	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
his	1

He	1
shook	1
himself	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shrill	1
loud	1
voice	1
Forgive	1
I	1
cannot	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
and	1
I	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
wrong	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
everything	1
for	1
this	1
woman	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
trodden	1
it	1
all	1
in	1

which	1

I	1

not	1
a	1

I	1
have	1
never	1
hated	1
anyone	1
but	1
I	1
hate	1
her	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
soul	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
even	1
forgive	1
her	1
because	1
I	1
hate	1
her	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
wrong	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
me	1

Darya	1

timorously	1
Alexey	1

smiled	1
contemptuously	1
That	1
he	1

it	1
could	1
not	1

Chapter	1
13	1
When	1
they	1
rose	1
from	1
table	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
follow	1
Kitty	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
she	1
might	1
dislike	1
this	1
as	1
too	1
obviously	1
paying	1
her	1
attention	1
He	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
ring	1
of	1
men	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Kitty	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
He	1
did	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
effort	1
keep	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
always	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
like	1
everyone	1
always	1
The	1
conversation	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
village	1
commune	1
in	1
which	1
Pestsov	1
saw	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
special	1
principle	1
called	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
choral	1
principle	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
Pestsov	1
nor	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
special	1
attitude	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
both	1
admitting	1
and	1
not	1
admitting	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
commune	1
But	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
them	1
simply	1
trying	1
to	1
reconcile	1
and	1
soften	1
their	1
differences	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
himself	1
and	1
even	1
less	1
so	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
everyone	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
He	1
knew	1
now	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
importance	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
moving	1
across	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Without	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
turning	1
round	1
She	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
with	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
towards	1
the	1
piano	1
said	1
he	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
That	1
s	1
something	1
I	1
miss	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
music	1
No	1
we	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
fetch	1
you	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
rewarding	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
gift	1
for	1
coming	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
argue	1
for	1
No	1
one	1
ever	1
convinces	1
anyone	1
you	1
know	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
said	1
Levin	1
it	1
generally	1
happens	1
that	1
one	1
argues	1
warmly	1
simply	1
because	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
one	1
s	1
opponent	1
wants	1
to	1
prove	1
Levin	1
had	1
often	1
noticed	1
in	1
discussions	1
between	1
the	1
most	1
intelligent	1
people	1
that	1
after	1
enormous	1
efforts	1
and	1
an	1
enormous	1
expenditure	1
of	1
logical	1
subtleties	1
and	1
words	1
the	1
disputants	1
finally	1
arrived	1
at	1
being	1
aware	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
struggling	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
argument	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
both	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
liked	1
different	1
things	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
define	1
what	1
they	1
liked	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
attacked	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
had	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
suddenly	1
in	1
a	1
discussion	1
grasping	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
opponent	1
liked	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
liking	1
it	1
too	1
and	1
immediately	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
agreeing	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
arguments	1
fell	1
away	1
as	1
useless	1
Sometimes	1
too	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
the	1
opposite	1
expressing	1
at	1
last	1
what	1
he	1
liked	1
himself	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
devising	1
arguments	1
to	1
defend	1
and	1
chancing	1
to	1
express	1
it	1
well	1
and	1
genuinely	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
his	1
opponent	1
at	1
once	1
agreeing	1
and	1
ceasing	1
to	1
dispute	1
his	1
position	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
She	1
knitted	1
her	1
brow	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
But	1
directly	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
illustrate	1
his	1
meaning	1
she	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
I	1
know	1
one	1
must	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
arguing	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
precious	1
to	1
him	1
then	1
one	1
can	1
She	1
had	1
completely	1
guessed	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
badly	1
expressed	1
idea	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
joyfully	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
this	1
transition	1
from	1
the	1
confused	1
verbose	1
discussion	1
with	1
Pestsov	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
this	1
laconic	1
clear	1
almost	1
wordless	1
communication	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
ideas	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
Kitty	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
card	1
table	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
chalk	1
began	1
drawing	1
diverging	1
circles	1
over	1
the	1
new	1
green	1
cloth	1
They	1
began	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
started	1
at	1
dinner	1
the	1
liberty	1
and	1
occupations	1
of	1
women	1
Levin	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
that	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
marry	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
duties	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
He	1
supported	1
this	1
view	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
no	1
family	1
can	1
get	1
on	1
without	1
women	1
to	1
help	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
family	1
poor	1
or	1
rich	1
there	1
are	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
nurses	1
either	1
relations	1
or	1
hired	1
No	1
said	1
Kitty	1
blushing	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
boldly	1
with	1
her	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
a	1
girl	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
circumstanced	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
without	1
humiliation	1
while	1
she	1
herself	1
At	1
the	1
hint	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
Oh	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
Yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
you	1
re	1
right	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
Pestsov	1
had	1
been	1
maintaining	1
at	1
dinner	1
of	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
woman	1
simply	1
from	1
getting	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
s	1
existence	1
and	1
its	1
humiliation	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
heart	1
and	1
loving	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
terror	1
and	1
humiliation	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
up	1
his	1
arguments	1
A	1
silence	1
followed	1
She	1
was	1
still	1
drawing	1
with	1
the	1
chalk	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
shining	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
light	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
mood	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
continually	1
growing	1
tension	1
of	1
happiness	1
Ah	1
I	1
ve	1
scribbled	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
chalk	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
without	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
chalk	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
I	1
ve	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing	1
He	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
caressing	1
though	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
Please	1
ask	1
it	1
Here	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
initial	1
letters	1
w	1
y	1
t	1
m	1
i	1
c	1
n	1
b	1
d	1
t	1
m	1
n	1
o	1
t	1
These	1
letters	1
meant	1
When	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
did	1
that	1
mean	1
never	1
or	1
then	1
There	1
seemed	1
no	1
likelihood	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
this	1
complicated	1
sentence	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
life	1
depended	1
on	1
her	1
understanding	1
the	1
words	1
She	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
seriously	1
then	1
leaned	1
her	1
puckered	1
brow	1
on	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
she	1
stole	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
asking	1
him	1
Is	1
it	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
n	1
that	1
stood	1
for	1
never	1
It	1
means	1
never	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
He	1
quickly	1
rubbed	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
chalk	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
She	1
wrote	1
t	1
i	1
c	1
n	1
a	1
d	1
Dolly	1
was	1
completely	1
comforted	1
in	1
the	1
depression	1
caused	1
by	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
when	1
she	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
figures	1
Kitty	1
with	1
the	1
chalk	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
shy	1
and	1
happy	1
smile	1
looking	1
upwards	1
at	1
Levin	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
figure	1
bending	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
glowing	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
one	1
minute	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
on	1
her	1
He	1
was	1
suddenly	1
radiant	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
It	1
meant	1
Then	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
differently	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
questioningly	1
timidly	1
Only	1
then	1
Yes	1
her	1
smile	1
answered	1
And	1
n	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
asked	1
Well	1
read	1
this	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
should	1
like	1
so	1
much	1
she	1
wrote	1
the	1
initial	1
letters	1
i	1
y	1
c	1
f	1
a	1
f	1
w	1
h	1
	1
This	1
meant	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
forget	1
and	1
forgive	1
what	1
happened	1
He	1
snatched	1
the	1
chalk	1
with	1
nervous	1
trembling	1
fingers	1
and	1
breaking	1
it	1
wrote	1
the	1
initial	1
letters	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
phrase	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
forget	1
and	1
to	1
forgive	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
you	1
She	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
waver	1
I	1
understand	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
wrote	1
a	1
long	1
phrase	1
She	1
understood	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
without	1
asking	1
him	1
Is	1
it	1
this	1
took	1
the	1
chalk	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
answered	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
and	1
often	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
He	1
was	1
stupefied	1
with	1
happiness	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
supply	1
the	1
word	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
charming	1
eyes	1
beaming	1
with	1
happiness	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
he	1
needed	1
to	1
know	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
three	1
letters	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
writing	1
when	1
she	1
read	1
them	1
over	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
herself	1
finished	1
and	1
wrote	1
the	1
answer	1
Yes	1
You	1
re	1
playing	1
secr'etaire	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
really	1
be	1
getting	1
along	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
theater	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
escorted	1
Kitty	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
In	1
their	1
conversation	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
Chapter	1
14	1
When	1
Kitty	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
uneasiness	1
without	1
her	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
impatient	1
longing	1
to	1
get	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
tomorrow	1
morning	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
again	1
and	1
be	1
plighted	1
to	1
her	1
forever	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
afraid	1
as	1
though	1
of	1
death	1
of	1
those	1
fourteen	1
hours	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
without	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
someone	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
to	1
kill	1
time	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
companion	1
most	1
congenial	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
soir'ee	1
in	1
reality	1
to	1
the	1
ballet	1
Levin	1
only	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
The	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
showed	1
Levin	1
that	1
he	1
comprehended	1
that	1
feeling	1
fittingly	1
Oh	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
die	1
yet	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
pressing	1
Levin	1
s	1
hand	1
with	1
emotion	1
N	1
n	1
no	1
said	1
Levin	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
too	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
him	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
congratulation	1
saying	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
you	1
have	1
met	1
Kitty	1
again	1
One	1
must	1
value	1
old	1
friends	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
how	1
lofty	1
and	1
beyond	1
her	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
and	1
she	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
it	1
Levin	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
he	1
attached	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
meeting	1
Well	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
with	1
you	1
May	1
I	1
What	1
for	1
Yes	1
come	1
along	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiling	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
today	1
With	1
me	1
Happiness	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
Levin	1
letting	1
down	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
they	1
were	1
driving	1
in	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
stifling	1
It	1
s	1
happiness	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
married	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiled	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
she	1
seems	1
a	1
nice	1
gi	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
beginning	1
Don	1
t	1
say	1
it	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
it	1
shouted	1
Levin	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
muffling	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
nice	1
girl	1
were	1
such	1
simple	1
humble	1
words	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
harmony	1
with	1
his	1
feeling	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
laughed	1
outright	1
a	1
merry	1
laugh	1
which	1
was	1
rare	1
with	1
him	1
Well	1
anyway	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
That	1
you	1
may	1
do	1
tomorrow	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
Nothing	1
nothing	1
silence	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
muffling	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
he	1
added	1
I	1
do	1
like	1
you	1
so	1
Well	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
discussion	1
about	1
today	1
asked	1
Levin	1
never	1
ceasing	1
smiling	1
They	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
Levin	1
heard	1
the	1
secretary	1
hesitatingly	1
read	1
the	1
minutes	1
which	1
he	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
understand	1
but	1
Levin	1
saw	1
from	1
this	1
secretary	1
s	1
face	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
nice	1
kind	1
hearted	1
person	1
he	1
was	1
This	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
his	1
confusion	1
and	1
embarrassment	1
in	1
reading	1
the	1
minutes	1
Then	1
the	1
discussion	1
began	1
They	1
were	1
disputing	1
about	1
the	1
misappropriation	1
of	1
certain	1
sums	1
and	1
the	1
laying	1
of	1
certain	1
pipes	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
very	1
cutting	1
to	1
two	1
members	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
at	1
great	1
length	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
another	1
member	1
scribbling	1
something	1
on	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
paper	1
began	1
timidly	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
afterwards	1
answered	1
him	1
very	1
viciously	1
and	1
delightfully	1
And	1
then	1
Sviazhsky	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
too	1
said	1
something	1
too	1
very	1
handsomely	1
and	1
nobly	1
Levin	1
listened	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
these	1
missing	1
sums	1
and	1
these	1
pipes	1
were	1
not	1
anything	1
real	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
angry	1
but	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
nicest	1
kindest	1
people	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
as	1
happy	1
and	1
charming	1
as	1
possible	1
among	1
them	1
They	1
did	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
enjoying	1
it	1
What	1
struck	1
Levin	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
through	1
them	1
all	1
today	1
and	1
from	1
little	1
almost	1
imperceptible	1
signs	1
knew	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
each	1
and	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
good	1
at	1
heart	1
And	1
Levin	1
himself	1
in	1
particular	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
That	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
friendly	1
affectionate	1
way	1
even	1
those	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
Well	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
asked	1
him	1
Very	1
much	1
I	1
never	1
supposed	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
interesting	1
Capital	1
Splendid	1
Sviazhsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Levin	1
and	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
tea	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
was	1
utterly	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
comprehend	1
or	1
recall	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
disliked	1
in	1
Sviazhsky	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
wonderfully	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
Most	1
delighted	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
asked	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
And	1
from	1
a	1
queer	1
association	1
of	1
ideas	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
marriage	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
more	1
suitably	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
Sviazhsky	1
questioned	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
improvements	1
on	1
his	1
estate	1
presupposing	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
not	1
done	1
already	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
annoy	1
Levin	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
right	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
was	1
of	1
little	1
value	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wonderful	1
softness	1
and	1
consideration	1
with	1
which	1
Sviazhsky	1
avoided	1
fully	1
expressing	1
his	1
correct	1
view	1
The	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
Sviazhsky	1
household	1
were	1
particularly	1
delightful	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
already	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
him	1
saying	1
nothing	1
merely	1
from	1
delicacy	1
He	1
stayed	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
hour	1
two	1
three	1
talking	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
subjects	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
boring	1
them	1
dreadfully	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
past	1
their	1
bedtime	1
Sviazhsky	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
yawning	1
and	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
humor	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
in	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
Levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
hotel	1
and	1
was	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
all	1
alone	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
impatience	1
he	1
had	1
ten	1
hours	1
still	1
left	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
The	1
servant	1
whose	1
turn	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
lighted	1
his	1
candles	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
Levin	1
stopped	1
him	1
This	1
servant	1
Yegor	1
whom	1
Levin	1
had	1
noticed	1
before	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
intelligent	1
excellent	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
Well	1
Yegor	1
it	1
s	1
hard	1
work	1
not	1
sleeping	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
One	1
s	1
got	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
work	1
you	1
see	1
In	1
a	1
gentleman	1
s	1
house	1
it	1
s	1
easier	1
but	1
then	1
here	1
one	1
makes	1
more	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
Yegor	1
had	1
a	1
family	1
three	1
boys	1
and	1
a	1
daughter	1
a	1
sempstress	1
whom	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
marry	1
to	1
a	1
cashier	1
in	1
a	1
saddler	1
s	1
shop	1
Levin	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
informed	1
Yegor	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
in	1
marriage	1
the	1
great	1
thing	1
was	1
love	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
love	1
one	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
happy	1
for	1
happiness	1
rests	1
only	1
on	1
oneself	1
Yegor	1
listened	1
attentively	1
and	1
obviously	1
quite	1
took	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
idea	1
but	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
assent	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
enunciated	1
greatly	1
to	1
Levin	1
s	1
surprise	1
the	1
observation	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
good	1
masters	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
masters	1
and	1
now	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
employer	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
Wonderfully	1
good	1
hearted	1
fellow	1
thought	1
Levin	1
Well	1
but	1
you	1
yourself	1
Yegor	1
when	1
you	1
got	1
married	1
did	1
you	1
love	1
your	1
wife	1
Ay	1
and	1
why	1
not	1
responded	1
Yegor	1
And	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
Yegor	1
too	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
excited	1
state	1
and	1
intending	1
to	1
express	1
all	1
his	1
most	1
heartfelt	1
emotions	1
My	1
life	1
too	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
wonderful	1
one	1
From	1
a	1
child	1
up	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
with	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
apparently	1
catching	1
Levin	1
s	1
enthusiasm	1
just	1
as	1
people	1
catch	1
yawning	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
ring	1
was	1
heard	1
Yegor	1
departed	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
He	1
had	1
eaten	1
scarcely	1
anything	1
at	1
dinner	1
had	1
refused	1
tea	1
and	1
supper	1
at	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
thinking	1
of	1
supper	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
the	1
previous	1
night	1
but	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
thinking	1
of	1
sleep	1
either	1
His	1
room	1
was	1
cold	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
heat	1
He	1
opened	1
both	1
the	1
movable	1
panes	1
in	1
his	1
window	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
opposite	1
the	1
open	1
panes	1
Over	1
the	1
snow	1
covered	1
roofs	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
a	1
decorated	1
cross	1
with	1
chains	1
and	1
above	1
it	1
the	1
rising	1
triangle	1
of	1
Charles	1
s	1
Wain	1
with	1
the	1
yellowish	1
light	1
of	1
Capella	1
He	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
cross	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
stars	1
drank	1
in	1
the	1
fresh	1
freezing	1
air	1
that	1
flowed	1
evenly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
followed	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
the	1
images	1
and	1
memories	1
that	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
At	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
he	1
heard	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
peeped	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
gambler	1
Myaskin	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
club	1
He	1
walked	1
gloomily	1
frowning	1
and	1
coughing	1
Poor	1
unlucky	1
fellow	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
love	1
and	1
pity	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
him	1
but	1
remembering	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
shirt	1
on	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
pane	1
to	1
bathe	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
air	1
and	1
gaze	1
at	1
the	1
exquisite	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
silent	1
but	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
mounting	1
lurid	1
yellow	1
star	1
At	1
seven	1
o	1
clock	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
people	1
polishing	1
the	1
floors	1
and	1
bells	1
ringing	1
in	1
some	1
servants	1
department	1
and	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
frozen	1
He	1
closed	1
the	1
pane	1
washed	1
dressed	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
Chapter	1
15	1
The	1
streets	1
were	1
still	1
empty	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
The	1
visitors	1
doors	1
were	1
closed	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
asleep	1
He	1
walked	1
back	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
again	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
coffee	1
The	1
day	1
servant	1
not	1
Yegor	1
this	1
time	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
a	1
bell	1
rang	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
drink	1
coffee	1
and	1
put	1
some	1
roll	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
but	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
quite	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
roll	1
Levin	1
rejecting	1
the	1
roll	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
It	1
was	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
steps	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
In	1
the	1
house	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
just	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
cook	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
go	1
marketing	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
hours	1
more	1
All	1
that	1
night	1
and	1
morning	1
Levin	1
lived	1
perfectly	1
unconsciously	1
and	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
lifted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
material	1
life	1
He	1
had	1
eaten	1
nothing	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
for	1
two	1
nights	1
had	1
spent	1
several	1
hours	1
undressed	1
in	1
the	1
frozen	1
air	1
and	1
felt	1
not	1
simply	1
fresher	1
and	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever	1
but	1
felt	1
utterly	1
independent	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
he	1
moved	1
without	1
muscular	1
effort	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
anything	1
He	1
was	1
convinced	1
he	1
could	1
fly	1
upwards	1
or	1
lift	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
if	1
need	1
be	1
He	1
spent	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
incessantly	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
and	1
gazing	1
about	1
him	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
then	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
again	1
after	1
The	1
children	1
especially	1
going	1
to	1
school	1
the	1
bluish	1
doves	1
flying	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
roofs	1
to	1
the	1
pavement	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
loaves	1
covered	1
with	1
flour	1
thrust	1
out	1
by	1
an	1
unseen	1
hand	1
touched	1
him	1
Those	1
loaves	1
those	1
doves	1
and	1
those	1
two	1
boys	1
were	1
not	1
earthly	1
creatures	1
It	1
all	1
happened	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
a	1
boy	1
ran	1
towards	1
a	1
dove	1
and	1
glanced	1
smiling	1
at	1
Levin	1
the	1
dove	1
with	1
a	1
whir	1
of	1
her	1
wings	1
darted	1
away	1
flashing	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
amid	1
grains	1
of	1
snow	1
that	1
quivered	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
while	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
window	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
fresh	1
baked	1
bread	1
and	1
the	1
loaves	1
were	1
put	1
out	1
All	1
of	1
this	1
together	1
was	1
so	1
extraordinarily	1
nice	1
that	1
Levin	1
laughed	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
delight	1
Going	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
round	1
by	1
Gazetny	1
Place	1
and	1
Kislovka	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
hotel	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
watch	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
machines	1
and	1
swindling	1
and	1
coughing	1
their	1
morning	1
coughs	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
was	1
near	1
twelve	1
The	1
hand	1
reached	1
it	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
The	1
sledge	1
drivers	1
clearly	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
They	1
crowded	1
round	1
Levin	1
with	1
happy	1
faces	1
quarreling	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
offering	1
their	1
services	1
Trying	1
not	1
to	1
offend	1
the	1
other	1
sledge	1
drivers	1
and	1
promising	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
them	1
too	1
Levin	1
took	1
one	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
The	1
sledge	1
driver	1
was	1
splendid	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
shirt	1
collar	1
sticking	1
out	1
over	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
into	1
his	1
strong	1
full	1
blooded	1
red	1
neck	1
The	1
sledge	1
was	1
high	1
and	1
comfortable	1
and	1
altogether	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
Levin	1
never	1
drove	1
in	1
after	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
gallop	1
but	1
didn	1
t	1
seem	1
to	1
move	1
The	1
driver	1
knew	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
with	1
a	1
curve	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
Wo	1
especially	1
indicative	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
fare	1
The	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
hall	1
porter	1
certainly	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
This	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
smile	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
said	1
Well	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
since	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Not	1
only	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
delighted	1
and	1
making	1
efforts	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
joy	1
Looking	1
into	1
his	1
kindly	1
old	1
eyes	1
Levin	1
realized	1
even	1
something	1
new	1
in	1
his	1
happiness	1
Are	1
they	1
up	1
Pray	1
walk	1
in	1
Leave	1
it	1
here	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
as	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
hat	1
That	1
meant	1
something	1
To	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
announce	1
your	1
honor	1
asked	1
the	1
footman	1
The	1
footman	1
though	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
school	1
of	1
footmen	1
a	1
dandy	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
hearted	1
good	1
fellow	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
The	1
princess	1
the	1
prince	1
the	1
young	1
princess	1
said	1
Levin	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
She	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
her	1
ringlets	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
were	1
beaming	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
skirt	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
vanished	1
from	1
Levin	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
joyful	1
terror	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
was	1
in	1
great	1
haste	1
and	1
leaving	1
him	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
Directly	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
swift	1
swift	1
light	1
steps	1
sounded	1
on	1
the	1
parquet	1
and	1
his	1
bliss	1
his	1
life	1
himself	1
what	1
was	1
best	1
in	1
himself	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
sought	1
and	1
longed	1
for	1
was	1
quickly	1
so	1
quickly	1
approaching	1
him	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
but	1
seemed	1
by	1
some	1
unseen	1
force	1
to	1
float	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
clear	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
frightened	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
bliss	1
of	1
love	1
that	1
flooded	1
his	1
heart	1
Those	1
eyes	1
were	1
shining	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
blinding	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
light	1
of	1
love	1
She	1
stopped	1
still	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
touching	1
him	1
Her	1
hands	1
rose	1
and	1
dropped	1
onto	1
his	1
shoulders	1
She	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
she	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
given	1
herself	1
up	1
entirely	1
shy	1
and	1
happy	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
her	1
mouth	1
that	1
sought	1
his	1
kiss	1
She	1
too	1
had	1
not	1
slept	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
Her	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
had	1
consented	1
without	1
demur	1
and	1
were	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
happiness	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
her	1
happiness	1
and	1
his	1
She	1
had	1
got	1
ready	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
delighted	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
shy	1
and	1
ashamed	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
herself	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
She	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
steps	1
and	1
voice	1
and	1
had	1
waited	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
to	1
go	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
Without	1
thinking	1
without	1
asking	1
herself	1
how	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
mamma	1
she	1
said	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
desecrating	1
the	1
loftiness	1
of	1
his	1
emotion	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
as	1
that	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
instead	1
of	1
words	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
tears	1
of	1
happiness	1
were	1
welling	1
up	1
He	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
choked	1
voice	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
believe	1
you	1
love	1
me	1
dear	1
She	1
smiled	1
at	1
that	1
dear	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
timidity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
Yes	1
she	1
said	1
significantly	1
deliberately	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
happy	1
Not	1
letting	1
go	1
his	1
hands	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
The	1
princess	1
seeing	1
them	1
breathed	1
quickly	1
and	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
then	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
step	1
Levin	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
hugging	1
his	1
head	1
kissed	1
him	1
wetting	1
his	1
cheeks	1
with	1
her	1
tears	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
settled	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
Love	1
her	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
Kitty	1
You	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
settling	1
things	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
trying	1
to	1
seem	1
unmoved	1
but	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
wet	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
ve	1
long	1
always	1
wished	1
for	1
this	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
taking	1
Levin	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
drawing	1
him	1
towards	1
himself	1
Even	1
when	1
this	1
little	1
feather	1
head	1
fancied	1
Papa	1
shrieked	1
Kitty	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
Well	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
plea	1
Oh	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
am	1
He	1
embraced	1
Kitty	1
kissed	1
her	1
face	1
her	1
hand	1
her	1
face	1
again	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
over	1
her	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
over	1
Levin	1
a	1
new	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
till	1
then	1
so	1
little	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
slowly	1
and	1
tenderly	1
Kitty	1
kissed	1
his	1
muscular	1
hand	1
Chapter	1
16	1
The	1
princess	1
sat	1
in	1
her	1
armchair	1
silent	1
and	1
smiling	1
the	1
prince	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
Kitty	1
stood	1
by	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
chair	1
still	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
All	1
were	1
silent	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
put	1
everything	1
into	1
words	1
and	1
to	1
translate	1
all	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
into	1
practical	1
questions	1
And	1
all	1
equally	1
felt	1
this	1
strange	1
and	1
painful	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
When	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
benediction	1
and	1
announcement	1
And	1
when	1
s	1
the	1
wedding	1
to	1
be	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
Alexander	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
pointing	1
to	1
Levin	1
he	1
s	1
the	1
principal	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
When	1
said	1
Levin	1
blushing	1
Tomorrow	1
If	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
the	1
benediction	1
today	1
and	1
the	1
wedding	1
tomorrow	1
Come	1
mon	1
cher	1
that	1
s	1
nonsense	1
Well	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
He	1
s	1
quite	1
mad	1
No	1
why	1
so	1
Well	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
smiling	1
delighted	1
at	1
this	1
haste	1
How	1
about	1
the	1
trousseau	1
Will	1
there	1
really	1
be	1
a	1
trousseau	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
Levin	1
thought	1
with	1
horror	1
But	1
can	1
the	1
trousseau	1
and	1
the	1
benediction	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
it	1
spoil	1
my	1
happiness	1
Nothing	1
can	1
spoil	1
it	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
Kitty	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
least	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
trousseau	1
Then	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
thought	1
Oh	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
only	1
said	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
he	1
said	1
apologetically	1
We	1
ll	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
then	1
The	1
benediction	1
and	1
announcement	1
can	1
take	1
place	1
now	1
That	1
s	1
very	1
well	1
The	1
princess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
kissed	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
her	1
embraced	1
her	1
and	1
tenderly	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lover	1
kissed	1
her	1
several	1
times	1
smiling	1
The	1
old	1
people	1
were	1
obviously	1
muddled	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
know	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
love	1
again	1
or	1
their	1
daughter	1
When	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
gone	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
betrothed	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
He	1
was	1
self	1
possessed	1
now	1
and	1
could	1
speak	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
How	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
I	1
never	1
hoped	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
sure	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
And	1
I	1
she	1
said	1
Even	1
when	1
She	1
stopped	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
resolutely	1
with	1
her	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
Even	1
when	1
I	1
thrust	1
from	1
me	1
my	1
happiness	1
I	1
always	1
loved	1
you	1
alone	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
Can	1
you	1
forgive	1
that	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
You	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
This	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
He	1
had	1
resolved	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
chaste	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
believer	1
It	1
was	1
agonizing	1
but	1
he	1
considered	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
both	1
these	1
facts	1
No	1
not	1
now	1
later	1
he	1
said	1
Very	1
well	1
later	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
certainly	1
tell	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
anything	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
everything	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
settled	1
He	1
added	1
Settled	1
that	1
you	1
ll	1
take	1
me	1
whatever	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
give	1
me	1
up	1
Yes	1
Yes	1
yes	1
Their	1
conversation	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
who	1
with	1
an	1
affected	1
but	1
tender	1
smile	1
came	1
to	1
congratulate	1
her	1
favorite	1
pupil	1
Before	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
servants	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
their	1
congratulations	1
Then	1
relations	1
arrived	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
blissful	1
absurdity	1
from	1
which	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
emerge	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
wedding	1
Levin	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
state	1
of	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
discomfort	1
but	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
increasing	1
He	1
felt	1
continually	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
was	1
being	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
everything	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
and	1
it	1
all	1
gave	1
him	1
happiness	1
He	1
had	1
thought	1
his	1
engagement	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
like	1
others	1
that	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
engaged	1
couples	1
would	1
spoil	1
his	1
special	1
happiness	1
but	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
his	1
doing	1
exactly	1
as	1
other	1
people	1
did	1
and	1
his	1
happiness	1
being	1
only	1
increased	1
thereby	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
special	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
unlike	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
happened	1
Now	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
sweetmeats	1
to	1
eat	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Linon	1
and	1
Levin	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
buy	1
sweetmeats	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
bouquets	1
from	1
Fomin	1
s	1
Oh	1
are	1
they	1
wanted	1
And	1
he	1
drove	1
to	1
Fomin	1
s	1
His	1
brother	1
offered	1
to	1
lend	1
him	1
money	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
so	1
many	1
expenses	1
presents	1
to	1
give	1
Oh	1
are	1
presents	1
wanted	1
And	1
he	1
galloped	1
to	1
Foulde	1
s	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
confectioner	1
s	1
and	1
at	1
Fomin	1
s	1
and	1
at	1
Foulde	1
s	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
expected	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
prided	1
themselves	1
on	1
his	1
happiness	1
just	1
as	1
everyone	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
during	1
those	1
days	1
What	1
was	1
extraordinary	1
was	1
that	1
everyone	1
not	1
only	1
liked	1
him	1
but	1
even	1
people	1
previously	1
unsympathetic	1
cold	1
and	1
callous	1
were	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
him	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
everything	1
treated	1
his	1
feeling	1
with	1
tenderness	1
and	1
delicacy	1
and	1
shared	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
happiest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
his	1
betrothed	1
was	1
beyond	1
perfection	1
Kitty	1
too	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
When	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
ventured	1
to	1
hint	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
hoped	1
for	1
something	1
better	1
Kitty	1
was	1
so	1
angry	1
and	1
proved	1
so	1
conclusively	1
that	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
Levin	1
that	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
presence	1
never	1
met	1
Levin	1
without	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
ecstatic	1
admiration	1
The	1
confession	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
painful	1
incident	1
of	1
this	1
time	1
He	1
consulted	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
sanction	1
gave	1
Kitty	1
his	1
diary	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
written	1
the	1
confession	1
that	1
tortured	1
him	1
He	1
had	1
written	1
this	1
diary	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
his	1
future	1
wife	1
Two	1
things	1
caused	1
him	1
anguish	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
purity	1
and	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
faith	1
His	1
confession	1
of	1
unbelief	1
passed	1
unnoticed	1
She	1
was	1
religious	1
had	1
never	1
doubted	1
the	1
truths	1
of	1
religion	1
but	1
his	1
external	1
unbelief	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
Through	1
love	1
she	1
knew	1
all	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
she	1
saw	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
soul	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
unbelieving	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
account	1
The	1
other	1
confession	1
set	1
her	1
weeping	1
bitterly	1
Levin	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
inner	1
struggle	1
handed	1
her	1
his	1
diary	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
secrets	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
realized	1
what	1
an	1
effect	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
on	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
put	1
himself	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
house	1
before	1
the	1
theater	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
tear	1
stained	1
pitiful	1
sweet	1
face	1
miserable	1
with	1
suffering	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
undo	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
abyss	1
that	1
separated	1
his	1
shameful	1
past	1
from	1
her	1
dovelike	1
purity	1
and	1
was	1
appalled	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
Take	1
them	1
take	1
these	1
dreadful	1
books	1
she	1
said	1
pushing	1
away	1
the	1
notebooks	1
lying	1
before	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
them	1
me	1
No	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
anyway	1
she	1
added	1
touched	1
by	1
his	1
despairing	1
face	1
But	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
awful	1
His	1
head	1
sank	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
He	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
he	1
whispered	1
Yes	1
I	1
forgive	1
you	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
terrible	1
But	1
his	1
happiness	1
was	1
so	1
immense	1
that	1
this	1
confession	1
did	1
not	1
shatter	1
it	1
it	1
only	1
added	1
another	1
shade	1
to	1
it	1
She	1
forgave	1
him	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
of	1
her	1
morally	1
bowed	1
down	1
lower	1
than	1
ever	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
prized	1
more	1
highly	1
than	1
ever	1
his	1
undeserved	1
happiness	1
Chapter	1
17	1
Unconsciously	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
the	1
conversations	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
during	1
and	1
after	1
dinner	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
solitary	1
room	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
words	1
about	1
forgiveness	1
had	1
aroused	1
in	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
annoyance	1
The	1
applicability	1
or	1
non	1
applicability	1
of	1
the	1
Christian	1
precept	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
case	1
was	1
too	1
difficult	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
discussed	1
lightly	1
and	1
this	1
question	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
been	1
answered	1
by	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
in	1
the	1
negative	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
what	1
stuck	1
most	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
was	1
the	1
phrase	1
of	1
stupid	1
good	1
natured	1
Turovtsin	1
Acted	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
he	1
did	1
Called	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
shot	1
him	1
	1
Everyone	1
had	1
apparently	1
shared	1
this	1
feeling	1
though	1
from	1
politeness	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
expressed	1
it	1
But	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
settled	1
it	1
s	1
useless	1
thinking	1
about	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
told	1
himself	1
And	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
journey	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
revision	1
work	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
porter	1
who	1
escorted	1
him	1
where	1
his	1
man	1
was	1
The	1
porter	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
gone	1
out	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
ordered	1
tea	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
him	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
guidebook	1
began	1
considering	1
the	1
route	1
of	1
his	1
journey	1
Two	1
telegrams	1
said	1
his	1
manservant	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
your	1
excellency	1
I	1
d	1
only	1
just	1
that	1
minute	1
gone	1
out	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
the	1
telegrams	1
and	1
opened	1
them	1
The	1
first	1
telegram	1
was	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
Stremov	1
s	1
appointment	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
post	1
Karenin	1
had	1
coveted	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
flung	1
the	1
telegram	1
down	1
and	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pace	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
Quos	1
vult	1
perdere	1
dementat	1
he	1
said	1
meaning	1
by	1
quos	1
the	1
persons	1
responsible	1
for	1
this	1
appointment	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
annoyed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
received	1
the	1
post	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
conspicuously	1
passed	1
over	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
incomprehensible	1
amazing	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
wordy	1
phrase	1
monger	1
Stremov	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
fit	1
for	1
it	1
How	1
could	1
they	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
ruining	1
themselves	1
lowering	1
their	1
prestige	1
by	1
this	1
appointment	1
Something	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
line	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
bitterly	1
opening	1
the	1
second	1
telegram	1
The	1
telegram	1
was	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
Her	1
name	1
written	1
in	1
blue	1
pencil	1
Anna	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
caught	1
his	1
eye	1
I	1
am	1
dying	1
I	1
beg	1
I	1
implore	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
easier	1
with	1
your	1
forgiveness	1
he	1
read	1
He	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
flung	1
down	1
the	1
telegram	1
That	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
trick	1
and	1
a	1
fraud	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
deceit	1
she	1
would	1
stick	1
at	1
She	1
was	1
near	1
her	1
confinement	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
confinement	1
But	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
their	1
aim	1
To	1
legitimize	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
compromise	1
me	1
and	1
prevent	1
a	1
divorce	1
he	1
thought	1
But	1
something	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
dying	1
He	1
read	1
the	1
telegram	1
again	1
and	1
suddenly	1
the	1
plain	1
meaning	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
agony	1
and	1
nearness	1
to	1
death	1
she	1
is	1
genuinely	1
penitent	1
and	1
I	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
trick	1
refuse	1
to	1
go	1
That	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
cruel	1
and	1
everyone	1
would	1
blame	1
me	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
stupid	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
Piotr	1
call	1
a	1
coach	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
If	1
her	1
illness	1
was	1
a	1
trick	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
nothing	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
again	1
If	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
danger	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
her	1
death	1
he	1
would	1
forgive	1
her	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
alive	1
and	1
pay	1
her	1
the	1
last	1
duties	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
too	1
late	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
With	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
uncleanness	1
from	1
the	1
night	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
fog	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
deserted	1
Nevsky	1
and	1
stared	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
awaiting	1
him	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
because	1
in	1
picturing	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
her	1
death	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
remove	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
Bakers	1
closed	1
shops	1
night	1
cabmen	1
porters	1
sweeping	1
the	1
pavements	1
flashed	1
past	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
watched	1
it	1
all	1
trying	1
to	1
smother	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
awaiting	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
hope	1
for	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
hoping	1
for	1
He	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
steps	1
A	1
sledge	1
and	1
a	1
carriage	1
with	1
the	1
coachman	1
asleep	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
entry	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
got	1
out	1
his	1
resolution	1
from	1
the	1
remotest	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
and	1
mastered	1
it	1
thoroughly	1
Its	1
meaning	1
ran	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
trick	1
then	1
calm	1
contempt	1
and	1
departure	1
If	1
truth	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
proper	1
The	1
porter	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
before	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
rang	1
The	1
porter	1
Kapitonitch	1
looked	1
queer	1
in	1
an	1
old	1
coat	1
without	1
a	1
tie	1
and	1
in	1
slippers	1
How	1
is	1
your	1
mistress	1
A	1
successful	1
confinement	1
yesterday	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
turned	1
white	1
He	1
felt	1
distinctly	1
now	1
how	1
intensely	1
he	1
had	1
longed	1
for	1
her	1
death	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
Korney	1
in	1
his	1
morning	1
apron	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
Very	1
ill	1
he	1
answered	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
consultation	1
yesterday	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
here	1
now	1
Take	1
my	1
things	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
feeling	1
some	1
relief	1
at	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
hope	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
On	1
the	1
hatstand	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
noticed	1
it	1
and	1
asked	1
Who	1
is	1
here	1
The	1
doctor	1
the	1
midwife	1
and	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1
In	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
steps	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
boudoir	1
the	1
midwife	1
in	1
a	1
cap	1
with	1
lilac	1
ribbons	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
towards	1
the	1
bedroom	1
Thank	1
God	1
you	1
ve	1
come	1
She	1
keeps	1
on	1
about	1
you	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
Make	1
haste	1
with	1
the	1
ice	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
peremptory	1
voice	1
said	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
boudoir	1
At	1
the	1
table	1
sitting	1
sideways	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
was	1
Vronsky	1
his	1
face	1
hidden	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
weeping	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
voice	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
saw	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Seeing	1
the	1
husband	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
overwhelmed	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
drawing	1
his	1
head	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
disappear	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
over	1
himself	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
She	1
is	1
dying	1
The	1
doctors	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
hope	1
I	1
am	1
entirely	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
only	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
here	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
disposal	1
I	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
seeing	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
tears	1
felt	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
that	1
nervous	1
emotion	1
always	1
produced	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
suffering	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
moved	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
hearing	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
From	1
the	1
bedroom	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
voice	1
saying	1
something	1
Her	1
voice	1
was	1
lively	1
eager	1
with	1
exceedingly	1
distinct	1
intonations	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
She	1
was	1
lying	1
turned	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
towards	1
him	1
Her	1
cheeks	1
were	1
flushed	1
crimson	1
her	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
her	1
little	1
white	1
hands	1
thrust	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown	1
were	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
quilt	1
twisting	1
it	1
about	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
well	1
and	1
blooming	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
She	1
was	1
talking	1
rapidly	1
musically	1
and	1
with	1
exceptionally	1
correct	1
articulation	1
and	1
expressive	1
intonation	1
For	1
Alexey	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
awful	1
thing	1
that	1
both	1
are	1
Alexey	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
Alexey	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
forget	1
he	1
would	1
forgive	1
But	1
why	1
doesn	1
t	1
he	1
come	1
He	1
s	1
so	1
good	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
know	1
himself	1
how	1
good	1
he	1
is	1
Ah	1
my	1
God	1
what	1
agony	1
Give	1
me	1
some	1
water	1
quick	1
Oh	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
bad	1
for	1
her	1
my	1
little	1
girl	1
Oh	1
very	1
well	1
then	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
nurse	1
Yes	1
I	1
agree	1
it	1
s	1
better	1
in	1
fact	1
He	1
ll	1
be	1
coming	1
it	1
will	1
hurt	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
Give	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
midwife	1
trying	1
to	1
attract	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Oh	1
what	1
nonsense	1
Anna	1
went	1
on	1
not	1
seeing	1
her	1
husband	1
No	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
little	1
one	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
come	1
yet	1
You	1
say	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
because	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
him	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
him	1
I	1
m	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
even	1
His	1
eyes	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
Seryozha	1
has	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
eyes	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
it	1
Has	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
his	1
dinner	1
I	1
know	1
everyone	1
will	1
forget	1
him	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
forget	1
Seryozha	1
must	1
be	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
corner	1
room	1
and	1
Mariette	1
must	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
sleep	1
with	1
him	1
All	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
she	1
shrank	1
back	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
in	1
terror	1
as	1
though	1
expecting	1
a	1
blow	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
defend	1
herself	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
husband	1
No	1
no	1
she	1
began	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
death	1
Alexey	1
come	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
because	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
time	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
long	1
left	1
to	1
live	1
the	1
fever	1
will	1
begin	1
directly	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
understand	1
nothing	1
more	1
Now	1
I	1
understand	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
wrinkled	1
face	1
wore	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
agony	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
utter	1
it	1
his	1
lower	1
lip	1
quivered	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
struggling	1
with	1
his	1
emotion	1
and	1
only	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
And	1
each	1
time	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
passionate	1
and	1
triumphant	1
tenderness	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
them	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
stay	1
She	1
stopped	1
as	1
though	1
collecting	1
her	1
ideas	1
Yes	1
she	1
began	1
yes	1
yes	1
yes	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
Don	1
t	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
woman	1
in	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
loved	1
that	1
man	1
and	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
hate	1
you	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
about	1
her	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
that	1
woman	1
Now	1
I	1
m	1
my	1
real	1
self	1
all	1
myself	1
I	1
m	1
dying	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
ask	1
him	1
Even	1
now	1
I	1
feel	1
see	1
here	1
the	1
weights	1
on	1
my	1
feet	1
on	1
my	1
hands	1
on	1
my	1
fingers	1
My	1
fingers	1
see	1
how	1
huge	1
they	1
are	1
But	1
this	1
will	1
soon	1
all	1
be	1
over	1
Only	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
want	1
forgive	1
me	1
forgive	1
me	1
quite	1
I	1
m	1
terrible	1
but	1
my	1
nurse	1
used	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
holy	1
martyr	1
what	1
was	1
her	1
name	1
She	1
was	1
worse	1
And	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
Rome	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
wilderness	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
trouble	1
to	1
anyone	1
only	1
I	1
ll	1
take	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
one	1
No	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
forgiven	1
No	1
no	1
go	1
away	1
you	1
re	1
too	1
good	1
She	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
one	1
burning	1
hand	1
while	1
she	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
The	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
kept	1
increasing	1
and	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	1
it	1
He	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
regarded	1
as	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
a	1
blissful	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
new	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
known	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Christian	1
law	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
trying	1
to	1
follow	1
enjoined	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
forgive	1
and	1
love	1
his	1
enemies	1
but	1
a	1
glad	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
his	1
enemies	1
filled	1
his	1
heart	1
He	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
laying	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
her	1
arm	1
which	1
burned	1
him	1
as	1
with	1
fire	1
through	1
the	1
sleeve	1
he	1
sobbed	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
arm	1
around	1
his	1
head	1
moved	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
defiant	1
pride	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
That	1
is	1
he	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
Now	1
forgive	1
me	1
everyone	1
forgive	1
me	1
They	1
ve	1
come	1
again	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
they	1
go	1
away	1
Oh	1
take	1
these	1
cloaks	1
off	1
me	1
The	1
doctor	1
unloosed	1
her	1
hands	1
carefully	1
laying	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
and	1
covered	1
her	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
shoulders	1
She	1
lay	1
back	1
submissively	1
and	1
looked	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
beaming	1
eyes	1
Remember	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
needed	1
nothing	1
but	1
forgiveness	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
more	1
Why	1
doesn	1
t	1
he	1
come	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
towards	1
Vronsky	1
Do	1
come	1
do	1
come	1
Give	1
him	1
your	1
hand	1
Vronsky	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
seeing	1
Anna	1
again	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
Uncover	1
your	1
face	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
saint	1
she	1
said	1
Oh	1
uncover	1
your	1
face	1
do	1
uncover	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
angrily	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
do	1
uncover	1
his	1
face	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
hands	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
awful	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
agony	1
and	1
shame	1
upon	1
it	1
Give	1
him	1
your	1
hand	1
Forgive	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
hand	1
not	1
attempting	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
streamed	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
Thank	1
God	1
thank	1
God	1
she	1
said	1
now	1
everything	1
is	1
ready	1
Only	1
to	1
stretch	1
my	1
legs	1
a	1
little	1
There	1
that	1
s	1
capital	1
How	1
badly	1
these	1
flowers	1
are	1
done	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
like	1
a	1
violet	1
she	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
hangings	1
My	1
God	1
my	1
God	1
when	1
will	1
it	1
end	1
Give	1
me	1
some	1
morphine	1
Doctor	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
morphine	1
Oh	1
my	1
God	1
my	1
God	1
And	1
she	1
tossed	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
The	1
doctors	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
puerperal	1
fever	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ninety	1
nine	1
chances	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
it	1
would	1
end	1
in	1
death	1
The	1
whole	1
day	1
long	1
there	1
was	1
fever	1
delirium	1
and	1
unconsciousness	1
At	1
midnight	1
the	1
patient	1
lay	1
without	1
consciousness	1
and	1
almost	1
without	1
pulse	1
The	1
end	1
was	1
expected	1
every	1
minute	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
gone	1
home	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
inquire	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
meeting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
said	1
Better	1
stay	1
she	1
might	1
ask	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
himself	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
boudoir	1
Towards	1
morning	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
return	1
again	1
of	1
excitement	1
rapid	1
thought	1
and	1
talk	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
unconsciousness	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
and	1
the	1
doctors	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
hope	1
That	1
day	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
boudoir	1
where	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
sitting	1
and	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
sat	1
down	1
opposite	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
feeling	1
that	1
a	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
coming	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
speak	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
Spare	1
me	1
However	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
believe	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
terrible	1
for	1
me	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
risen	1
but	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
out	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
I	1
must	1
explain	1
my	1
feelings	1
the	1
feelings	1
that	1
have	1
guided	1
me	1
and	1
will	1
guide	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
error	1
regarding	1
me	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
had	1
resolved	1
on	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
proceedings	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
conceal	1
from	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
beginning	1
this	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
misery	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
pursued	1
by	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
revenge	1
myself	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
When	1
I	1
got	1
the	1
telegram	1
I	1
came	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
more	1
I	1
longed	1
for	1
her	1
death	1
But	1
He	1
paused	1
pondering	1
whether	1
to	1
disclose	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
disclose	1
his	1
feeling	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
and	1
forgave	1
her	1
And	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
has	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
duty	1
I	1
forgive	1
completely	1
I	1
would	1
offer	1
the	1
other	1
cheek	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
cloak	1
if	1
my	1
coat	1
be	1
taken	1
I	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
bliss	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
Tears	1
stood	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
luminous	1
serene	1
look	1
in	1
them	1
impressed	1
Vronsky	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
position	1
you	1
can	1
trample	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
make	1
me	1
the	1
laughing	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
abandon	1
her	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
reproach	1
to	1
you	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
on	1
My	1
duty	1
is	1
clearly	1
marked	1
for	1
me	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
If	1
she	1
wishes	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
sobs	1
cut	1
short	1
his	1
words	1
Vronsky	1
too	1
was	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
stooping	1
not	1
yet	1
erect	1
posture	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
feeling	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
higher	1
and	1
even	1
unattainable	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
life	1
Chapter	1
18	1
After	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
Karenins	1
house	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
with	1
difficulty	1
remembering	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
walk	1
or	1
drive	1
He	1
felt	1
disgraced	1
humiliated	1
guilty	1
and	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
possibility	1
of	1
washing	1
away	1
his	1
humiliation	1
He	1
felt	1
thrust	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
beaten	1
track	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
proudly	1
and	1
lightly	1
walked	1
till	1
then	1
All	1
the	1
habits	1
and	1
rules	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
firm	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
suddenly	1
false	1
and	1
inapplicable	1
The	1
betrayed	1
husband	1
who	1
had	1
figured	1
till	1
that	1
time	1
as	1
a	1
pitiful	1
creature	1
an	1
incidental	1
and	1
somewhat	1
ludicrous	1
obstacle	1
to	1
his	1
happiness	1
had	1
suddenly	1
been	1
summoned	1
by	1
her	1
herself	1
elevated	1
to	1
an	1
awe	1
inspiring	1
pinnacle	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
pinnacle	1
that	1
husband	1
had	1
shown	1
himself	1
not	1
malignant	1
not	1
false	1
not	1
ludicrous	1
but	1
kind	1
and	1
straightforward	1
and	1
large	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
parts	1
were	1
suddenly	1
reversed	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
his	1
elevation	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
abasement	1
his	1
truth	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
falsehood	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
husband	1
was	1
magnanimous	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
sorrow	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
base	1
and	1
petty	1
in	1
his	1
deceit	1
But	1
this	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
humiliation	1
before	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
unjustly	1
despised	1
made	1
up	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
misery	1
He	1
felt	1
unutterably	1
wretched	1
now	1
for	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
Anna	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
late	1
to	1
be	1
growing	1
cooler	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
forever	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
all	1
of	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
illness	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
very	1
soul	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
loved	1
her	1
till	1
then	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
loved	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
humiliated	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
forever	1
leaving	1
with	1
her	1
nothing	1
of	1
himself	1
but	1
a	1
shameful	1
memory	1
Most	1
terrible	1
of	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
ludicrous	1
shameful	1
position	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
pulled	1
his	1
hands	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
humiliated	1
face	1
He	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
Karenins	1
house	1
like	1
one	1
distraught	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
A	1
sledge	1
sir	1
asked	1
the	1
porter	1
Yes	1
a	1
sledge	1
On	1
getting	1
home	1
after	1
three	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
Vronsky	1
without	1
undressing	1
lay	1
down	1
flat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
clasping	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
laying	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
them	1
His	1
head	1
was	1
heavy	1
Images	1
memories	1
and	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
strangest	1
description	1
followed	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
rapidity	1
and	1
vividness	1
First	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
medicine	1
he	1
had	1
poured	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
patient	1
and	1
spilt	1
over	1
the	1
spoon	1
then	1
the	1
midwife	1
s	1
white	1
hands	1
then	1
the	1
queer	1
posture	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
beside	1
the	1
bed	1
To	1
sleep	1
To	1
forget	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
serene	1
confidence	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
man	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
tired	1
and	1
sleepy	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
once	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
his	1
head	1
did	1
begin	1
to	1
feel	1
drowsy	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
drop	1
off	1
into	1
forgetfulness	1
The	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
unconsciousness	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
meet	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
violent	1
shock	1
of	1
electricity	1
had	1
passed	1
over	1
him	1
He	1
started	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
leaped	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
arms	1
got	1
in	1
a	1
panic	1
onto	1
his	1
knees	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
wide	1
open	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
asleep	1
The	1
heaviness	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
weariness	1
in	1
his	1
limbs	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
had	1
suddenly	1
gone	1
You	1
may	1
trample	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
he	1
heard	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
words	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
standing	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
burning	1
flush	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
tenderness	1
not	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
foolish	1
and	1
ludicrous	1
figure	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
again	1
and	1
flung	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
To	1
sleep	1
To	1
forget	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
But	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
distinctly	1
than	1
ever	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
memorable	1
evening	1
before	1
the	1
races	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
and	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
wipe	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
memory	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
live	1
without	1
it	1
How	1
can	1
we	1
be	1
reconciled	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
be	1
reconciled	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
began	1
to	1
repeat	1
these	1
words	1
This	1
repetition	1
checked	1
the	1
rising	1
up	1
of	1
fresh	1
images	1
and	1
memories	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
were	1
thronging	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
But	1
repeating	1
words	1
did	1
not	1
check	1
his	1
imagination	1
for	1
long	1
Again	1
in	1
extraordinarily	1
rapid	1
succession	1
his	1
best	1
moments	1
rose	1
before	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
recent	1
humiliation	1
Take	1
away	1
his	1
hands	1
Anna	1
s	1
voice	1
says	1
He	1
takes	1
away	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
feels	1
the	1
shamestruck	1
and	1
idiotic	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
He	1
still	1
lay	1
down	1
trying	1
to	1
sleep	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
hope	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
kept	1
repeating	1
stray	1
words	1
from	1
some	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
trying	1
by	1
this	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
rising	1
flood	1
of	1
fresh	1
images	1
He	1
listened	1
and	1
heard	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
mad	1
whisper	1
words	1
repeated	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
appreciate	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
enough	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
appreciate	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
enough	1
of	1
it	1
What	1
s	1
this	1
Am	1
I	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
Perhaps	1
What	1
makes	1
men	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
minds	1
what	1
makes	1
men	1
shoot	1
themselves	1
he	1
answered	1
himself	1
and	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
saw	1
with	1
wonder	1
an	1
embroidered	1
cushion	1
beside	1
him	1
worked	1
by	1
Varya	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
He	1
touched	1
the	1
tassel	1
of	1
the	1
cushion	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
Varya	1
of	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
last	1
But	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
extraneous	1
was	1
an	1
agonizing	1
effort	1
No	1
I	1
must	1
sleep	1
He	1
moved	1
the	1
cushion	1
up	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
head	1
into	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
for	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
I	1
must	1
think	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
What	1
is	1
left	1
His	1
mind	1
rapidly	1
ran	1
through	1
his	1
life	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
of	1
Anna	1
Ambition	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
Society	1
The	1
court	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
pause	1
anywhere	1
All	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
had	1
meaning	1
before	1
but	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reality	1
in	1
it	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
undid	1
his	1
belt	1
and	1
uncovering	1
his	1
hairy	1
chest	1
to	1
breathe	1
more	1
freely	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
This	1
is	1
how	1
people	1
go	1
mad	1
he	1
repeated	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
shoot	1
themselves	1
to	1
escape	1
humiliation	1
he	1
added	1
slowly	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
closed	1
it	1
then	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
and	1
clenched	1
teeth	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
took	1
a	1
revolver	1
looked	1
round	1
him	1
turned	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
loaded	1
barrel	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
thought	1
For	1
two	1
minutes	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
forward	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
intense	1
effort	1
of	1
thought	1
he	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
motionless	1
thinking	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
logical	1
continuous	1
and	1
clear	1
chain	1
of	1
reasoning	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
indubitable	1
conclusion	1
In	1
reality	1
this	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
seemed	1
convincing	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
simply	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
circle	1
of	1
memories	1
and	1
images	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
ten	1
times	1
already	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
memories	1
of	1
happiness	1
lost	1
forever	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
senselessness	1
of	1
everything	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
life	1
the	1
same	1
consciousness	1
of	1
humiliation	1
Even	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
these	1
images	1
and	1
emotions	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
repeated	1
when	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
his	1
thought	1
passed	1
again	1
round	1
the	1
same	1
spellbound	1
circle	1
of	1
memories	1
and	1
images	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1
revolver	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
clutching	1
it	1
vigorously	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
hand	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
squeezing	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
fist	1
he	1
pulled	1
the	1
trigger	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
but	1
a	1
violent	1
blow	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
sent	1
him	1
reeling	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
clutch	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
dropped	1
the	1
revolver	1
staggered	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
in	1
astonishment	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
his	1
room	1
looking	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
the	1
bent	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
wastepaper	1
basket	1
and	1
the	1
tiger	1
skin	1
rug	1
The	1
hurried	1
creaking	1
steps	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
coming	1
through	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
He	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
at	1
thought	1
and	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
seeing	1
blood	1
on	1
the	1
tiger	1
skin	1
rug	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
himself	1
Idiotic	1
Missed	1
he	1
said	1
fumbling	1
after	1
the	1
revolver	1
The	1
revolver	1
was	1
close	1
beside	1
him	1
he	1
sought	1
further	1
off	1
Still	1
feeling	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
not	1
being	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
balance	1
fell	1
over	1
streaming	1
with	1
blood	1
The	1
elegant	1
whiskered	1
manservant	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
continually	1
complaining	1
to	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
of	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
his	1
nerves	1
was	1
so	1
panic	1
stricken	1
on	1
seeing	1
his	1
master	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
him	1
losing	1
blood	1
while	1
he	1
ran	1
for	1
assistance	1
An	1
hour	1
later	1
Varya	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
three	1
doctors	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
and	1
who	1
all	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
she	1
got	1
the	1
wounded	1
man	1
to	1

Chapter	1
19	1
The	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
in	1
that	1
when	1
preparing	1
for	1
seeing	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
overlooked	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
her	1
repentance	1
might	1
be	1
sincere	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
forgive	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
die	1
this	1
mistake	1
was	1
two	1
months	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
Moscow	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
significance	1
But	1
the	1
mistake	1
made	1
by	1
him	1
had	1
arisen	1
not	1
simply	1
from	1
his	1
having	1
overlooked	1
that	1
contingency	1
but	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
his	1
own	1
heart	1
At	1
his	1
sick	1
wife	1
s	1
bedside	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
sympathetic	1
suffering	1
always	1
roused	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
others	1
and	1
hitherto	1
looked	1
on	1
by	1
him	1
with	1
shame	1
as	1
a	1
harmful	1
weakness	1
And	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
remorse	1
for	1
having	1
desired	1
her	1
death	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
made	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
conscious	1
not	1
simply	1
of	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
sufferings	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
spiritual	1
peace	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
experienced	1
before	1
He	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
his	1
spiritual	1
joy	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
seemed	1
insoluble	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
judging	1
blaming	1
and	1
hating	1
had	1
become	1
clear	1
and	1
simple	1
when	1
he	1
forgave	1
and	1
loved	1
He	1
forgave	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
pitied	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
her	1
remorse	1
He	1
forgave	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
pitied	1
him	1
especially	1
after	1
reports	1
reached	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
despairing	1
action	1
He	1
felt	1
more	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
than	1
before	1
And	1
he	1
blamed	1
himself	1
now	1
for	1
having	1
taken	1
too	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
newborn	1
baby	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
quite	1
peculiar	1
sentiment	1
not	1
of	1
pity	1
only	1
but	1
of	1
tenderness	1
At	1
first	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
compassion	1
alone	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
delicate	1
little	1
creature	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
child	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
cast	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
during	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
died	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
troubled	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
observe	1
how	1
fond	1
he	1
became	1
of	1
her	1
He	1
would	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
several	1
times	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
sit	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
nurses	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
got	1
quite	1
used	1
to	1
his	1
presence	1
Sometimes	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
a	1
stretch	1
he	1
would	1
sit	1
silently	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
saffron	1
red	1
downy	1
wrinkled	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
baby	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
frowning	1
brows	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
little	1
hands	1
with	1
clenched	1
fingers	1
that	1
rubbed	1
the	1
little	1
eyes	1
and	1
nose	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
particularly	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
perfect	1
peace	1
and	1
inward	1
harmony	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
nothing	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
But	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
distinctly	1
that	1
however	1
natural	1
the	1
position	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
long	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
it	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
besides	1
the	1
blessed	1
spiritual	1
force	1
controlling	1
his	1
soul	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
a	1
brutal	1
force	1
as	1
powerful	1
or	1
more	1
powerful	1
which	1
controlled	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
force	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
that	1
humble	1
peace	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
inquiring	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
Above	1
all	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
instability	1
and	1
unnaturalness	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
When	1
the	1
softening	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
near	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
began	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
him	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
wanting	1
and	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
something	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
foreseeing	1
their	1
present	1
relations	1
could	1
not	1
continue	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
expecting	1
something	1
from	1
him	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
February	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
Anna	1
s	1
baby	1
daughter	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
named	1
Anna	1
too	1
fell	1
ill	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
leaving	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
office	1
On	1
finishing	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
returned	1
home	1
at	1
four	1
Going	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
handsome	1
groom	1
in	1
a	1
braided	1
livery	1
and	1
a	1
bear	1
fur	1
cape	1
holding	1
a	1
white	1
fur	1
cloak	1
Who	1
is	1
here	1
asked	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Princess	1
Elizaveta	1
Federovna	1
Tverskaya	1
the	1
groom	1
answered	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
that	1
he	1
grinned	1
During	1
all	1
this	1
difficult	1
time	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
worldly	1
acquaintances	1
especially	1
women	1
took	1
a	1
peculiar	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
All	1
these	1
acquaintances	1
he	1
observed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
concealing	1
their	1
mirth	1
at	1
something	1
the	1
same	1
mirth	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
perceived	1
in	1
the	1
lawyer	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
just	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
this	1
groom	1
Everyone	1
seemed	1
somehow	1
hugely	1
delighted	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
at	1
a	1
wedding	1
When	1
they	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
ill	1
disguised	1
enjoyment	1
they	1
inquired	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
health	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
from	1
the	1
memories	1
associated	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
also	1
because	1
he	1
disliked	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
nursery	1
Seryozha	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
was	1
drawing	1
and	1
chatting	1
away	1
merrily	1
The	1
English	1
governess	1
who	1
had	1
during	1
Anna	1
s	1
illness	1
replaced	1
the	1
French	1
one	1
was	1
sitting	1
near	1
the	1
boy	1
knitting	1
a	1
shawl	1
She	1
hurriedly	1
got	1
up	1
curtseyed	1
and	1
pulled	1
Seryozha	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stroked	1
his	1
son	1
s	1
hair	1
answered	1
the	1
governess	1
s	1
inquiries	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
The	1
doctor	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
serious	1
and	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
bath	1
sir	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
pain	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
screaming	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
sir	1
the	1
Englishwoman	1
said	1
firmly	1
What	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
he	1
asked	1
stopping	1
short	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Countess	1
Paul	1
s	1
sir	1
They	1
gave	1
the	1
baby	1
medicine	1
and	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
simply	1
hungry	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
no	1
milk	1
sir	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
pondered	1
and	1
after	1
standing	1
still	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
The	1
baby	1
was	1
lying	1
with	1
its	1
head	1
thrown	1
back	1
stiffening	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
nurse	1
s	1
arms	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
plump	1
breast	1
offered	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
never	1
ceased	1
screaming	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
double	1
hushing	1
of	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
nurse	1
who	1
was	1
bending	1
over	1
her	1
Still	1
no	1
better	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
She	1
s	1
very	1
restless	1
answered	1
the	1
nurse	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
Miss	1
Edwarde	1
says	1
that	1
perhaps	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
has	1
no	1
milk	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
think	1
so	1
too	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Then	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
Who	1
s	1
one	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
still	1
ill	1
said	1
the	1
nurse	1
discontentedly	1
The	1
nurse	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
simple	1
words	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
an	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
position	1
The	1
baby	1
screamed	1
louder	1
than	1
ever	1
struggling	1
and	1
sobbing	1
The	1
nurse	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair	1
went	1
to	1
it	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
s	1
arms	1
and	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
rocking	1
it	1
You	1
must	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
The	1
smartly	1
dressed	1
and	1
healthy	1
looking	1
nurse	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
losing	1
her	1
place	1
muttered	1
something	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
covering	1
her	1
bosom	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
doubts	1
being	1
cast	1
on	1
her	1
abundance	1
of	1
milk	1
In	1
that	1
smile	1
too	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
saw	1
a	1
sneer	1
at	1
his	1
position	1
Luckless	1
child	1
said	1
the	1
nurse	1
hushing	1
the	1
baby	1
and	1
still	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
despondent	1
and	1
suffering	1
face	1
watched	1
the	1
nurse	1
walking	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
When	1
the	1
child	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
bed	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
after	1
smoothing	1
the	1
little	1
pillow	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walking	1
awkwardly	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
approached	1
the	1
baby	1
For	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
despondent	1
face	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
moved	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
forehead	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
as	1
softly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
In	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
he	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
send	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
He	1
felt	1
vexed	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
anxious	1
about	1
this	1
exquisite	1
baby	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
vexed	1
humor	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
either	1
to	1
see	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
But	1
his	1
wife	1
might	1
wonder	1
why	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
so	1
overcoming	1
his	1
disinclination	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
bedroom	1
As	1
he	1
walked	1
over	1
the	1
soft	1
rug	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
overhearing	1
a	1
conversation	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
If	1
he	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
going	1
away	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
understood	1
your	1
answer	1
and	1
his	1
too	1
But	1
your	1
husband	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
above	1
that	1
Betsy	1
was	1
saying	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
husband	1
for	1
myself	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
wish	1
it	1
Don	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
answered	1
Anna	1
s	1
excited	1
voice	1
Yes	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
care	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
shot	1
himself	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
With	1
a	1
dismayed	1
and	1
guilty	1
expression	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stopped	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
back	1
unobserved	1
But	1
reflecting	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
undignified	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
The	1
voices	1
were	1
silent	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
Anna	1
in	1
a	1
gray	1
dressing	1
gown	1
with	1
a	1
crop	1
of	1
short	1
clustering	1
black	1
curls	1
on	1
her	1
round	1
head	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
settee	1
The	1
eagerness	1
died	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
always	1
did	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
she	1
dropped	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
uneasily	1
at	1
Betsy	1
Betsy	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion	1
in	1
a	1
hat	1
that	1
towered	1
somewhere	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
shade	1
on	1
a	1
lamp	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
dress	1
with	1
violet	1
crossway	1
stripes	1
slanting	1
one	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
bodice	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
skirt	1
was	1
sitting	1
beside	1
Anna	1
her	1
tall	1
flat	1
figure	1
held	1
erect	1
Bowing	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
greeted	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile	1
Ah	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
though	1
surprised	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
re	1
at	1
home	1
You	1
never	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
anywhere	1
and	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
seen	1
you	1
ever	1
since	1
Anna	1
has	1
been	1
ill	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
your	1
anxiety	1
Yes	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
wonderful	1
husband	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
meaning	1
and	1
affable	1
air	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
bestowing	1
an	1
order	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
conduct	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
bowed	1
frigidly	1
and	1
kissing	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
asked	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
Better	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
avoiding	1
his	1
eyes	1
But	1
you	1
ve	1
rather	1
a	1
feverish	1
looking	1
color	1
he	1
said	1
laying	1
stress	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
feverish	1
We	1
ve	1
been	1
talking	1
too	1
much	1
said	1
Betsy	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
s	1
selfishness	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
but	1
Anna	1
suddenly	1
flushing	1
quickly	1
caught	1
at	1
her	1
hand	1
No	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
please	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
no	1
you	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
brow	1
were	1
suffused	1
with	1
crimson	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
keep	1
anything	1
secret	1
from	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
cracked	1
his	1
fingers	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
Betsy	1
s	1
been	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
wants	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
before	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
Tashkend	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
was	1
evidently	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
have	1
everything	1
out	1
however	1
hard	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
for	1
her	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
receive	1
him	1
You	1
said	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
depend	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Betsy	1
corrected	1
her	1
Oh	1
no	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
receive	1
him	1
and	1
what	1
object	1
would	1
there	1
She	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
In	1
short	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
wish	1
it	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
advanced	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
her	1
hand	1
Her	1
first	1
impulse	1
was	1
to	1
jerk	1
back	1
her	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
damp	1
hand	1
with	1
big	1
swollen	1
veins	1
that	1
sought	1
hers	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
obvious	1
effort	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
confidence	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
feeling	1
with	1
confusion	1
and	1
annoyance	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
decide	1
easily	1
and	1
clearly	1
by	1
himself	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
discuss	1
before	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
who	1
to	1
him	1
stood	1
for	1
the	1
incarnation	1
of	1
that	1
brute	1
force	1
which	1
would	1
inevitably	1
control	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
led	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
hinder	1
him	1
from	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
He	1
stopped	1
short	1
looking	1
at	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
Well	1
good	1
bye	1
my	1
darling	1
said	1
Betsy	1
getting	1
up	1
She	1
kissed	1
Anna	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
escorted	1
her	1
out	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
truly	1
magnanimous	1
man	1
said	1
Betsy	1
stopping	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
with	1
special	1
warmth	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
outsider	1
but	1
I	1
so	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
respect	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
advise	1
Receive	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Vronsky	1
is	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
to	1
Tashkend	1
Thank	1
you	1
princess	1
for	1
your	1
sympathy	1
and	1
advice	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
whether	1
my	1
wife	1
can	1
or	1
cannot	1
see	1
anyone	1
she	1
must	1
decide	1
herself	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
from	1
habit	1
lifting	1
his	1
brows	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
reflected	1
immediately	1
that	1
whatever	1
his	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
position	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
this	1
by	1
the	1
suppressed	1
malicious	1
and	1
ironical	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
Betsy	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
after	1
this	1
phrase	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
Betsy	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
She	1
was	1
lying	1
down	1
but	1
hearing	1
his	1
steps	1
she	1
sat	1
up	1
hastily	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
attitude	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
him	1
He	1
saw	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
your	1
confidence	1
in	1
me	1
He	1
repeated	1
gently	1
in	1
Russian	1
the	1
phrase	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
Betsy	1
s	1
presence	1
in	1
French	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
When	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
Russian	1
using	1
the	1
Russian	1
thou	1
of	1
intimacy	1
and	1
affection	1
it	1
was	1
insufferably	1
irritating	1
to	1
Anna	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
your	1
decision	1
I	1
too	1
imagine	1
that	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
for	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
However	1
if	1
But	1
I	1
ve	1
said	1
so	1
already	1
so	1
why	1
repeat	1
it	1
Anna	1
suddenly	1
interrupted	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
irritation	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
repressing	1
No	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
she	1
thought	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loves	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
ruin	1
himself	1
and	1
has	1
ruined	1
himself	1
and	1
who	1
cannot	1
live	1
without	1
him	1
No	1
sort	1
of	1
necessity	1
she	1
compressed	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
dropped	1
her	1
burning	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
swollen	1
veins	1
They	1
were	1
rubbing	1
each	1
other	1
Let	1
us	1
never	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
added	1
more	1
calmly	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
this	1
question	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
decide	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
beginning	1
That	1
my	1
wish	1
coincides	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
she	1
finished	1
quickly	1
exasperated	1
at	1
his	1
talking	1
so	1
slowly	1
while	1
she	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
all	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
Yes	1
he	1
assented	1
and	1
Princess	1
Tverskaya	1
s	1
interference	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
private	1
affairs	1
is	1
utterly	1
uncalled	1
for	1
She	1
especially	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
said	1
about	1
her	1
said	1
Anna	1
quickly	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
really	1
cares	1
for	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
She	1
played	1
nervously	1
with	1
the	1
tassel	1
of	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
that	1
torturing	1
sensation	1
of	1
physical	1
repulsion	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
blamed	1
herself	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
control	1
it	1
Her	1
only	1
desire	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
his	1
oppressive	1
presence	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
am	1

for	1
No	1
the	1
little	1
one	1
cries	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
nurse	1
hasn	1

milk	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
nurse	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
begged	1
to	1
Anyway	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
meant	1
by	1
that	1
anyway	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
baby	1
and	1
they	1
re	1
killing	1
her	1
She	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
baby	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
her	1
I	1
begged	1
to	1
nurse	1
her	1
I	1
wasn	1
t	1
allowed	1
to	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
blamed	1
for	1
it	1
I	1
don	1

Yes	1
you	1
do	1
blame	1
me	1
My	1
God	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
I	1
die	1
And	1
she	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs	1
Forgive	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
nervous	1
I	1
m	1
unjust	1
she	1
said	1
controlling	1
herself	1
but	1
do	1
go	1
away	1
No	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
decidedly	1
as	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
room	1
Never	1
had	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hatred	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
altogether	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
that	1
mysterious	1
brutal	1
force	1
that	1
guided	1
his	1
life	1
against	1
his	1
spiritual	1
inclinations	1
and	1
exacted	1
conformity	1
with	1
its	1
decrees	1
and	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
distinctness	1
as	1
that	1
day	1
He	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
something	1
but	1
what	1
exactly	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
rousing	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
destructive	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
his	1
achievement	1
He	1
believed	1
that	1
for	1
Anna	1
herself	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
break	1
off	1
all	1
relations	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
this	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
ready	1
to	1
allow	1
these	1
relations	1
to	1
be	1
renewed	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
not	1
disgraced	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
deprived	1
of	1
them	1
nor	1
forced	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
position	1
Bad	1
as	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
it	1
was	1
anyway	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
rupture	1
which	1
would	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
hopeless	1
and	1
shameful	1
position	1
and	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
everything	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
helpless	1
he	1
knew	1
beforehand	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
so	1
natural	1
and	1
right	1
but	1
would	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
proper	1
thing	1
to	1
them	1
Chapter	1
21	1
Before	1
Betsy	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
walk	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
by	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
Yeliseev	1
s	1
where	1
a	1
consignment	1
of	1
fresh	1
oysters	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
Ah	1
princess	1
what	1
a	1
delightful	1
meeting	1
he	1
began	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
A	1
meeting	1
for	1
one	1
minute	1
for	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
said	1
Betsy	1
smiling	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
her	1
glove	1
Don	1
t	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
glove	1
yet	1
princess	1
let	1
me	1
kiss	1
your	1
hand	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
thankful	1
to	1
the	1
revival	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
fashions	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
kissing	1
the	1
hand	1
He	1
kissed	1
Betsy	1
s	1
hand	1
When	1
shall	1
we	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
deserve	1
it	1
answered	1
Betsy	1
smiling	1
Oh	1
yes	1
I	1
deserve	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
for	1
I	1
ve	1
become	1
a	1
most	1
serious	1
person	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
only	1
manage	1
my	1
own	1
affairs	1
but	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
too	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
expression	1
Oh	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
answered	1
Betsy	1
at	1
once	1
understanding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
Anna	1
And	1
going	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
He	1
s	1
killing	1
her	1
said	1
Betsy	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
It	1
s	1
impossible	1
impossible	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
sympathetically	1
distressed	1
expression	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
for	1
The	1
whole	1
town	1
s	1
talking	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
It	1
s	1
an	1
impossible	1
position	1
She	1
pines	1
and	1
pines	1
away	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
women	1
who	1
can	1
t	1
trifle	1
with	1
their	1
feelings	1
One	1
of	1
two	1
things	1
either	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
her	1
away	1
act	1
with	1
energy	1
or	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
divorce	1
This	1
is	1
stifling	1
her	1
Yes	1
yes	1
just	1
so	1
Oblonsky	1
said	1
sighing	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
for	1
At	1
least	1
not	1
solely	1
for	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
Kammerherr	1
of	1
course	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
say	1
thank	1
you	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
was	1
having	1
to	1
settle	1
this	1
Well	1
God	1
help	1
you	1
said	1
Betsy	1
After	1
accompanying	1
Betsy	1
to	1
the	1
outside	1
hall	1
once	1
more	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
above	1
the	1
glove	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
pulse	1
beats	1
and	1
murmuring	1
to	1
her	1
such	1
unseemly	1
nonsense	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
to	1
laugh	1
or	1
be	1
angry	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
He	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
tears	1
Although	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
bubbling	1
over	1
with	1
good	1
spirits	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
immediately	1
and	1
quite	1
naturally	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
sympathetic	1
poetically	1
emotional	1
tone	1
which	1
harmonized	1
with	1
her	1
mood	1
He	1
asked	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
morning	1
Very	1
very	1
miserably	1
Today	1
and	1
this	1
morning	1
and	1
all	1
past	1
days	1
and	1
days	1
to	1
come	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
re	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
pessimism	1
You	1
must	1
rouse	1
yourself	1
you	1
must	1
look	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
hard	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
women	1
love	1
men	1
even	1
for	1
their	1
vices	1
Anna	1
began	1
suddenly	1
but	1
I	1
hate	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
virtues	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
has	1
a	1
physical	1
effect	1
on	1
me	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
beside	1
myself	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
unhappy	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
one	1
couldn	1
t	1
be	1
more	1
unhappy	1
but	1
the	1
awful	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
through	1
now	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
conceived	1
Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it	1
that	1
knowing	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
a	1
splendid	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
worth	1
his	1
little	1
finger	1
still	1
I	1
hate	1
him	1
I	1
hate	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
generosity	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
death	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
finish	1
You	1
are	1
ill	1
and	1
overwrought	1
he	1
said	1
believe	1
me	1
you	1
re	1
exaggerating	1
dreadfully	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
so	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
And	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiled	1
No	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
place	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
such	1
despair	1
would	1
have	1
ventured	1
to	1
smile	1
the	1
smile	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
brutal	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
smile	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
sweetness	1
and	1
almost	1
feminine	1
tenderness	1
that	1
his	1
smile	1
did	1
not	1
wound	1
but	1
softened	1
and	1
soothed	1
His	1
gentle	1
soothing	1
words	1
and	1
smiles	1
were	1
as	1
soothing	1
and	1
softening	1
as	1
almond	1
oil	1
And	1
Anna	1
soon	1
felt	1
this	1
No	1
Stiva	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
m	1
lost	1
lost	1
worse	1
than	1
lost	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
yet	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
over	1
I	1
m	1
an	1
overstrained	1
string	1
that	1
must	1
snap	1
But	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
ended	1
yet	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
fearful	1
end	1
No	1
matter	1
we	1
must	1
let	1
the	1
string	1
be	1
loosened	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
position	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
escape	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
and	1
thought	1
Only	1
one	1
Again	1
he	1
knew	1
from	1
her	1
terrified	1
eyes	1
that	1
this	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
escape	1
in	1
her	1
thought	1
was	1
death	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
say	1
it	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
Listen	1
to	1
me	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
your	1
own	1
position	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
Let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
candidly	1
my	1
opinion	1
Again	1
he	1
smiled	1
discreetly	1
his	1
almond	1
oil	1
smile	1
I	1
ll	1
begin	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
You	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
twenty	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
yourself	1
You	1
married	1
him	1
without	1
love	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
love	1
was	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
mistake	1
let	1
s	1
admit	1
A	1
fearful	1
mistake	1
said	1
Anna	1
But	1
I	1
repeat	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
accomplished	1
fact	1
Then	1
you	1
had	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
love	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
your	1
husband	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune	1
but	1
that	1
too	1
is	1
an	1
accomplished	1
fact	1
And	1
your	1
husband	1
knew	1
it	1
and	1
forgave	1
it	1
He	1
stopped	1
at	1
each	1
sentence	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
object	1
but	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
That	1
s	1
so	1
Now	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
can	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
with	1
your	1
husband	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
it	1
Does	1
he	1
wish	1
it	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
But	1
you	1
said	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
endure	1
him	1
No	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
I	1
deny	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
Yes	1
but	1
let	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
m	1
lying	1
head	1
downwards	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
pit	1
but	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
save	1
myself	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
Never	1
mind	1
we	1
ll	1
slip	1
something	1
under	1
and	1
pull	1
you	1
out	1
I	1
understand	1
you	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
yourself	1
to	1
express	1
your	1
wishes	1
your	1
feelings	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
I	1
wish	1
except	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
over	1
But	1
he	1
sees	1
this	1
and	1
knows	1
it	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
it	1
weighs	1
on	1
him	1
any	1
less	1
than	1
on	1
you	1
You	1
re	1
wretched	1
he	1
s	1
wretched	1
and	1
what	1
good	1
can	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
while	1
divorce	1
would	1
solve	1
the	1
difficulty	1
completely	1
With	1
some	1
effort	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
brought	1
out	1
his	1
central	1
idea	1
and	1
looked	1
significantly	1
at	1
her	1
She	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
cropped	1
head	1
in	1
dissent	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
suddenly	1
brightened	1
into	1
its	1
old	1
beauty	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
desire	1
this	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
unattainable	1
happiness	1
I	1
m	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
you	1
And	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
arrange	1
things	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
more	1
boldly	1
Don	1
t	1
speak	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
God	1
grant	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
as	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
him	1
Anna	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
dreamy	1
shining	1
eyes	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
Chapter	1

Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
somewhat	1
solemn	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
presidential	1
chair	1
at	1
his	1
board	1
walked	1
into	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
room	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
thinking	1
of	1
just	1
what	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
been	1
discussing	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
interrupting	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
on	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
becoming	1
suddenly	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
unusual	1
with	1
him	1
To	1
conceal	1
this	1
embarrassment	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
cigarette	1
case	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
bought	1
that	1
opened	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
way	1
and	1
sniffing	1
the	1
leather	1
took	1
a	1
cigarette	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
No	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
anything	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
asked	1
without	1
eagerness	1
Yes	1
I	1
wished	1
I	1
wanted	1
yes	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
surprise	1
aware	1
of	1
an	1
unaccustomed	1
timidity	1
This	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
unexpected	1
and	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
conscience	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
meaning	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
wrong	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
struggled	1
with	1
the	1
timidity	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
my	1
sister	1
and	1
my	1
sincere	1
affection	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
reddening	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
struck	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
by	1
its	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
unresisting	1
sacrifice	1
I	1
intended	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
about	1
my	1
sister	1
and	1
your	1
mutual	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
still	1
struggling	1
with	1
an	1
unaccustomed	1
constraint	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
mournfully	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
took	1
from	1
it	1
an	1
unfinished	1
letter	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
I	1
think	1
unceasingly	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
writing	1
thinking	1
I	1
could	1
say	1
it	1
better	1
by	1
letter	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
presence	1
irritates	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
letter	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
looked	1
with	1
incredulous	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
lusterless	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
so	1
immovably	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
my	1
presence	1
is	1
irksome	1
to	1
you	1
Painful	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
blame	1
you	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness	1
that	1
on	1
seeing	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
illness	1
I	1
resolved	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart	1
to	1
forget	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
new	1
life	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
regret	1
and	1
shall	1
never	1
regret	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
desired	1
one	1
thing	1
your	1
good	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
your	1
soul	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
attained	1
that	1
Tell	1
me	1
yourself	1
what	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
true	1
happiness	1
and	1
peace	1
to	1
your	1
soul	1
I	1
put	1
myself	1
entirely	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
and	1
trust	1
to	1
your	1
feeling	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
right	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
handed	1
back	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
surprise	1
continued	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
This	1
silence	1
was	1
so	1
awkward	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
lips	1
began	1
twitching	1
nervously	1
while	1
he	1
still	1
gazed	1
without	1
speaking	1
at	1
Karenin	1
s	1
face	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
turning	1
away	1
Yes	1
yes	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
were	1
choking	1
him	1
Yes	1
yes	1
I	1
understand	1
you	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
She	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
judge	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
recovering	1
himself	1
She	1
is	1
crushed	1
simply	1
crushed	1
by	1
your	1
generosity	1
If	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
saying	1
anything	1
she	1
would	1
only	1
hang	1
her	1
head	1
lower	1
than	1
ever	1
Yes	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
how	1
explain	1
how	1
find	1
out	1
her	1
wishes	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
opinion	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
lies	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
directly	1
the	1
steps	1
you	1
consider	1
necessary	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
position	1
So	1
you	1
consider	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
ended	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
interrupted	1
him	1
But	1
how	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
not	1
usual	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
possible	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
There	1
is	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
position	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
standing	1
up	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
cheerful	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
thought	1
of	1
breaking	1
off	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
convinced	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
make	1
each	1
other	1
happy	1
Happiness	1
may	1
be	1
variously	1
understood	1
But	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
agree	1
to	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
nothing	1
what	1
way	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
position	1
If	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
opinion	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
of	1
softening	1
almond	1
oil	1
tenderness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
Anna	1
His	1
kindly	1
smile	1
was	1
so	1
winning	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
feeling	1
his	1
own	1
weakness	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
swayed	1
by	1
it	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
what	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
saying	1
She	1
will	1
never	1
speak	1
out	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
possible	1
one	1
thing	1
she	1
might	1
desire	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
cessation	1
of	1
your	1
relations	1
and	1
all	1
memories	1
associated	1
with	1
them	1
To	1
my	1
thinking	1
in	1
your	1
position	1
what	1
s	1
essential	1
is	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
attitude	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
And	1
that	1
can	1
only	1
rest	1
on	1
a	1
basis	1
of	1
freedom	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
Divorce	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
interrupted	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
aversion	1
Yes	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
divorce	1
yes	1
divorce	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
repeated	1
reddening	1
That	1
is	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
the	1
most	1
rational	1
course	1
for	1
married	1
people	1
who	1
find	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
if	1
married	1
people	1
find	1
that	1
life	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
together	1
That	1
may	1
always	1
happen	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sighed	1
heavily	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
There	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
point	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
is	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
parties	1
desirous	1
of	1
forming	1
new	1
ties	1
If	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
simple	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
feeling	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
free	1
from	1
constraint	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
scowling	1
with	1
emotion	1
muttered	1
something	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
All	1
that	1
seemed	1
so	1
simple	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
thought	1
over	1
thousands	1
of	1
times	1
And	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
simple	1
it	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
Divorce	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
because	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
religion	1
forbade	1
his	1
taking	1
upon	1
himself	1
a	1
fictitious	1
charge	1
of	1
adultery	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
suffering	1
his	1
wife	1
pardoned	1
and	1
beloved	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
public	1
shame	1
Divorce	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
impossible	1
also	1
on	1
other	1
still	1
more	1
weighty	1
grounds	1
What	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
divorce	1
To	1
leave	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
The	1
divorced	1
mother	1
would	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
illegitimate	1
family	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
position	1
as	1
a	1
stepson	1
and	1
his	1
education	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
good	1
Keep	1
him	1
with	1
him	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
vengeance	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
But	1
apart	1
from	1
this	1
what	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
made	1
divorce	1
seem	1
impossible	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
that	1
by	1
consenting	1
to	1
a	1
divorce	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
completely	1
ruining	1
Anna	1
The	1
saying	1
of	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
at	1
Moscow	1
that	1
in	1
deciding	1
on	1
a	1
divorce	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
considering	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
ruining	1
her	1
irrevocably	1
had	1
sunk	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
And	1
connecting	1
this	1
saying	1
with	1
his	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
To	1
consent	1
to	1
a	1
divorce	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
her	1
freedom	1
meant	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
himself	1
the	1
last	1
tie	1
that	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
the	1
children	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
last	1
prop	1
that	1
stayed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
right	1
to	1
thrust	1
her	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
ruin	1
If	1
she	1
were	1
divorced	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
would	1
join	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
and	1
their	1
tie	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
and	1
criminal	1
one	1
since	1
a	1
wife	1
by	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
ecclesiastical	1
law	1
could	1
not	1
marry	1
while	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
living	1
She	1
will	1
join	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
he	1
will	1
throw	1
her	1
over	1
or	1
she	1
will	1
form	1
a	1
new	1
tie	1
thought	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
And	1
I	1
by	1
agreeing	1
to	1
an	1
unlawful	1
divorce	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
her	1
ruin	1
He	1
had	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1
and	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
a	1
divorce	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
simple	1
as	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
said	1
but	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
thousand	1
objections	1
to	1
make	1
but	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
mighty	1
brutal	1
force	1
which	1
controlled	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
submit	1
The	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
on	1
what	1
terms	1
you	1
agree	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
divorce	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
anything	1
does	1
not	1
dare	1
ask	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
she	1
leaves	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
your	1
generosity	1
My	1
God	1
my	1
God	1
what	1
for	1
thought	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
remembering	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
divorce	1
proceedings	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
husband	1
took	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
himself	1
and	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
gesture	1
with	1
which	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
for	1
shame	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
You	1
are	1
distressed	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
cheek	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
other	1
also	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
coat	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
thy	1
cloak	1
also	1
thought	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Yes	1
yes	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
shrill	1
voice	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
disgrace	1
on	1
myself	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
up	1
even	1
my	1
son	1
but	1
but	1
wouldn	1
t	1
it	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
alone	1
Still	1
you	1
may	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
And	1
turning	1
away	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
There	1
was	1
bitterness	1
there	1
was	1
shame	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
with	1
bitterness	1
and	1
shame	1
he	1
felt	1
joy	1
and	1
emotion	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
meekness	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
touched	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
believe	1
me	1
she	1
appreciates	1
your	1
generosity	1
he	1
said	1
But	1
it	1
seems	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
felt	1
how	1
foolish	1
a	1
remark	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressed	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
foolishness	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
some	1
reply	1
but	1
tears	1
stopped	1
him	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
unhappy	1
fatality	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
accept	1
it	1
as	1
such	1
I	1
accept	1
the	1
calamity	1
as	1
an	1
accomplished	1
fact	1
and	1
am	1
doing	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
help	1
both	1
her	1
and	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
s	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
touched	1
but	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
being	1
glad	1
he	1
had	1
successfully	1
brought	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
words	1
To	1
this	1
satisfaction	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
just	1
struck	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
riddle	1
turning	1
on	1
his	1
successful	1
achievement	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends	1
He	1
put	1
this	1
riddle	1
into	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
different	1
ways	1
But	1
I	1
ll	1
work	1
it	1
out	1
better	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Chapter	1
23	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
wound	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
dangerous	1
one	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
touch	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
Varya	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
Varya	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
I	1
shot	1
myself	1
by	1
accident	1
And	1
please	1
never	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
tell	1
everyone	1
so	1
Or	1
else	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
ridiculous	1
Without	1
answering	1
his	1
words	1
Varya	1
bent	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
delighted	1
smile	1
gazed	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
clear	1
not	1
feverish	1
but	1
their	1
expression	1
was	1
stern	1
Thank	1
God	1
she	1
said	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
in	1
pain	1
A	1
little	1
here	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
breast	1
Then	1
let	1
me	1
change	1
your	1
bandages	1
In	1
silence	1
stiffening	1
his	1
broad	1
jaws	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
while	1
she	1
bandaged	1
him	1
up	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
delirious	1
Please	1
manage	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
talk	1
of	1
my	1
having	1
shot	1
myself	1
on	1
purpose	1
No	1
one	1
does	1
say	1
so	1
Only	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
shoot	1
yourself	1
by	1
accident	1
any	1
more	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
smile	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
And	1
he	1
smiled	1
gloomily	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
this	1
smile	1
which	1
so	1
frightened	1
Varya	1
when	1
the	1
inflammation	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
recover	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
completely	1
free	1
from	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
misery	1
By	1
his	1
action	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
washed	1
away	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
humiliation	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
before	1
He	1
could	1
now	1
think	1
calmly	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
He	1
recognized	1
all	1
his	1
magnanimity	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
feel	1
himself	1
humiliated	1
by	1
it	1
Besides	1
he	1
got	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
beaten	1
track	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
looking	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
again	1
without	1
shame	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
live	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
habits	1
One	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
pluck	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
ceased	1
struggling	1
with	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
regret	1
amounting	1
to	1
despair	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
forever	1
That	1
now	1
having	1
expiated	1
his	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
husband	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
renounce	1
her	1
and	1
never	1
in	1
future	1
to	1
stand	1
between	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
repentance	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
had	1
firmly	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
his	1
regret	1
at	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
erase	1
from	1
his	1
memory	1
those	1
moments	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
prized	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
that	1
haunted	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
charm	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
had	1
planned	1
his	1
appointment	1
at	1
Tashkend	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
agreed	1
to	1
the	1
proposition	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
hesitation	1
But	1
the	1
nearer	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
departure	1
came	1
the	1
bitterer	1
was	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
duty	1
His	1
wound	1
had	1
healed	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
driving	1
about	1
making	1
preparations	1
for	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
Tashkend	1
To	1
see	1
her	1
once	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
bury	1
myself	1
to	1
die	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
paying	1
farewell	1
visits	1
he	1
uttered	1
this	1
thought	1
to	1
Betsy	1
Charged	1
with	1
this	1
commission	1
Betsy	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Anna	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
a	1
negative	1
reply	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
thought	1
Vronsky	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
news	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
weakness	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
shattered	1
what	1
strength	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
Next	1
day	1
Betsy	1
herself	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
through	1
Oblonsky	1
as	1
a	1
positive	1
fact	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
see	1
Anna	1
Without	1
even	1
troubling	1
himself	1
to	1
see	1
Betsy	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
flat	1
forgetting	1
all	1
his	1
resolutions	1
without	1
asking	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
where	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
Vronsky	1
drove	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
Karenins	1
He	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
seeing	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
nothing	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
step	1
almost	1
breaking	1
into	1
a	1
run	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
And	1
without	1
considering	1
without	1
noticing	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
or	1
not	1
he	1
flung	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cover	1
her	1
face	1
her	1
hands	1
her	1
neck	1
with	1
kisses	1
Anna	1
had	1
been	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
this	1
meeting	1
had	1
thought	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
saying	1
anything	1
of	1
it	1
his	1
passion	1
mastered	1
her	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
calm	1
him	1
to	1
calm	1
herself	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
His	1
feeling	1
infected	1
her	1
Her	1
lips	1
trembled	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
Yes	1
you	1
have	1
conquered	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
yours	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
pressing	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
So	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
said	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
live	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
now	1
That	1
s	1
true	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
whiter	1
and	1
whiter	1
and	1
embracing	1
his	1
head	1
Still	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
It	1
will	1
all	1
pass	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
pass	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
Our	1
love	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
stronger	1
will	1
be	1
strengthened	1
by	1
there	1
being	1
something	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
parting	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
smile	1
And	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
respond	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
stroked	1
her	1
chilled	1
cheeks	1
and	1
cropped	1
head	1
with	1
it	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
short	1
hair	1
You	1
ve	1
grown	1
so	1
pretty	1
A	1
boy	1
But	1
how	1
pale	1
you	1
are	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
weak	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
And	1
her	1
lips	1
began	1
trembling	1
again	1
We	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
Italy	1
you	1
will	1
get	1
strong	1
he	1
said	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
like	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
alone	1
your	1
family	1
with	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
close	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
It	1
only	1
seems	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
ever	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
Stiva	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
accept	1
his	1
generosity	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
dreamily	1
past	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
a	1
divorce	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
Only	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
decide	1
about	1
Seryozha	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
how	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
of	1
their	1
meeting	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
of	1
divorce	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
matter	1
Don	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
that	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
still	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
Oh	1
why	1
didn	1
t	1
I	1
die	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
silent	1
tears	1
flowed	1
down	1
both	1
her	1
cheeks	1
but	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
wound	1
him	1
To	1
decline	1
the	1
flattering	1
and	1
dangerous	1
appointment	1
at	1
Tashkend	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
till	1
then	1
considered	1
disgraceful	1
and	1
impossible	1
But	1
now	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
consideration	1
he	1
declined	1
it	1
and	1
observing	1
dissatisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
exalted	1
quarters	1
at	1
this	1
step	1
he	1
immediately	1
retired	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
A	1
month	1
later	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
while	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
gone	1
abroad	1
not	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
divorce	1
but	1
having	1
absolutely	1
declined	1
all	1
idea	1
of	1
one	1
PART	1
FIVE	1
Chapter	1
1	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
the	1
wedding	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
before	1
Lent	1
just	1
five	1
weeks	1
off	1
since	1
not	1
half	1
the	1
trousseau	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
ready	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
agree	1
with	1
Levin	1
that	1
to	1
fix	1
it	1
for	1
after	1
Lent	1
would	1
be	1
putting	1
it	1
off	1
too	1
late	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
aunt	1
of	1
Prince	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
s	1
was	1
seriously	1
ill	1
and	1
might	1
die	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
mourning	1
would	1
delay	1
the	1
wedding	1
still	1
longer	1
And	1
therefore	1
deciding	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
trousseau	1
into	1
two	1
parts	1
a	1
larger	1
and	1
smaller	1
trousseau	1
the	1
princess	1
consented	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
wedding	1
before	1
Lent	1
She	1
determined	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
get	1
the	1
smaller	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
trousseau	1
all	1
ready	1
now	1
and	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
later	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
vexed	1
with	1
Levin	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
a	1
serious	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
this	1
arrangement	1
or	1
not	1
The	1
arrangement	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
suitable	1
as	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
trousseau	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wanted	1
Levin	1
still	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
delirious	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
happiness	1
constituted	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
sole	1
aim	1
of	1
all	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
now	1
think	1
or	1
care	1
about	1
anything	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
others	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
plans	1
and	1
aims	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
he	1
left	1
its	1
arrangement	1
to	1
others	1
knowing	1
that	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
delightful	1
His	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
guided	1
him	1
in	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
All	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
agree	1
entirely	1
with	1
everything	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
His	1
brother	1
raised	1
money	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
princess	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
abroad	1
He	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything	1
Do	1
what	1
you	1
choose	1
if	1
it	1
amuses	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
happy	1
and	1
my	1
happiness	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
greater	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
for	1
anything	1
you	1
do	1
he	1
thought	1
When	1
he	1
told	1
Kitty	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
advice	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
abroad	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
surprised	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
this	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
definite	1
requirements	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
future	1
She	1
knew	1
Levin	1
had	1
work	1
he	1
loved	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
understand	1
this	1
work	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
care	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
But	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
regarding	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
And	1
then	1
she	1
knew	1
their	1
home	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
not	1
abroad	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
their	1
home	1
would	1
be	1
This	1
definitely	1
expressed	1
purpose	1
astonished	1
Levin	1
But	1
since	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
either	1
way	1
he	1
immediately	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
to	1
arrange	1
everything	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
ability	1
with	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
day	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
everything	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
s	1
arrival	1
have	1
you	1
a	1
certificate	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
confession	1
No	1
But	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
married	1
without	1
it	1
A"ie	1
a"ie	1
a"ie	1
	1
cried	1
Levin	1
Why	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
nine	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
ve	1
taken	1
the	1
sacrament	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
You	1
re	1
a	1
pretty	1
fellow	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
and	1
you	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
Nihilist	1
But	1
this	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
You	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
sacrament	1
When	1
There	1
are	1
four	1
days	1
left	1
now	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
arranged	1
this	1
also	1
and	1
Levin	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
confession	1
To	1
Levin	1
as	1
to	1
any	1
unbeliever	1
who	1
respects	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
church	1
ceremonies	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
softened	1
state	1
of	1
feeling	1
sensitive	1
to	1
everything	1
this	1
inevitable	1
act	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
painful	1
to	1
Levin	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
heyday	1
of	1
his	1
highest	1
glory	1
his	1
fullest	1
flower	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
liar	1
or	1
a	1
scoffer	1
He	1
felt	1
incapable	1
of	1
being	1
either	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
plied	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
obtaining	1
a	1
certificate	1
without	1
actually	1
communicating	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
maintained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
Besides	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
two	1
days	1
And	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
awfully	1
nice	1
clever	1
old	1
fellow	1
He	1
ll	1
pull	1
the	1
tooth	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
so	1
gently	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
notice	1
it	1
Standing	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
litany	1
Levin	1
attempted	1
to	1
revive	1
in	1
himself	1
his	1
youthful	1
recollections	1
of	1
the	1
intense	1
religious	1
emotion	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
between	1
the	1
ages	1
of	1
sixteen	1
and	1
seventeen	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
attempted	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
an	1
empty	1
custom	1
having	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
meaning	1
like	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
paying	1
calls	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
that	1
either	1
Levin	1
found	1
himself	1
like	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
his	1
contemporaries	1
in	1
the	1
vaguest	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
religion	1
Believe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
firm	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
wrong	1
And	1
consequently	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
nor	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
with	1
indifference	1
as	1
an	1
empty	1
formality	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
of	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
sacrament	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
discomfort	1
and	1
shame	1
at	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
understand	1
and	1
what	1
as	1
an	1
inner	1
voice	1
told	1
him	1
was	1
therefore	1
false	1
and	1
wrong	1
During	1
the	1
service	1
he	1
would	1
first	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
trying	1
to	1
attach	1
some	1
meaning	1
to	1
them	1
not	1
discordant	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
views	1
then	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
must	1
condemn	1
them	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
thoughts	1
observations	1
and	1
memories	1
which	1
floated	1
through	1
his	1
brain	1
with	1
extreme	1
vividness	1
during	1
this	1
idle	1
time	1
of	1
standing	1
in	1
church	1
He	1
had	1
stood	1
through	1
the	1
litany	1
the	1
evening	1
service	1
and	1
the	1
midnight	1
service	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
tea	1
went	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
service	1
and	1
the	1
confession	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
a	1
beggar	1
soldier	1
two	1
old	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
officials	1
A	1
young	1
deacon	1
whose	1
long	1
back	1
showed	1
in	1
two	1
distinct	1
halves	1
through	1
his	1
thin	1
undercassock	1
met	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
at	1
the	1
wall	1
read	1
the	1
exhortation	1
During	1
the	1
reading	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
frequent	1
and	1
rapid	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
which	1
resounded	1
with	1
an	1
echo	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
thought	1
was	1
shut	1
and	1
sealed	1
up	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
touched	1
or	1
stirred	1
now	1
or	1
confusion	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
and	1
so	1
standing	1
behind	1
the	1
deacon	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
neither	1
listening	1
nor	1
examining	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
It	1
s	1
wonderful	1
what	1
expression	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
thought	1
remembering	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
table	1
They	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
as	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
kept	1
opening	1
and	1
shutting	1
it	1
and	1
laughed	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
action	1
He	1
remembered	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
examined	1
the	1
lines	1
on	1
the	1
pink	1
palm	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
again	1
thought	1
Levin	1
crossing	1
himself	1
bowing	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
supple	1
spring	1
of	1
the	1
deacon	1
s	1
back	1
bowing	1
before	1
him	1
She	1
took	1
my	1
hand	1
then	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
lines	1
You	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
splendid	1
hand	1
she	1
said	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
deacon	1
Yes	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
over	1
he	1
thought	1
No	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
beginning	1
again	1
he	1
thought	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
ending	1
there	1
he	1
is	1
bowing	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
That	1
s	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
The	1
deacon	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
plush	1
cuff	1
accepted	1
a	1
three	1
rouble	1
note	1
unobtrusively	1
and	1
the	1
deacon	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
register	1
and	1
his	1
new	1
boots	1
creaking	1
jauntily	1
over	1
the	1
flagstones	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
church	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
A	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
peeped	1
out	1
thence	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Levin	1
Thought	1
till	1
then	1
locked	1
up	1
began	1
to	1
stir	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
head	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
away	1
It	1
will	1
come	1
right	1
somehow	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
altar	1
rails	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
saw	1
the	1
priest	1
The	1
priest	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
scanty	1
grizzled	1
beard	1
and	1
weary	1
good	1
natured	1
eyes	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
rails	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
a	1
missal	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
to	1
Levin	1
he	1
began	1
immediately	1
reading	1
prayers	1
in	1
the	1
official	1
voice	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
them	1
he	1
bowed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
turned	1
facing	1
Levin	1
Christ	1
is	1
present	1
here	1
unseen	1
receiving	1
your	1
confession	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
crucifix	1
Do	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
doctrines	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Apostolic	1
Church	1
the	1
priest	1
went	1
on	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
away	1
from	1
Levin	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
folding	1
his	1
hands	1
under	1
his	1
stole	1
I	1
have	1
doubted	1
I	1
doubt	1
everything	1
said	1
Levin	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
jarred	1
on	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
The	1
priest	1
waited	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
and	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
said	1
quickly	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
Vladimirsky	1
accent	1
Doubt	1
is	1
natural	1
to	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
mankind	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
pray	1
that	1
God	1
in	1
His	1
mercy	1
will	1
strengthen	1
us	1
What	1
are	1
your	1
special	1
sins	1
he	1
added	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
interval	1
as	1
though	1
anxious	1
not	1
to	1
waste	1
time	1
My	1
chief	1
sin	1
is	1
doubt	1
I	1
have	1
doubts	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
doubt	1
Doubt	1
is	1
natural	1
to	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
mankind	1
the	1
priest	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
doubt	1
about	1
principally	1
I	1
doubt	1
of	1
everything	1
I	1
sometimes	1
even	1
have	1
doubts	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
God	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
But	1
Levin	1
s	1
words	1
did	1
not	1
it	1
seemed	1
make	1
much	1
impression	1
on	1
the	1
priest	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
doubt	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
God	1
he	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
with	1
a	1
just	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
What	1
doubt	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
Creator	1
when	1
you	1
behold	1
His	1
creation	1
the	1
priest	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
customary	1
jargon	1
Who	1
has	1
decked	1
the	1
heavenly	1
firmament	1
with	1
its	1

without	1
the	1
Creator	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
improper	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
a	1
metaphysical	1
discussion	1
with	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
merely	1
what	1
was	1
a	1
direct	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
Then	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
doubt	1
that	1
God	1
created	1
all	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
with	1
good	1
humored	1
perplexity	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
said	1
Levin	1
blushing	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
stupid	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
stupid	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
Pray	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
beseech	1
Him	1
Even	1
the	1
holy	1
fathers	1
had	1
doubts	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
strengthen	1
their	1
faith	1
The	1
devil	1
has	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
resist	1
him	1
Pray	1
to	1
God	1
beseech	1
Him	1
Pray	1
to	1
God	1
he	1
repeated	1
hurriedly	1
The	1
priest	1
paused	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
as	1
though	1
meditating	1
You	1
re	1
about	1
I	1
hear	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
parishioner	1
and	1

Prince	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
he	1
resumed	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
An	1
excellent	1
young	1
lady	1
Yes	1
answered	1
Levin	1
blushing	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
about	1
this	1
at	1
confession	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
as	1
though	1
answering	1
his	1
thought	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
You	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
holy	1
matrimony	1
and	1
God	1
may	1
bless	1
you	1
with	1
offspring	1
Well	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
bringing	1
up	1
can	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
babes	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
overcome	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
enticing	1
you	1
to	1
infidelity	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
gentle	1
reproachfulness	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
your	1
child	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
father	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
desire	1
only	1
wealth	1
luxury	1
honor	1
for	1
your	1
infant	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
anxious	1
for	1
his	1
salvation	1
his	1
spiritual	1
enlightenment	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
truth	1
Eh	1
What	1
answer	1
will	1
you	1
make	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
innocent	1
babe	1
asks	1
you	1
Papa	1
who	1
made	1
all	1
that	1
enchants	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
the	1
earth	1
the	1
waters	1
the	1
sun	1
the	1
flowers	1
the	1
grass	1
Can	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
You	1
cannot	1
but	1
know	1
since	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
in	1
His	1
infinite	1
mercy	1
has	1
revealed	1
it	1
to	1
us	1
Or	1
your	1
child	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
What	1
awaits	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
beyond	1
the	1
tomb	1
What	1
will	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
How	1
will	1
you	1
answer	1
him	1
Will	1
you	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
allurements	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
That	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
Levin	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
gentle	1
eyes	1
Levin	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
this	1
time	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
a	1
discussion	1
with	1
the	1
priest	1
but	1
because	1
so	1
far	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
ever	1
asked	1
him	1
such	1
questions	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
babes	1
did	1
ask	1
him	1
those	1
questions	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
answering	1
them	1
You	1
are	1
entering	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
pursued	1
the	1
priest	1
when	1
you	1
must	1
choose	1
your	1
path	1
and	1
keep	1
to	1
it	1
Pray	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
He	1
may	1
in	1
His	1
mercy	1
aid	1
you	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
you	1
he	1
concluded	1
Our	1
Lord	1
and	1
God	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
and	1
riches	1
of	1
His	1
lovingkindness	1
forgives	1
this	1
child	1
and	1
finishing	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
absolution	1
the	1
priest	1
blessed	1
him	1
and	1
dismissed	1
him	1
On	1
getting	1
home	1
that	1
day	1
Levin	1
had	1
a	1
delightful	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
at	1
the	1
awkward	1
position	1
being	1
over	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
got	1
through	1
without	1
his	1
having	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
Apart	1
from	1
this	1
there	1
remained	1
a	1
vague	1
memory	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
kind	1
nice	1
old	1
fellow	1
had	1
said	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
so	1
stupid	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fancied	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
cleared	1
up	1
Of	1
course	1
not	1
now	1
thought	1
Levin	1
but	1
some	1
day	1
later	1
on	1
Levin	1
felt	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
now	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
clear	1
and	1
not	1
clean	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
religion	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
which	1
he	1
perceived	1
so	1
clearly	1
and	1
disliked	1
in	1
others	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
blamed	1
his	1
friend	1
Sviazhsky	1
Levin	1
spent	1
that	1
evening	1
with	1
his	1
betrothed	1
at	1
Dolly	1
s	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
high	1
spirits	1
To	1
explain	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
being	1
trained	1
to	1
jump	1
through	1
a	1
hoop	1
who	1
having	1
at	1
last	1
caught	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
done	1
what	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
him	1
whines	1
and	1
wags	1
its	1
tail	1
and	1
jumps	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
in	1
its	1
delight	1

On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
wedding	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
custom	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
insisted	1
on	1
strictly	1
keeping	1
all	1
the	1
customs	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
betrothed	1
and	1
dined	1
at	1
his	1
hotel	1
with	1
three	1
bachelor	1
friends	1
casually	1
brought	1
together	1
at	1
his	1
rooms	1
These	1
were	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Katavasov	1
a	1
university	1
friend	1
now	1
professor	1
of	1
natural	1
science	1
whom	1
Levin	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
taking	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
Tchirikov	1
his	1
best	1
man	1
a	1
Moscow	1
conciliation	1
board	1
judge	1
Levin	1
s	1
companion	1
in	1
his	1
bear	1
hunts	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
merry	1
one	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
happiest	1
mood	1
and	1
was	1
much	1
amused	1
by	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
originality	1
Katavasov	1
feeling	1
his	1
originality	1
was	1
appreciated	1
and	1
understood	1
made	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it	1
Tchirikov	1
always	1
gave	1
a	1
lively	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
support	1
to	1
conversation	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
See	1
now	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
drawling	1
his	1
words	1
from	1
a	1
habit	1
acquired	1
in	1
the	1
lecture	1
room	1
what	1
a	1
capable	1
fellow	1
was	1
our	1
friend	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
present	1
company	1
for	1
he	1
s	1
absent	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
he	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
science	1
took	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
humanity	1
now	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
his	1
abilities	1
is	1
devoted	1
to	1
deceiving	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
justifying	1
the	1
deceit	1
A	1
more	1
determined	1
enemy	1
of	1
matrimony	1
than	1
you	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Oh	1
no	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
an	1
enemy	1
of	1
matrimony	1
I	1

their	1
happiness	1
and	1

That	1
s	1
how	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
To	1
muddle	1
up	1
two	1
trades	1
is	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
the	1
amateur	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
How	1
happy	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
in	1
love	1
said	1
Levin	1
Please	1
invite	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
wedding	1
I	1
m	1

now	1
Yes	1
with	1
a	1
cuttlefish	1
You	1
know	1
Levin	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Mihail	1
Semyonovitch	1

writing	1
a	1

on	1
the	1

of	1

It	1
doesn	1

matter	1
what	1
about	1
And	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
I	1
certainly	1
do	1
love	1
cuttlefish	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
no	1
hindrance	1
to	1
your	1
loving	1
your	1
wife	1
The	1
cuttlefish	1
is	1
no	1
hindrance	1
The	1
wife	1
is	1
the	1
hindrance	1
Why	1
so	1
Oh	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
You	1
care	1
about	1
farming	1
hunting	1
well	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
look	1
out	1
Arhip	1
was	1
here	1
today	1
he	1
said	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
elks	1
in	1
Prudno	1
and	1
two	1
bears	1
said	1
Tchirikov	1
Well	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
them	1
without	1
me	1
Ah	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
And	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
bear	1
hunting	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
your	1
wife	1
won	1
t	1
allow	1
it	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
The	1
picture	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
not	1
letting	1
him	1
go	1
was	1
so	1
pleasant	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
renounce	1
the	1
delights	1
of	1
looking	1
upon	1
bears	1
forever	1
Still	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
should	1
get	1
those	1
two	1
bears	1
without	1
you	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
last	1
time	1
at	1
Hapilovo	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
delightful	1
hunt	1
said	1
Tchirikov	1
Levin	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
disillusion	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
something	1
delightful	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
so	1
said	1
nothing	1
There	1
s	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
this	1
custom	1
of	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
bachelor	1
life	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
However	1
happy	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
you	1
must	1
regret	1
your	1
freedom	1
And	1
confess	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
like	1
Gogol	1
s	1
bridegroom	1
Of	1
course	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
it	1
isn	1
t	1
confessed	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
and	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
loud	1
laughter	1
Oh	1
well	1
the	1
window	1
s	1
open	1
Let	1
s	1
start	1
off	1
this	1
instant	1
to	1
Tver	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
big	1
she	1
bear	1
one	1
can	1
go	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lair	1
Seriously	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
And	1
here	1
let	1
them	1
do	1
what	1
they	1
like	1
said	1
Tchirikov	1
smiling	1
Well	1
now	1
on	1
my	1
honor	1
said	1
Levin	1
smiling	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
find	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
regret	1
for	1
my	1
freedom	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
chaos	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
just	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
find	1
anything	1
there	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
when	1
you	1
set	1
it	1
to	1
rights	1
a	1
little	1
you	1
ll	1
find	1
it	1
No	1
if	1
so	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
apart	1
from	1
my	1
feeling	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
love	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
happiness	1
a	1
certain	1
regret	1
at	1
losing	1
my	1
freedom	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
loss	1
of	1
my	1
freedom	1
Awful	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
hopeless	1
case	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
Well	1
let	1
s	1
drink	1
to	1
his	1
recovery	1
or	1
wish	1
that	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
dreams	1
may	1
be	1
realized	1
and	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
happiness	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
on	1
earth	1
Soon	1
after	1
dinner	1
the	1
guests	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
dressed	1
for	1
the	1
wedding	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
and	1
recalled	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
these	1
bachelor	1
friends	1
Levin	1
asked	1
himself	1
had	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
regret	1
for	1
his	1
freedom	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
spoken	1
He	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
Freedom	1
What	1
is	1
freedom	1
for	1
Happiness	1
is	1
only	1
in	1
loving	1
and	1
wishing	1
her	1
wishes	1
thinking	1
her	1
thoughts	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
not	1
freedom	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
happiness	1
But	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
her	1
ideas	1
her	1
wishes	1
her	1
feelings	1
some	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
whispered	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
smile	1
died	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
thoughtful	1
And	1
suddenly	1
a	1
strange	1
feeling	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
There	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
a	1
dread	1
and	1
doubt	1
doubt	1
of	1
everything	1
What	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
me	1
What	1
if	1
she	1
s	1
marrying	1
me	1
simply	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
What	1
if	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
see	1
herself	1
what	1
she	1
s	1
doing	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
She	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
senses	1
and	1
only	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
being	1
married	1
realize	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
love	1
me	1
And	1
strange	1
most	1
evil	1
thoughts	1
of	1
her	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
been	1
yesterday	1
He	1
suspected	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
told	1
him	1
everything	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
quickly	1
No	1
this	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
despair	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
ll	1
ask	1
her	1
I	1
ll	1
say	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
we	1
are	1
free	1
and	1
hadn	1
t	1
we	1
better	1
stay	1
so	1
Anything	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
endless	1
misery	1
disgrace	1
unfaithfulness	1
With	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
bitter	1
anger	1
against	1
all	1
men	1
against	1
himself	1
against	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hotel	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
He	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
rooms	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
chest	1
and	1
making	1
some	1
arrangements	1
with	1
her	1
maid	1
sorting	1
over	1
heaps	1
of	1
dresses	1
of	1
different	1
colors	1
spread	1
on	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
chairs	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
Ah	1
she	1
cried	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
beaming	1
with	1
delight	1
Kostya	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
These	1
latter	1
days	1
she	1
used	1
these	1
names	1
almost	1
alternately	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
expect	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
through	1
my	1
wardrobe	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
s	1
for	1
whom	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
nice	1
he	1
said	1
gloomily	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
maid	1
You	1
can	1
go	1
Dunyasha	1
I	1
ll	1
call	1
you	1
presently	1
said	1
Kitty	1
Kostya	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
she	1
asked	1
definitely	1
adopting	1
this	1
familiar	1
name	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
maid	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
She	1
noticed	1
his	1
strange	1
face	1
agitated	1
and	1
gloomy	1
and	1
a	1
panic	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
Kitty	1
I	1
m	1
in	1
torture	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
suffer	1
alone	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
standing	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
looking	1
imploringly	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
He	1
saw	1
already	1
from	1
her	1
loving	1
truthful	1
face	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
come	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
herself	1
I	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
still	1
time	1
This	1
can	1
all	1
be	1
stopped	1
and	1
set	1
right	1
What	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
over	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
you	1
You	1
couldn	1
t	1
consent	1
to	1
marry	1
me	1
Think	1
a	1
little	1
You	1
ve	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
Think	1
it	1
over	1
thoroughly	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
love	1
me	1
If	1
better	1
say	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
wretched	1
Let	1
people	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
like	1
anything	1
s	1
better	1
than	1
misery	1
Far	1
better	1
now	1
while	1
there	1
s	1
still	1
time	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
she	1
answered	1
panic	1
stricken	1
you	1
mean	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
it	1
Yes	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
me	1
You	1
re	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mind	1
she	1
cried	1
turning	1
crimson	1
with	1
vexation	1
But	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
piteous	1
that	1
she	1
restrained	1
her	1
vexation	1
and	1
flinging	1
some	1
clothes	1
off	1
an	1
armchair	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
love	1
me	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
love	1
me	1
for	1
My	1
God	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
Oh	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
kneeling	1
before	1
her	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
When	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
five	1
minutes	1
later	1
she	1
found	1
them	1
completely	1
reconciled	1
Kitty	1
had	1
not	1
simply	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
but	1
had	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
question	1
what	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
for	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
understood	1
him	1
completely	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
and	1
because	1
everything	1
he	1
liked	1
was	1
good	1
And	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
perfectly	1
clear	1
When	1
the	1
princess	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
sitting	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
on	1
the	1
chest	1
sorting	1
the	1
dresses	1
and	1
disputing	1
over	1
Kitty	1
s	1
wanting	1
to	1
give	1
Dunyasha	1
the	1
brown	1
dress	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wearing	1
when	1
Levin	1
proposed	1
to	1
her	1
while	1
he	1
insisted	1
that	1
that	1
dress	1
must	1
never	1
be	1
given	1
away	1
but	1
Dunyasha	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
blue	1
one	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
brunette	1
and	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
suit	1
her	1
I	1
ve	1
worked	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
Hearing	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
half	1
humorously	1
half	1
seriously	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
home	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
hinder	1
Kitty	1
s	1
hair	1
dressing	1
as	1
Charles	1
the	1
hair	1
dresser	1
was	1
just	1
coming	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
she	1
s	1
been	1
eating	1
nothing	1
lately	1
and	1
is	1
losing	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
upset	1
her	1
with	1
your	1
nonsense	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
Get	1
along	1
with	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
Levin	1
guilty	1
and	1
shamefaced	1
but	1
pacified	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
hotel	1
His	1
brother	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
all	1
in	1
full	1
dress	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
lose	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
to	1
drive	1
home	1
again	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
curled	1
and	1
pomaded	1
son	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
holy	1
pictures	1
after	1
the	1
bride	1
Then	1
a	1
carriage	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
and	1
another	1
that	1
would	1
take	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
away	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
back	1
Altogether	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
most	1
complicated	1
matters	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
and	1
arranged	1
One	1
thing	1
was	1
unmistakable	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
delay	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
Nothing	1
special	1
happened	1
at	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
benediction	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
comically	1
solemn	1
pose	1
beside	1
his	1
wife	1
took	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
and	1
telling	1
Levin	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
blessed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
kindly	1
ironical	1
smile	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
three	1
times	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
immediately	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
and	1
again	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
intricate	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
destinations	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
carriages	1
Come	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
we	1
ll	1
manage	1
you	1
drive	1
in	1
our	1
carriage	1
to	1
fetch	1
him	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
if	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
will	1
drive	1
there	1
and	1
then	1
send	1
his	1
carriage	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
We	1
ll	1
come	1
on	1
directly	1
with	1
him	1
Are	1
your	1
things	1
sent	1
off	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Yes	1
answered	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
Kouzma	1
to	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
clothes	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
dress	1
Chapter	1
3	1
A	1
crowd	1
of	1
people	1
principally	1
women	1
was	1
thronging	1
round	1
the	1
church	1
lighted	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
wedding	1
Those	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
main	1
entrance	1
were	1
crowding	1
about	1
the	1
windows	1
pushing	1
wrangling	1
and	1
peeping	1
through	1
the	1
gratings	1
More	1
than	1
twenty	1
carriages	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
drawn	1
up	1
in	1
ranks	1
along	1
the	1
street	1
by	1
the	1
police	1
A	1
police	1
officer	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
frost	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
gorgeous	1
in	1
his	1
uniform	1
More	1
carriages	1
were	1
continually	1
driving	1
up	1
and	1
ladies	1
wearing	1
flowers	1
and	1
carrying	1
their	1
trains	1
and	1
men	1
taking	1
off	1
their	1
helmets	1
or	1
black	1
hats	1
kept	1
walking	1
into	1
the	1
church	1
Inside	1
the	1
church	1
both	1
lusters	1
were	1
already	1
lighted	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
candles	1
before	1
the	1
holy	1
pictures	1
The	1
gilt	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
stand	1
and	1
the	1
gilt	1
relief	1
on	1
the	1
pictures	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
of	1
the	1
lusters	1
and	1
candlesticks	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
the	1
rugs	1
and	1
the	1
banners	1
above	1
in	1
the	1
choir	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
blackened	1
books	1
and	1
the	1
cassocks	1
and	1
surplices	1
all	1
were	1
flooded	1
with	1
light	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
warm	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
frock	1
coats	1
and	1
white	1
ties	1
uniforms	1
and	1
broadcloth	1
velvet	1
satin	1
hair	1
and	1
flowers	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
and	1
arms	1
and	1
long	1
gloves	1
there	1
was	1
discreet	1
but	1
lively	1
conversation	1
that	1
echoed	1
strangely	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
cupola	1
Every	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
creak	1
of	1
the	1
opened	1
door	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
died	1
away	1
and	1
everybody	1
looked	1
round	1
expecting	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
come	1
in	1
But	1
the	1
door	1
had	1
opened	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
times	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
either	1
a	1
belated	1
guest	1
or	1
guests	1
who	1
joined	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
invited	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
or	1
a	1
spectator	1
who	1
had	1
eluded	1
or	1
softened	1
the	1
police	1
officer	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
outsiders	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
Both	1
the	1
guests	1
and	1
the	1
outside	1
public	1
had	1
by	1
now	1
passed	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
phases	1
of	1
anticipation	1
At	1
first	1
they	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
would	1
arrive	1
immediately	1
and	1
attached	1
no	1
importance	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
their	1
being	1
late	1
Then	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
whether	1
anything	1
could	1
have	1
happened	1
Then	1
the	1
long	1
delay	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
positively	1
discomforting	1
and	1
relations	1
and	1
guests	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
but	1
were	1
engrossed	1
in	1
conversation	1
The	1
head	1
deacon	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
remind	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
coughed	1
impatiently	1
making	1
the	1
window	1
panes	1
quiver	1
in	1
their	1
frames	1
In	1
the	1
choir	1
the	1
bored	1
choristers	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
trying	1
their	1
voices	1
and	1
blowing	1
their	1
noses	1
The	1
priest	1
was	1
continually	1
sending	1
first	1
the	1
beadle	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
deacon	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
he	1
went	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
vestment	1
and	1
an	1
embroidered	1
sash	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
door	1
expecting	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
At	1
last	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
said	1
It	1
really	1
is	1
strange	1
though	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
became	1
uneasy	1
and	1
began	1
loudly	1
expressing	1
their	1
wonder	1
and	1
dissatisfaction	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
s	1
best	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
Kitty	1
meanwhile	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
been	1
quite	1
ready	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
white	1
dress	1
and	1
long	1
veil	1
and	1
wreath	1
of	1
orange	1
blossoms	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
who	1
was	1
her	1
bridal	1
mother	1
She	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
over	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
anxiously	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
that	1
her	1
bridegroom	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
Levin	1
meanwhile	1
in	1
his	1
trousers	1
but	1
without	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
waistcoat	1
was	1
walking	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
hotel	1
continually	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
corridor	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
in	1
despair	1
and	1
frantically	1
waving	1
his	1
hands	1
addressed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
was	1
smoking	1
serenely	1
Was	1
ever	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fearful	1
fool	1
s	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
Yes	1
it	1
is	1
stupid	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
assented	1
smiling	1
soothingly	1
But	1
don	1
t	1
worry	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
brought	1
directly	1
No	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
said	1
Levin	1
with	1
smothered	1
fury	1
And	1
these	1
fools	1
of	1
open	1
waistcoats	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
crumpled	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
shirt	1
And	1
what	1
if	1
the	1
things	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
he	1
roared	1
in	1
desperation	1
Then	1
you	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
mine	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
if	1
at	1
all	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
nice	1
to	1
look	1
ridiculous	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
The	1
point	1
was	1
that	1
when	1
Levin	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
evening	1
suit	1
Kouzma	1
his	1
old	1
servant	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
coat	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
wanted	1
But	1
the	1
shirt	1
cried	1
Levin	1
You	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
shirt	1
on	1
Kouzma	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
placid	1
smile	1
Kouzma	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
leaving	1
out	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt	1
and	1
on	1
receiving	1
instructions	1
to	1
pack	1
up	1
everything	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
packing	1
everything	1
but	1
the	1
dress	1
suit	1
The	1
shirt	1
worn	1
since	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
crumpled	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
the	1
fashionable	1
open	1
waistcoat	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
They	1
sent	1
out	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
shirt	1
The	1
servant	1
came	1
back	1
everything	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
it	1
was	1
Sunday	1
They	1
sent	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
shirt	1
it	1
was	1
impossibly	1
wide	1
and	1
short	1
They	1
sent	1
finally	1
to	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
to	1
unpack	1
the	1
things	1
The	1
bridegroom	1
was	1
expected	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
peeping	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
despair	1
recalling	1
what	1
absurd	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Kitty	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
thinking	1
now	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
guilty	1
Kouzma	1
flew	1
panting	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
shirt	1
Only	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
They	1
were	1
just	1
lifting	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
van	1
said	1
Kouzma	1
Three	1
minutes	1
later	1
Levin	1
ran	1
full	1
speed	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
aggravating	1
his	1
sufferings	1
You	1
won	1
t	1
help	1
matters	1
like	1
this	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
hurrying	1
with	1
more	1
deliberation	1
after	1
him	1
It	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
round	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Chapter	1
4	1
They	1
ve	1
come	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
Which	1
one	1
Rather	1
young	1
eh	1
Why	1
my	1
dear	1
soul	1
she	1
looks	1
more	1
dead	1
than	1
alive	1
were	1
the	1
comments	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
when	1
Levin	1
meeting	1
his	1
bride	1
in	1
the	1
entrance	1
walked	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
church	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
told	1
his	1
wife	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
delay	1
and	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
whispering	1
it	1
with	1
smiles	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
Levin	1
saw	1
nothing	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
bride	1
Everyone	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
looks	1
dreadfully	1
of	1
late	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
pretty	1
on	1
her	1
wedding	1
day	1
as	1
usual	1
but	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
hair	1
done	1
up	1
high	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
white	1
veil	1
and	1
white	1
flowers	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
stand	1
up	1
scalloped	1
collar	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
maidenly	1
fashion	1
hid	1
her	1
long	1
neck	1
at	1
the	1
sides	1
and	1
only	1
showed	1
it	1
in	1
front	1
her	1
strikingly	1
slender	1
figure	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
better	1
than	1
ever	1
not	1
because	1
these	1
flowers	1
this	1
veil	1
this	1
gown	1
from	1
Paris	1
added	1
anything	1
to	1
her	1
beauty	1
but	1
because	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
elaborate	1
sumptuousness	1
of	1
her	1
attire	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
sweet	1
face	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
was	1
still	1
her	1
own	1
characteristic	1
expression	1
of	1
guileless	1
truthfulness	1
I	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
smiled	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
stupid	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
ashamed	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
reddening	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
pretty	1
story	1
of	1
yours	1
about	1
the	1
shirt	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
yes	1
answered	1
Levin	1
without	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
Now	1
Kostya	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
decide	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
mock	1
dismay	1
a	1
weighty	1
question	1
You	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
humor	1
to	1
appreciate	1
all	1
its	1
gravity	1
They	1
ask	1
me	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
candles	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
lighted	1
before	1
or	1
candles	1
that	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
lighted	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
ten	1
roubles	1
he	1
added	1
relaxing	1
his	1
lips	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
I	1
have	1
decided	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
you	1
might	1
not	1
agree	1
Levin	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
joke	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
smile	1
Well	1
how	1
s	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
then	1
unlighted	1
or	1
lighted	1
candles	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
question	1
Yes	1
yes	1
unlighted	1
Oh	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
The	1
question	1
s	1
decided	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
How	1
silly	1
men	1
are	1
though	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Tchirikov	1
when	1
Levin	1
after	1
looking	1
absently	1
at	1
him	1
had	1
moved	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
bride	1
Kitty	1
mind	1
you	1
re	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
step	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
said	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
coming	1
up	1
You	1
re	1
a	1
nice	1
person	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
Aren	1
t	1
you	1
frightened	1
eh	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
an	1
old	1
aunt	1
Are	1
you	1
cold	1
You	1
re	1
pale	1
Stop	1
a	1
minute	1
stoop	1
down	1
said	1
Kitty	1
s	1
sister	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
plump	1
handsome	1
arms	1
she	1
smilingly	1
set	1
straight	1
the	1
flowers	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
Dolly	1
came	1
up	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
cried	1
and	1
then	1
laughed	1
unnaturally	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
absent	1
eyes	1
as	1
Levin	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
officiating	1
clergy	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
their	1
vestments	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
deacon	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
lectern	1
which	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
forepart	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
The	1
priest	1
turned	1
to	1
Levin	1
saying	1
something	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
Take	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
hand	1
and	1
lead	1
her	1
up	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
before	1
Levin	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
right	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
begin	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
kept	1
taking	1
Kitty	1
by	1
the	1
wrong	1
arm	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
wrong	1
arm	1
till	1
he	1
understood	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
without	1
changing	1
his	1
position	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
When	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
correct	1
way	1
the	1
priest	1
walked	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
lectern	1
The	1
crowd	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
moved	1
after	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
buzz	1
of	1
talk	1
and	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
skirts	1
Someone	1
stooped	1
down	1
and	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
train	1
The	1
church	1
became	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
the	1
drops	1
of	1
wax	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
falling	1
from	1
the	1
candles	1
The	1
little	1
old	1
priest	1
in	1
his	1
ecclesiastical	1
cap	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
silvery	1
gray	1
locks	1
of	1
hair	1
parted	1
behind	1
his	1
ears	1
was	1
fumbling	1
with	1
something	1
at	1
the	1
lectern	1
putting	1
out	1
his	1
little	1
old	1
hands	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
heavy	1
silver	1
vestment	1
with	1
the	1
gold	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
approached	1
him	1
cautiously	1
whispered	1
something	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
Levin	1
walked	1
back	1
again	1
The	1
priest	1
lighted	1
two	1
candles	1
wreathed	1
with	1
flowers	1
and	1
holding	1
them	1
sideways	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wax	1
dropped	1
slowly	1
from	1
them	1
he	1
turned	1
facing	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
The	1
priest	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
man	1
that	1
had	1
confessed	1
Levin	1
He	1
looked	1
with	1
weary	1
and	1
melancholy	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
sighed	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
vestment	1
blessed	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
solicitous	1
tenderness	1
laid	1
the	1
crossed	1
fingers	1
on	1
the	1
bowed	1
head	1
of	1
Kitty	1
Then	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
candles	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
censer	1
moved	1
slowly	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
bride	1
Looking	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
profile	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
quiver	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
eyelashes	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
her	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round	1
but	1
the	1
high	1
scalloped	1
collar	1
that	1
reached	1
her	1
little	1
pink	1
ear	1
trembled	1
faintly	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
sigh	1
was	1
held	1
back	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
glove	1
shook	1
as	1
it	1
held	1
the	1
candle	1
All	1
the	1
fuss	1
of	1
the	1
shirt	1
of	1
being	1
late	1
all	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
their	1
annoyance	1
his	1
ludicrous	1
position	1
all	1
suddenly	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
dread	1
The	1
handsome	1
stately	1
head	1
deacon	1
wearing	1
a	1
silver	1
robe	1
and	1
his	1
curly	1
locks	1
standing	1
out	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
stepped	1
smartly	1
forward	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
stole	1
on	1
two	1
fingers	1
stood	1
opposite	1
the	1
priest	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
solemn	1
syllables	1

Blessed	1

from	1

be	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
priest	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
submissive	1
piping	1
voice	1
still	1
fingering	1
something	1
at	1
the	1
lectern	1
And	1
the	1
full	1
chorus	1
of	1
the	1
unseen	1
choir	1
rose	1
up	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
from	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
the	1
vaulted	1
roof	1
with	1
broad	1
waves	1
of	1
melody	1
It	1
grew	1
stronger	1
rested	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
slowly	1
died	1
away	1
They	1
prayed	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
do	1
for	1
peace	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
and	1
for	1
salvation	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Synod	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Tsar	1
they	1
prayed	1
too	1
for	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
God	1
Konstantin	1
and	1
Ekaterina	1
now	1
plighting	1
their	1
troth	1
Vouchsafe	1
to	1
them	1
love	1
made	1
perfect	1
peace	1
and	1
help	1
O	1
Lord	1
we	1
beseech	1
Thee	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
seemed	1
to	1
breathe	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
deacon	1
Levin	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
they	1
impressed	1
him	1
How	1
did	1
they	1
guess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
help	1
just	1
help	1
that	1
one	1
wants	1
he	1
thought	1
recalling	1
all	1
his	1
fears	1
and	1
doubts	1
of	1
late	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
in	1
this	1
fearful	1
business	1
he	1
thought	1
without	1
help	1
Yes	1
it	1
is	1
help	1
I	1
want	1
now	1
When	1
the	1
deacon	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
the	1
priest	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
Eternal	1
God	1
that	1
joinest	1
together	1
in	1
love	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
separate	1
he	1
read	1
in	1
a	1
gentle	1
piping	1
voice	1
who	1
hast	1
ordained	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
holy	1
wedlock	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
set	1
asunder	1
Thou	1
who	1
didst	1
bless	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Rebecca	1
and	1
their	1
descendants	1

to	1
Thy	1

For	1

the	1
unseen	1
choir	1
sent	1
rolling	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
air	1
Joinest	1
together	1
in	1
love	1

that	1
were	1

What	1
deep	1
meaning	1
in	1
those	1
words	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
correspond	1
with	1
what	1
one	1
feels	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
thought	1
Levin	1
Is	1
she	1
feeling	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
I	1
And	1
looking	1
round	1
he	1
met	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
expression	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
understanding	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
mistake	1
she	1
almost	1
completely	1
missed	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
them	1
in	1
fact	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
strong	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
feeling	1
that	1
filled	1
her	1
breast	1
and	1
grew	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
That	1
feeling	1
was	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
process	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
had	1
during	1
those	1
six	1
weeks	1
been	1
a	1
joy	1
and	1
a	1
torture	1
to	1
her	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
Arbaty	1
Street	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
brown	1
dress	1
and	1
given	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
at	1
that	1
hour	1
there	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
a	1
complete	1
severance	1
from	1
all	1
her	1
old	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
new	1
utterly	1
strange	1
life	1
had	1
begun	1
for	1
her	1
while	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
was	1
actually	1
going	1
on	1
as	1
before	1
Those	1
six	1
weeks	1
had	1
for	1
her	1
been	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
bliss	1
and	1
the	1
utmost	1
misery	1
All	1
her	1
life	1
all	1
her	1
desires	1
and	1
hopes	1
were	1
concentrated	1
on	1
this	1
one	1
man	1
still	1
uncomprehended	1
by	1
her	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
bound	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
alternate	1
attraction	1
and	1
repulsion	1
even	1
less	1
comprehended	1
than	1
the	1
man	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
outward	1
conditions	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
life	1
Living	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
herself	1
at	1
her	1
utter	1
insurmountable	1
callousness	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
past	1
to	1
things	1
to	1
habits	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
had	1
loved	1
who	1
loved	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
who	1
was	1
wounded	1
by	1
her	1
indifference	1
to	1
her	1
kind	1
tender	1
father	1
till	1
then	1
dearer	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
At	1
one	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
this	1
indifference	1
at	1
another	1
she	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
indifference	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
frame	1
a	1
thought	1
not	1
a	1
wish	1
apart	1
from	1
life	1
with	1
this	1
man	1
but	1
this	1
new	1
life	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
picture	1
it	1
clearly	1
to	1
herself	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
anticipation	1
the	1
dread	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
and	1
the	1
unknown	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
anticipation	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
remorse	1
at	1
the	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
life	1
all	1
was	1
ending	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
was	1
beginning	1
This	1
new	1
life	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
have	1
terrors	1
for	1
her	1
inexperience	1
but	1
terrible	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
change	1
had	1
been	1
wrought	1
six	1
weeks	1
before	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
final	1
sanction	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
completed	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
Turning	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
lectern	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
took	1
Kitty	1
s	1
little	1
ring	1
and	1
asking	1
Levin	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
joint	1
of	1
his	1
finger	1
The	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
Konstantin	1
plights	1
his	1
troth	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
Ekaterina	1
And	1
putting	1
his	1
big	1
ring	1
on	1
Kitty	1
s	1
touchingly	1
weak	1
pink	1
little	1
finger	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
And	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
tried	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
made	1
some	1
mistake	1
and	1
were	1
corrected	1
by	1
the	1
priest	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
At	1
last	1
having	1
duly	1
performed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
having	1
signed	1
the	1
rings	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
the	1
priest	1
handed	1
Kitty	1
the	1
big	1
ring	1
and	1
Levin	1
the	1
little	1
one	1
Again	1
they	1
were	1
puzzled	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
rings	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand	1
still	1
without	1
doing	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
Dolly	1
Tchirikov	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
stepped	1
forward	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
right	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
hesitation	1
whispering	1
and	1
smiles	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
solemn	1
emotion	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
betrothed	1
pair	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
in	1
their	1
perplexity	1
over	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
looked	1
more	1
grave	1
and	1
deeply	1
moved	1
than	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
whispered	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
now	1
they	1
would	1
each	1
put	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
ring	1
died	1
away	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
any	1
smile	1
would	1
jar	1
on	1
them	1
Thou	1
who	1
didst	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1

Levin	1
felt	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
ideas	1
of	1
marriage	1
all	1
his	1
dreams	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
order	1
his	1
life	1
were	1
mere	1
childishness	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
hitherto	1
and	1
now	1
understood	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
being	1
performed	1
upon	1
him	1
The	1
lump	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
rose	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
tears	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
checked	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
Chapter	1
5	1
In	1
the	1
church	1
there	1
was	1
all	1
Moscow	1
all	1
the	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
plighting	1
troth	1
in	1
the	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
church	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
incessant	1
flow	1
of	1
discreetly	1
subdued	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
gaily	1
dressed	1
women	1
and	1
girls	1
and	1
men	1
in	1
white	1
ties	1
frockcoats	1
and	1
uniforms	1
The	1
talk	1
was	1
principally	1
kept	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
while	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
absorbed	1
in	1
watching	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony	1
which	1
always	1
means	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
little	1
group	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
bride	1
were	1
her	1
two	1
sisters	1
Dolly	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
the	1
self	1
possessed	1
beauty	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
from	1
abroad	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
Marie	1
s	1
in	1
lilac	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
black	1
at	1
a	1
wedding	1
said	1
Madame	1
Korsunskaya	1
With	1
her	1
complexion	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
one	1
salvation	1
responded	1
Madame	1
Trubetskaya	1
I	1
wonder	1
why	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
wedding	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
It	1
s	1
like	1
shop	1
people	1
So	1
much	1
prettier	1
I	1
was	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
too	1
answered	1
Madame	1
Korsunskaya	1
and	1
she	1
sighed	1
remembering	1
how	1
charming	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
how	1
absurdly	1
in	1
love	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
different	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
now	1
They	1
say	1
if	1
anyone	1
s	1
best	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
times	1
he	1
ll	1
never	1
be	1
married	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time	1
but	1
the	1
post	1
was	1
taken	1
said	1
Count	1
Siniavin	1
to	1
the	1
pretty	1
Princess	1
Tcharskaya	1
who	1
had	1
designs	1
on	1
him	1
Princess	1
Tcharskaya	1
only	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Kitty	1
thinking	1
how	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
stand	1
with	1
Count	1
Siniavin	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
place	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
remind	1
him	1
then	1
of	1
his	1
joke	1
today	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
told	1
the	1
old	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
Madame	1
Nikolaeva	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
crown	1
on	1
Kitty	1
s	1
chignon	1
for	1
luck	1
She	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
worn	1
a	1
chignon	1
answered	1
Madame	1
Nikolaeva	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
elderly	1
widower	1
she	1
was	1
angling	1
for	1
married	1
her	1
the	1
wedding	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
simplest	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
such	1
grandeur	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Darya	1
Dmitrievna	1
jestingly	1
assuring	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
was	1
becoming	1
common	1
because	1
newly	1
married	1
people	1
always	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed	1
of	1
themselves	1
Your	1
brother	1
may	1
feel	1
proud	1
of	1
himself	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
marvel	1
of	1
sweetness	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
re	1
envious	1
Oh	1
I	1
ve	1
got	1
over	1
that	1
Darya	1
Dmitrievna	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
a	1
melancholy	1
and	1
serious	1
expression	1
suddenly	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
telling	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
his	1
joke	1
about	1
divorce	1
The	1
wreath	1
wants	1
setting	1
straight	1
she	1
answered	1
not	1
hearing	1
him	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
she	1
s	1
lost	1
her	1
looks	1
so	1
Countess	1
Nordston	1
said	1
to	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
Still	1
he	1
s	1

he	1
Oh	1
I	1
like	1
him	1
so	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
s	1
my	1
future	1
beau	1
fr`ere	1
answered	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
And	1
how	1
well	1
he	1
s	1
behaving	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
difficult	1
too	1
to	1
look	1
well	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ridiculous	1
And	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
not	1
affected	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
he	1
s	1
moved	1
You	1
expected	1
it	1
I	1
suppose	1
Almost	1
She	1
always	1
cared	1
for	1
him	1
Well	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
step	1
on	1
the	1
rug	1
first	1
I	1
warned	1
Kitty	1
It	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
difference	1
said	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
we	1
re	1
all	1
obedient	1
wives	1
it	1
s	1
in	1
our	1
family	1
Oh	1
I	1
stepped	1
on	1
the	1
rug	1
before	1
Vassily	1
on	1
purpose	1
And	1
you	1
Dolly	1
Dolly	1
stood	1
beside	1
them	1
she	1
heard	1
them	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
She	1
was	1
deeply	1
moved	1
The	1
tears	1
stood	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
spoken	1
without	1
crying	1
She	1
was	1
rejoicing	1
over	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Levin	1
going	1
back	1
in	1
thought	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
wedding	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
radiant	1
figure	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
forgot	1
all	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
remembered	1
only	1
her	1
own	1
innocent	1
love	1
She	1
recalled	1
not	1
herself	1
only	1
but	1
all	1
her	1
women	1
friends	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
triumph	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
stood	1
like	1
Kitty	1
under	1
the	1
wedding	1
crown	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
dread	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
renouncing	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
stepping	1
forward	1
into	1
the	1
mysterious	1
future	1
Among	1
the	1
brides	1
that	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
memory	1
she	1
thought	1
too	1
of	1
her	1
darling	1
Anna	1
of	1
whose	1
proposed	1
divorce	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
hearing	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
stood	1
just	1
as	1
innocent	1
in	1
orange	1
flowers	1
and	1
bridal	1
veil	1
And	1
now	1
It	1
s	1
terribly	1
strange	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
sisters	1
the	1
women	1
friends	1
and	1
female	1
relations	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
who	1
were	1
following	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony	1
Women	1
who	1
were	1
quite	1
strangers	1
mere	1
spectators	1
were	1
watching	1
it	1
excitedly	1
holding	1
their	1
breath	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
single	1
movement	1
or	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
and	1
angrily	1
not	1
answering	1
often	1
not	1
hearing	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
the	1
callous	1
men	1
who	1
kept	1
making	1
joking	1
or	1
irrelevant	1
observations	1
Why	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
crying	1
Is	1
she	1
being	1
married	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
Against	1
her	1
will	1
to	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
like	1
that	1
A	1
prince	1
isn	1
t	1
he	1
Is	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
satin	1
Just	1
listen	1
how	1
the	1
deacon	1
booms	1
out	1
And	1
fearing	1
her	1
husband	1
Are	1
the	1
choristers	1
from	1
Tchudovo	1
No	1
from	1
the	1
Synod	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
footman	1
He	1
says	1
he	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
place	1
at	1
once	1
Awfully	1
rich	1
they	1
say	1
That	1
s	1
why	1
she	1
s	1
being	1
married	1
to	1
him	1
No	1
they	1
re	1
a	1
well	1
matched	1
pair	1
I	1
say	1
Marya	1
Vassilievna	1
you	1
were	1
making	1
out	1
those	1
fly	1
away	1
crinolines	1
were	1
not	1
being	1
worn	1
Just	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
puce	1
dress	1
an	1
ambassador	1
s	1
wife	1
they	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
how	1
her	1
skirt	1
bounces	1
out	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
What	1
a	1
pretty	1
dear	1
the	1
bride	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
decked	1
with	1
flowers	1
Well	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
we	1
women	1
feel	1
for	1
our	1
sister	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
comments	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
gazing	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
slipping	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
church	1
doors	1
Chapter	1

When	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
plighting	1
troth	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
beadle	1
spread	1
before	1
the	1
lectern	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
pink	1
silken	1
stuff	1
the	1
choir	1
sang	1
a	1
complicated	1
and	1
elaborate	1
psalm	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
bass	1
and	1
tenor	1
sang	1
responses	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
turning	1
round	1
pointed	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
to	1
the	1
pink	1
silk	1
rug	1
Though	1
both	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
steps	1
first	1
on	1
the	1
rug	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
neither	1
Levin	1
nor	1
Kitty	1
were	1
capable	1
of	1
recollecting	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
few	1
steps	1
towards	1
it	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
loud	1
remarks	1
and	1
disputes	1
that	1
followed	1
some	1
maintaining	1
he	1
had	1
stepped	1
on	1
first	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
both	1
had	1
stepped	1
on	1
together	1
After	1
the	1
customary	1
questions	1
whether	1
they	1
desired	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
matrimony	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
pledged	1
to	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
their	1
answers	1
which	1
sounded	1
strange	1
to	1
themselves	1
a	1
new	1
ceremony	1
began	1
Kitty	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prayer	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
their	1
meaning	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
radiant	1
happiness	1
flooded	1
her	1
soul	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
as	1
the	1
ceremony	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
deprived	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
power	1
of	1
attention	1
They	1
prayed	1
Endow	1
them	1
with	1
continence	1
and	1
fruitfulness	1
and	1
vouchsafe	1
that	1
their	1
hearts	1
may	1
rejoice	1
looking	1
upon	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
They	1
alluded	1
to	1
God	1
s	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
Adam	1
s	1
rib	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
leave	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
cleave	1
unto	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mystery	1
they	1
prayed	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
fruitful	1
and	1
bless	1
them	1
like	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Rebecca	1
Joseph	1
Moses	1
and	1
Zipporah	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
look	1
upon	1
their	1
children	1
s	1
children	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
splendid	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
catching	1
the	1
words	1
all	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
unconsciously	1
reflected	1
in	1
everyone	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
beamed	1
on	1
her	1
radiant	1
face	1
Put	1
it	1
on	1
quite	1
voices	1
were	1
heard	1
urging	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
wedding	1
crowns	1
and	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
his	1
hand	1
shaking	1
in	1
its	1
three	1
button	1
glove	1
held	1
the	1
crown	1
high	1
above	1
her	1
head	1
Put	1
it	1
on	1
she	1
whispered	1
smiling	1
Levin	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
joyful	1
radiance	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
her	1
feeling	1
infected	1
him	1
He	1
too	1
like	1
her	1
felt	1
glad	1
and	1
happy	1
They	1
enjoyed	1
hearing	1
the	1
epistle	1
read	1
and	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
deacon	1
s	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
verse	1
awaited	1
with	1
such	1
impatience	1
by	1
the	1
outside	1
public	1
They	1
enjoyed	1
drinking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shallow	1
cup	1
of	1
warm	1
red	1
wine	1
and	1
water	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
more	1
pleased	1
when	1
the	1
priest	1
flinging	1
back	1
his	1
stole	1
and	1
taking	1
both	1
their	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
led	1
them	1
round	1
the	1
lectern	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
bass	1
voices	1
chanting	1
Glory	1
to	1
God	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
and	1
Tchirikov	1
supporting	1
the	1
crowns	1
and	1
stumbling	1
over	1
the	1
bride	1
s	1
train	1
smiling	1
too	1
and	1
seeming	1
delighted	1
at	1
something	1
were	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
left	1
behind	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
treading	1
on	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair	1
as	1
the	1
priest	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
The	1
spark	1
of	1
joy	1
kindled	1
in	1
Kitty	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
infected	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
deacon	1
too	1
wanted	1
to	1
smile	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
Taking	1
the	1
crowns	1
off	1
their	1
heads	1
the	1
priest	1
read	1
the	1
last	1
prayer	1
and	1
congratulated	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
Levin	1
looked	1
at	1
Kitty	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
her	1
look	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
She	1
was	1
charming	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
radiance	1
of	1
happiness	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
Levin	1
longed	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
The	1
priest	1
got	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
difficulty	1
He	1
smiled	1
his	1
kindly	1
smile	1
and	1
said	1
gently	1
Kiss	1
your	1
wife	1
and	1
you	1
kiss	1
your	1
husband	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
candles	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
Levin	1
kissed	1
her	1
smiling	1
lips	1
with	1
timid	1
care	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
strange	1
sense	1
of	1
closeness	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
their	1
wondering	1
and	1
timid	1
eyes	1
met	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
it	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
one	1

Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
had	1
been	1
traveling	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
together	1
in	1
Europe	1
They	1
had	1
visited	1
Venice	1
Rome	1
and	1
Naples	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
Italian	1
town	1
where	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
some	1
time	1
A	1
handsome	1
head	1
waiter	1
with	1
thick	1
pomaded	1
hair	1
parted	1
from	1
the	1
neck	1
upwards	1
an	1
evening	1
coat	1
a	1
broad	1
white	1
cambric	1
shirt	1
front	1
and	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
trinkets	1
hanging	1
above	1
his	1
rounded	1
stomach	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
curve	1
of	1
his	1
pockets	1
looking	1
contemptuously	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
eyelids	1
while	1
he	1
gave	1
some	1
frigid	1
reply	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
stopped	1
him	1
Catching	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
entry	1
towards	1
the	1
staircase	1
the	1
head	1
waiter	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
Russian	1
count	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
their	1
best	1
rooms	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pockets	1
deferentially	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
courier	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
about	1
the	1
palazzo	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
The	1
steward	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
sign	1
the	1
agreement	1
Ah	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Is	1
madame	1
at	1
home	1

not	1
Madame	1
has	1
been	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
but	1
has	1
returned	1
now	1
answered	1
the	1
waiter	1
Vronsky	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
soft	1
wide	1
brimmed	1
hat	1
and	1
passed	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
his	1
heated	1
brow	1
and	1
hair	1
which	1
had	1
grown	1
half	1
over	1
his	1
ears	1
and	1
was	1
brushed	1
back	1
covering	1
the	1
bald	1
patch	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
And	1
glancing	1
casually	1
at	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
still	1
stood	1
there	1
gazing	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
This	1
gentleman	1
is	1
a	1
Russian	1
and	1
was	1
inquiring	1
after	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
head	1
waiter	1
With	1
mingled	1
feelings	1
of	1
annoyance	1
at	1
never	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
acquaintances	1
anywhere	1
and	1
longing	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
diversion	1
from	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
retreated	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
again	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
light	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both	1
Golenishtchev	1
Vronsky	1
It	1
really	1
was	1
Golenishtchev	1
a	1
comrade	1
of	1

in	1
the	1
Corps	1
of	1
Pages	1
In	1

on	1
leaving	1
the	1
corps	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
met	1
once	1
since	1
At	1
that	1
meeting	1
Vronsky	1
perceived	1
that	1
Golenishtchev	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
lofty	1
intellectually	1
liberal	1
line	1
and	1
was	1
consequently	1
disposed	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
upon	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
interests	1
and	1
calling	1
in	1
life	1
Hence	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
chilling	1
and	1
haughty	1
manner	1
he	1
so	1
well	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
assume	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
You	1
may	1
like	1
or	1
dislike	1
my	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
treat	1
me	1
with	1
respect	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
Golenishtchev	1
had	1
been	1
contemptuously	1
indifferent	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
taken	1
by	1
Vronsky	1
This	1
second	1
meeting	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
to	1
estrange	1
them	1
still	1
more	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
beamed	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
delight	1
on	1
recognizing	1
one	1
another	1
Vronsky	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
Golenishtchev	1
but	1
probably	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
himself	1
aware	1
how	1
bored	1
he	1
was	1
He	1
forgot	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
of	1
their	1
last	1
meeting	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
frank	1
delight	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
comrade	1
The	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
delight	1
replaced	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
face	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
showing	1
his	1
strong	1
white	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
name	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
which	1
one	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
Let	1
s	1
go	1
in	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
re	1
doing	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
living	1
here	1
for	1
two	1
years	1
I	1
m	1
working	1
Ah	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
sympathy	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
in	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
habit	1
common	1
with	1
Russians	1
instead	1
of	1
saying	1
in	1
Russian	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
the	1
servants	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
French	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
We	1
are	1
traveling	1
together	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
carefully	1
scrutinizing	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
face	1
Ah	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
know	1
Golenishtchev	1
answered	1
carelessly	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
here	1
long	1
he	1
added	1
Four	1
days	1
Vronsky	1
answered	1
once	1
more	1
scrutinizing	1
his	1
friend	1
s	1
face	1
intently	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
decent	1
fellow	1
and	1
will	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
thing	1
properly	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
catching	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
subject	1
I	1
can	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
Anna	1
he	1
looks	1
at	1
it	1
properly	1
During	1
those	1
three	1
months	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
spent	1
abroad	1
with	1
Anna	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
on	1
meeting	1
new	1
people	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
the	1
new	1
person	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Anna	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
in	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
properly	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
exactly	1
how	1
they	1
did	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
greatly	1
puzzled	1
to	1
answer	1
In	1
reality	1
those	1
who	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
opinion	1
had	1
the	1
proper	1
view	1
had	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
view	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
behaved	1
in	1
general	1
as	1
well	1
bred	1
persons	1
do	1
behave	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
complex	1
and	1
insoluble	1
problems	1
with	1
which	1
life	1
is	1
encompassed	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
they	1
behaved	1
with	1
propriety	1
avoiding	1
allusions	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
questions	1
They	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
fully	1
comprehending	1
the	1
import	1
and	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
accepting	1
and	1
even	1
approving	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
of	1
considering	1
it	1
superfluous	1
and	1
uncalled	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
all	1
this	1
into	1
words	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
once	1
divined	1
that	1
Golenishtchev	1
was	1
of	1
this	1
class	1
and	1
therefore	1
was	1
doubly	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
manner	1
to	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
her	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
have	1
desired	1
Obviously	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
effort	1
he	1
steered	1
clear	1
of	1
all	1
subjects	1
which	1
might	1
lead	1
to	1
embarrassment	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
Anna	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
frankness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
accepted	1
her	1
position	1
She	1
blushed	1
when	1
Vronsky	1
brought	1
in	1
Golenishtchev	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
charmed	1
by	1
this	1
childish	1
blush	1
overspreading	1
her	1
candid	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
But	1
what	1
he	1
liked	1
particularly	1
was	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
purpose	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
no	1
misunderstanding	1
with	1
an	1
outsider	1
she	1
called	1
Vronsky	1
simply	1
Alexey	1
and	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
moving	1
into	1
a	1
house	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
taken	1
what	1
was	1
here	1
called	1
a	1
palazzo	1
Golenishtchev	1
liked	1
this	1
direct	1
and	1
simple	1
attitude	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
Looking	1
at	1
Anna	1
s	1
manner	1
of	1
simple	1
hearted	1
spirited	1
gaiety	1
and	1
knowing	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
Golenishtchev	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
perfectly	1
He	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
having	1
made	1
her	1
husband	1
wretched	1
having	1
abandoned	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
lost	1
her	1
good	1
name	1
she	1
yet	1
felt	1
full	1
of	1
spirits	1
gaiety	1
and	1
happiness	1
It	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
guide	1
book	1
said	1
Golenishtchev	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
palazzo	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
taken	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
Tintoretto	1
there	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
latest	1
period	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
lovely	1
day	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
another	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
addressing	1
Anna	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
hat	1
Would	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
hot	1
she	1
said	1
stopping	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
and	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
And	1
again	1
a	1
vivid	1
flush	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
on	1
what	1
terms	1
he	1
cared	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Golenishtchev	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
not	1
behaving	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
wish	1
He	1
looked	1
a	1
long	1
tender	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
No	1
not	1
very	1
he	1
said	1
And	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
everything	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
smiling	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
her	1
rapid	1
step	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
The	1
friends	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
hesitation	1
came	1
into	1
both	1
faces	1
as	1
though	1
Golenishtchev	1
unmistakably	1
admiring	1
her	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
while	1
Vronsky	1
desired	1
and	1
dreaded	1
his	1
doing	1
so	1
Well	1
then	1
Vronsky	1
began	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
settled	1
here	1
You	1
re	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
work	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
recalling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
Golenishtchev	1
was	1
writing	1
something	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
writing	1
the	1
second	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Two	1
Elements	1
said	1
Golenishtchev	1
coloring	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exact	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
writing	1
it	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
preparing	1
collecting	1
materials	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
far	1
wider	1
scope	1
and	1
will	1
touch	1
on	1
almost	1
all	1
questions	1
We	1
in	1
Russia	1
refuse	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
heirs	1
of	1
Byzantium	1
and	1
he	1
launched	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
heated	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
views	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
felt	1
embarrassed	1
at	1
not	1
even	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Two	1
Elements	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
author	1
spoke	1
as	1
something	1
well	1
known	1
But	1
as	1
Golenishtchev	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
opinions	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
even	1
without	1
knowing	1
the	1
Two	1
Elements	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
interest	1
for	1
Golenishtchev	1
spoke	1
well	1
But	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
startled	1
and	1
annoyed	1
by	1
the	1
nervous	1
irascibility	1
with	1
which	1
Golenishtchev	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
engrossed	1
him	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
his	1
eyes	1
glittered	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angrily	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
hurried	1
in	1
his	1
replies	1
to	1
imaginary	1
opponents	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited	1
and	1
worried	1
Remembering	1
Golenishtchev	1
a	1
thin	1
lively	1
good	1
natured	1
and	1
well	1
bred	1
boy	1
always	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
class	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
irritability	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
What	1
he	1
particularly	1
disliked	1
was	1
that	1
Golenishtchev	1
a	1
man	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
set	1
should	1
put	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
some	1
scribbling	1
fellows	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
irritated	1
and	1
angry	1
Was	1
it	1
worth	1
it	1
Vronsky	1
disliked	1
it	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
Golenishtchev	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
Unhappiness	1
almost	1
mental	1
derangement	1
was	1
visible	1
on	1
his	1
mobile	1
rather	1
handsome	1
face	1
while	1
without	1
even	1
noticing	1
Anna	1
s	1
coming	1
in	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
hotly	1
expressing	1
his	1
views	1
When	1
Anna	1
came	1
in	1
in	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
cape	1
and	1
her	1
lovely	1
hand	1
rapidly	1
swinging	1
her	1
parasol	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
relief	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
broke	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
plaintive	1
eyes	1
of	1
Golenishtchev	1
which	1
fastened	1
persistently	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
charming	1
companion	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
happiness	1
Golenishtchev	1
recovered	1
himself	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
dejected	1
and	1
gloomy	1
but	1
Anna	1
disposed	1
to	1
feel	1
friendly	1
with	1
everyone	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
soon	1
revived	1
his	1
spirits	1
by	1
her	1
direct	1
and	1
lively	1
manner	1
After	1
trying	1
various	1
subjects	1
of	1
conversation	1
she	1
got	1
him	1
upon	1
painting	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
talked	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
attentively	1
They	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
looked	1
over	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
one	1
thing	1
said	1
Anna	1
to	1
Golenishtchev	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
back	1
Alexey	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
capital	1
atelier	1
You	1
must	1
certainly	1
take	1
that	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
Russian	1
using	1
the	1
affectionately	1
familiar	1
form	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Golenishtchev	1
would	1
become	1
intimate	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
isolation	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
reserve	1
before	1
him	1
Do	1
you	1
paint	1
said	1
Golenishtchev	1
turning	1
round	1
quickly	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
Yes	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
study	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
little	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
reddening	1
He	1
has	1
great	1
talent	1
said	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
delighted	1
smile	1
I	1
m	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
course	1
But	1
good	1
judges	1
have	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Anna	1
in	1
that	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
her	1
emancipation	1
and	1
rapid	1
return	1

health	1
felt	1
herself	1
unpardonably	1
happy	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
life	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
unhappiness	1
did	1
not	1
poison	1
her	1
happiness	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
that	1
memory	1
was	1
too	1
awful	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
unhappiness	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
too	1
much	1
happiness	1
to	1
be	1
regretted	1
The	1
memory	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
after	1
her	1
illness	1
her	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
its	1
breakdown	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
wound	1
his	1
visit	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
divorce	1
the	1
departure	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
house	1
the	1
parting	1
from	1
her	1
son	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
delirious	1
dream	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
waked	1
up	1
alone	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
abroad	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
harm	1
caused	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
feeling	1
like	1
repulsion	1
and	1
akin	1
to	1
what	1
a	1
drowning	1
man	1
might	1
feel	1
who	1
has	1
shaken	1
off	1
another	1
man	1
clinging	1
to	1
him	1
That	1
man	1
did	1
drown	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
action	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
and	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
brood	1
over	1
these	1
fearful	1
facts	1
One	1
consolatory	1
reflection	1
upon	1
her	1
conduct	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
final	1
rupture	1
and	1
when	1
now	1
she	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
one	1
reflection	1
I	1
have	1
inevitably	1
made	1
that	1
man	1
wretched	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
his	1
misery	1
I	1
too	1
am	1
suffering	1
and	1
shall	1
suffer	1
I	1
am	1
losing	1
what	1
I	1
prized	1
above	1
everything	1
I	1
am	1
losing	1
my	1
good	1
name	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
wrong	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
happiness	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
shall	1
suffer	1
from	1
my	1
shame	1
and	1
the	1
separation	1
from	1
my	1
child	1
But	1
however	1
sincerely	1
Anna	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
suffer	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
suffering	1
Shame	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
With	1
the	1
tact	1
of	1
which	1
both	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
large	1
share	1
they	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
avoiding	1
Russian	1
ladies	1
abroad	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
never	1
placed	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
false	1
position	1
and	1
everywhere	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
people	1
who	1
pretended	1
that	1
they	1
perfectly	1
understood	1
their	1
position	1
far	1
better	1
indeed	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
themselves	1
Separation	1
from	1
the	1
son	1
she	1
loved	1
even	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
anguish	1
in	1
these	1
early	1
days	1
The	1
baby	1
girl	1
his	1
child	1
was	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
had	1
so	1
won	1
Anna	1
s	1
heart	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
her	1
that	1
Anna	1
rarely	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
The	1
desire	1
for	1
life	1
waxing	1
stronger	1
with	1
recovered	1
health	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
and	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
so	1
new	1
and	1
pleasant	1
that	1
Anna	1
felt	1
unpardonably	1
happy	1
The	1
more	1
she	1
got	1
to	1
know	1
Vronsky	1
the	1
more	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
She	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
Her	1
complete	1
ownership	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
continual	1
joy	1
to	1
her	1
His	1
presence	1
was	1
always	1
sweet	1
to	1
her	1
All	1
the	1
traits	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
which	1
she	1
learned	1
to	1
know	1
better	1
and	1
better	1
were	1
unutterably	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
His	1
appearance	1
changed	1
by	1
his	1
civilian	1
dress	1
was	1
as	1
fascinating	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
some	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
love	1
In	1
everything	1
he	1
said	1
thought	1
and	1
did	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
particularly	1
noble	1
and	1
elevated	1
Her	1
adoration	1
of	1
him	1
alarmed	1
her	1
indeed	1
she	1
sought	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
anything	1
not	1
fine	1
She	1
dared	1
not	1
show	1
him	1
her	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
insignificance	1
beside	1
him	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
knowing	1
this	1
he	1
might	1
sooner	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
dreaded	1
nothing	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
losing	1
his	1
love	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
fearing	1
it	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
showing	1
that	1
she	1
appreciated	1
it	1
He	1
who	1
had	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
such	1
a	1
marked	1
aptitude	1
for	1
a	1
political	1
career	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
certain	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
leading	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
his	1
ambition	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
and	1
never	1
betrayed	1
the	1
slightest	1
regret	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
lovingly	1
respectful	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
care	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
never	1
deserted	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
He	1
so	1
manly	1
a	1
man	1
never	1
opposed	1
her	1
had	1
indeed	1
with	1
her	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
was	1
anxious	1
it	1
seemed	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
anticipate	1
her	1
wishes	1
And	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
appreciate	1
this	1
even	1
though	1
the	1
very	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
solicitude	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
care	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
surrounded	1
her	1
sometimes	1
weighed	1
upon	1
her	1
Vronsky	1
meanwhile	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
realization	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
desired	1
was	1
not	1
perfectly	1
happy	1
He	1
soon	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
realization	1
of	1
his	1
desires	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
sand	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
happiness	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
It	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
mistake	1
men	1
make	1
in	1
picturing	1
to	1
themselves	1
happiness	1
as	1
the	1
realization	1
of	1
their	1
desires	1
For	1
a	1
time	1
after	1
joining	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
hers	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
civilian	1
dress	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
general	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
nothing	1
before	1
and	1
of	1
freedom	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
content	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
long	1
He	1
was	1
soon	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
springing	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
desires	1
ennui	1
Without	1
conscious	1
intention	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
clutch	1
at	1
every	1
passing	1
caprice	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
desire	1
and	1
an	1
object	1
Sixteen	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
must	1
be	1
occupied	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
since	1
they	1
were	1
living	1
abroad	1
in	1
complete	1
freedom	1
outside	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
social	1
life	1
which	1
filled	1
up	1
time	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
amusements	1
of	1
bachelor	1
existence	1
which	1
had	1
provided	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
entertainment	1
on	1
previous	1
tours	1
abroad	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
since	1
the	1
sole	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
had	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
attack	1
of	1
depression	1
in	1
Anna	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
proportion	1
with	1
the	1
cause	1
a	1
late	1
supper	1
with	1
bachelor	1
friends	1
Relations	1
with	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
foreign	1
and	1
Russian	1
were	1
equally	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
irregularity	1
of	1
their	1
position	1
The	1
inspection	1
of	1
objects	1
of	1
interest	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
already	1
had	1
not	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
a	1
Russian	1
and	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
the	1
immense	1
significance	1
Englishmen	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
attach	1
to	1
that	1
pursuit	1
And	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
hungry	1
stomach	1
eagerly	1
accepts	1
every	1
object	1
it	1
can	1
get	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
nourishment	1
in	1
it	1
Vronsky	1
quite	1
unconsciously	1
clutched	1
first	1
at	1
politics	1
then	1
at	1
new	1
books	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
pictures	1
As	1
he	1
had	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
painting	1
and	1
as	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
money	1
on	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
collecting	1
engravings	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop	1
at	1
painting	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
unoccupied	1
mass	1
of	1
desires	1
which	1
demanded	1
satisfaction	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
ready	1
appreciation	1
of	1
art	1
and	1
probably	1
with	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
imitating	1
art	1
he	1
supposed	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
essential	1
for	1
an	1
artist	1
and	1
after	1
hesitating	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
which	1
style	1
of	1
painting	1
to	1
select	1
religious	1
historical	1
realistic	1
or	1
genre	1
painting	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
paint	1
He	1
appreciated	1
all	1
kinds	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
felt	1
inspired	1
by	1
anyone	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
any	1
school	1
of	1
painting	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
inspired	1
directly	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
soul	1
without	1
caring	1
whether	1
what	1
is	1
painted	1
will	1
belong	1
to	1
any	1
recognized	1
school	1
Since	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
inspiration	1
not	1
directly	1
from	1
life	1
but	1
indirectly	1
from	1
life	1
embodied	1
in	1
art	1
his	1
inspiration	1
came	1
very	1
quickly	1
and	1
easily	1
and	1
as	1
quickly	1
and	1
easily	1
came	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
painting	1
something	1
very	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
painting	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
imitate	1
More	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
style	1
he	1
liked	1
the	1
French	1
graceful	1
and	1
effective	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
style	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
paint	1
Anna	1
s	1
portrait	1
in	1
Italian	1
costume	1
and	1
the	1
portrait	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
everyone	1
who	1
saw	1
it	1
extremely	1
successful	1

hung	1
with	1

this	1
palazzo	1
did	1
much	1
by	1
its	1
very	1
appearance	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
moved	1
into	1
it	1
to	1
confirm	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
the	1
agreeable	1
illusion	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
Russian	1
country	1
gentleman	1
a	1
retired	1
army	1
officer	1
as	1
an	1
enlightened	1
amateur	1
and	1
patron	1
of	1
the	1
arts	1
himself	1
a	1
modest	1
artist	1
who	1
had	1
renounced	1
the	1
world	1
his	1
connections	1
and	1
his	1
ambition	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
The	1
pose	1
chosen	1
by	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
their	1
removal	1
into	1
the	1
palazzo	1
was	1
completely	1
successful	1
and	1
having	1
through	1
Golenishtchev	1
made	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
interesting	1
people	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
He	1
painted	1
studies	1
from	1
nature	1
under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
an	1
Italian	1
professor	1
of	1
painting	1
and	1
studied	1
mediaeval	1
Italian	1
life	1
Mediaeval	1
Italian	1
life	1
so	1
fascinated	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
wore	1
a	1
hat	1
and	1
flung	1
a	1
cloak	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
in	1
the	1
mediaeval	1
style	1
which	1
indeed	1
was	1
extremely	1
becoming	1
to	1
him	1
Here	1
we	1
live	1
and	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
s	1
going	1
on	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
to	1
Golenishtchev	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
one	1
morning	1
Have	1
you	1
seen	1
Mihailov	1
s	1
picture	1
he	1
said	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
Russian	1
gazette	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
that	1
morning	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
an	1
article	1
on	1
a	1
Russian	1
artist	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
town	1
and	1
just	1
finishing	1
a	1
picture	1
which	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
talked	1
about	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
bought	1
beforehand	1
The	1
article	1
reproached	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
the	1
academy	1
for	1
letting	1
so	1
remarkable	1
an	1
artist	1
be	1
left	1
without	1
encouragement	1
and	1
support	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
it	1
answered	1
Golenishtchev	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
without	1
talent	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
wrong	1
direction	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
Ivanov	1
Strauss	1
Renan	1
attitude	1
to	1
Christ	1
and	1
to	1
religious	1
painting	1

Christ	1
before	1
Pilate	1
Christ	1
is	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
Jew	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
realism	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
school	1
And	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
having	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
favorite	1
theories	1
Golenishtchev	1
launched	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
disquisition	1
on	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
they	1
can	1
fall	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
gross	1
mistake	1
Christ	1
always	1
has	1
His	1
definite	1
embodiment	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
masters	1
And	1
therefore	1
if	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
depict	1
not	1
God	1
but	1
a	1
revolutionist	1
or	1
a	1
sage	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
from	1
history	1
a	1
Socrates	1
a	1
Franklin	1
a	1
Charlotte	1
Corday	1
but	1
not	1
Christ	1
They	1
take	1
the	1
very	1
figure	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
their	1
art	1
and	1
then	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
this	1
Mihailov	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
poverty	1
asked	1
Vronsky	1
thinking	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
Russian	1
Maecenas	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
assist	1
the	1
artist	1
regardless	1
of	1
whether	1
the	1
picture	1
were	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
not	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
remarkable	1
portrait	1
painter	1
Have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
his	1
portrait	1
of	1
Madame	1
Vassiltchikova	1
But	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
care	1
about	1
painting	1
any	1
more	1
portraits	1
and	1
so	1
very	1
likely	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
want	1
I	1
maintain	1
that	1
Couldn	1
t	1
we	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Why	1
mine	1
said	1
Anna	1
After	1
yours	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
another	1
portrait	1
Better	1
have	1
one	1
of	1
Annie	1
so	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
baby	1
girl	1
Here	1
she	1
is	1
she	1
added	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
Italian	1
nurse	1
who	1
was	1
carrying	1
the	1
child	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
immediately	1
glancing	1
unnoticed	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
The	1
handsome	1
nurse	1
from	1
whom	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
painting	1
a	1
head	1
for	1
his	1
picture	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
hidden	1
grief	1
in	1
Anna	1
s	1
life	1
He	1
painted	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
model	1
admired	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
mediaevalism	1
and	1
Anna	1
dared	1
not	1
confess	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
becoming	1
jealous	1
of	1
this	1
nurse	1
and	1
was	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
particularly	1
gracious	1
and	1
condescending	1
both	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
son	1
Vronsky	1
too	1
glanced	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
into	1
Anna	1
s	1
eyes	1
and	1
turning	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
Golenishtchev	1
he	1
said	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
this	1
Mihailov	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
queer	1
fish	1
and	1
quite	1
without	1
breeding	1
You	1
know	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
uncouth	1
new	1
people	1
one	1
s	1
so	1
often	1
coming	1
across	1
nowadays	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
free	1
thinkers	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
are	1
reared	1
d	1
embl'ee	1
in	1
theories	1
of	1
atheism	1
scepticism	1
and	1
materialism	1
In	1
former	1
days	1
said	1
Golenishtchev	1
not	1
observing	1
or	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
both	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
the	1
free	1
thinker	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
ideas	1
of	1
religion	1
law	1
and	1
morality	1
and	1
only	1
through	1
conflict	1
and	1
struggle	1
came	1
to	1
free	1
thought	1
but	1
now	1
there	1
has	1
sprung	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
type	1
of	1
born	1
free	1
thinkers	1
who	1
grow	1
up	1
without	1
even	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
principles	1
of	1
morality	1
or	1
of	1
religion	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
authorities	1
who	1
grow	1
up	1
directly	1
in	1
ideas	1
of	1
negation	1
in	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
savages	1
Well	1
he	1
s	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
He	1
s	1
the	1
son	1
it	1
appears	1
of	1
some	1
Moscow	1
butler	1
and	1
has	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
bringing	1
up	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
academy	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
reputation	1
he	1
tried	1
as	1
he	1
s	1
no	1
fool	1
to	1
educate	1
himself	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
very	1
source	1
of	1
culture	1
the	1
magazines	1
In	1
old	1
times	1
you	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
educate	1
himself	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
for	1
instance	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
study	1
all	1
the	1
classics	1
and	1
theologians	1
and	1
tragedians	1
and	1
historiaris	1
and	1
philosophers	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
intellectual	1
work	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
But	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
he	1
goes	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
negation	1
very	1
quickly	1
assimilates	1
all	1
the	1
extracts	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
negation	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
ready	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
all	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
that	1
literature	1
traces	1
of	1
conflict	1
with	1
authorities	1
with	1
the	1
creeds	1
of	1
the	1
ages	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
perceived	1
from	1
this	1
conflict	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
comes	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
literature	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
creeds	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
furnish	1
matter	1
for	1
discussion	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
stated	1
baldly	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
evolution	1
natural	1
selection	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
In	1
my	1
article	1
I	1
ve	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
said	1
Anna	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
been	1
exchanging	1
wary	1
glances	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
this	1
artist	1
but	1
was	1
simply	1
absorbed	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
assisting	1
him	1
and	1
ordering	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
resolutely	1
interrupting	1
Golenishtchev	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
talking	1
away	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
Golenishtchev	1
recovered	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
and	1
readily	1
agreed	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
artist	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
remote	1
suburb	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
carriage	1
An	1
hour	1
later	1
Anna	1
with	1
Golenishtchev	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
facing	1
them	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
ugly	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
remote	1
suburb	1
On	1
learning	1
from	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
wife	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
Mihailov	1
saw	1
visitors	1
at	1
his	1
studio	1
but	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
lodging	1
only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
steps	1
off	1
they	1
sent	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
cards	1
asking	1
permission	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
picture	1
Chapter	1
10	1
The	1
artist	1
Mihailov	1
was	1
as	1
always	1
at	1
work	1
when	1
the	1
cards	1
of	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Golenishtchev	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
working	1
in	1
his	1
studio	1
at	1
his	1
big	1
picture	1
On	1
getting	1
home	1
he	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
rage	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
managed	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
landlady	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
asking	1
for	1
money	1
I	1
ve	1
said	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
twenty	1
times	1
don	1
t	1
enter	1
into	1
details	1
You	1
re	1
fool	1
enough	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
start	1
explaining	1
things	1
in	1
Italian	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
fool	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
foolish	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
dispute	1
Don	1
t	1
let	1
it	1
run	1
so	1
long	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
Leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
Mihailov	1
shrieked	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
stopping	1
his	1
ears	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
his	1
working	1
room	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
partition	1
wall	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him	1
Idiotic	1
woman	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
opening	1
a	1
portfolio	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
peculiar	1
fervor	1
at	1
a	1
sketch	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
Never	1
did	1
he	1
work	1
with	1
such	1
fervor	1
and	1
success	1
as	1
when	1
things	1
went	1
ill	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
quarreled	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Oh	1
damn	1
them	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
working	1
He	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
sketch	1
for	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
rage	1
A	1
sketch	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
before	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
it	1
No	1
that	1
one	1
was	1
better	1
where	1
is	1
it	1
He	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
scowling	1
and	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
asked	1
his	1
eldest	1
little	1
girl	1
where	1
was	1
that	1
piece	1
of	1
paper	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
The	1
paper	1
with	1
the	1
discarded	1
sketch	1
on	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
dirty	1
and	1
spotted	1
with	1
candle	1
grease	1
Still	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
sketch	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
table	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
little	1
away	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
gazing	1
at	1
it	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
smiled	1
and	1
gesticulated	1
gleefully	1
That	1
s	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
picking	1
up	1
the	1
pencil	1
he	1
began	1
rapidly	1
drawing	1
The	1
spot	1
of	1
tallow	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
new	1
pose	1
He	1
had	1
sketched	1
this	1
new	1
pose	1
when	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
shopkeeper	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
cigars	1
a	1
vigorous	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
prominent	1
chin	1
and	1
he	1
sketched	1
this	1
very	1
face	1
this	1
chin	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
He	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
with	1
delight	1
The	1
figure	1
from	1
a	1
lifeless	1
imagined	1
thing	1
had	1
become	1
living	1
and	1
such	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
changed	1
That	1
figure	1
lived	1
and	1
was	1
clearly	1
and	1
unmistakably	1
defined	1
The	1
sketch	1
might	1
be	1
corrected	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
requirements	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
the	1
legs	1
indeed	1
could	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
differently	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
must	1
be	1
quite	1
altered	1
the	1
hair	1
too	1
might	1
be	1
thrown	1
back	1
But	1
in	1
making	1
these	1
corrections	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
altering	1
the	1
figure	1
but	1
simply	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
what	1
concealed	1
the	1
figure	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
stripping	1
off	1
the	1
wrappings	1
which	1
hindered	1
it	1
from	1
being	1
distinctly	1
seen	1
Each	1
new	1
feature	1
only	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
figure	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
force	1
and	1
vigor	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
of	1
tallow	1
He	1
was	1
carefully	1
finishing	1
the	1
figure	1
when	1
the	1
cards	1
were	1
brought	1
him	1
Coming	1
coming	1
He	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
Come	1
Sasha	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
cross	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
timidly	1
and	1
affectionately	1
at	1
her	1
You	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
I	1
ll	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
And	1
having	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
an	1
olive	1
green	1
overcoat	1
with	1
a	1
velvet	1
collar	1
and	1
a	1
hat	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
his	1
studio	1
The	1
successful	1
figure	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
forgotten	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
delighted	1
and	1
excited	1
at	1
the	1
visit	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
of	1
consequence	1
Russians	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
their	1
carriage	1
Of	1
his	1
picture	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
stood	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
easel	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
one	1
conviction	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
ever	1
painted	1
a	1
picture	1
like	1
it	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
his	1
picture	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
pictures	1
of	1
Raphael	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
convey	1
in	1
that	1
picture	1
no	1
one	1
ever	1
had	1
conveyed	1
This	1
he	1
knew	1
positively	1
and	1
had	1
known	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
paint	1
it	1
But	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
criticisms	1
whatever	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
had	1
yet	1
immense	1
consequence	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
they	1
agitated	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
Any	1
remark	1
the	1
most	1
insignificant	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
critic	1
saw	1
even	1
the	1
tiniest	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
picture	1
agitated	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
He	1
always	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
critics	1
a	1
more	1
profound	1
comprehension	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
and	1
always	1
expected	1
from	1
them	1
something	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
picture	1
And	1
often	1
in	1
their	1
criticisms	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
this	1
He	1
walked	1
rapidly	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
studio	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
excitement	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
soft	1
light	1
on	1
Anna	1
s	1
figure	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
listening	1
to	1
Golenishtchev	1
who	1
was	1
eagerly	1
telling	1
her	1
something	1
while	1
she	1
evidently	1
wanted	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
artist	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
unconscious	1
how	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
them	1
he	1
seized	1
on	1
this	1
impression	1
and	1
absorbed	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
chin	1
of	1
the	1
shopkeeper	1
who	1
had	1
sold	1
him	1
the	1
cigars	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
away	1
somewhere	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
it	1
The	1
visitors	1
not	1
agreeably	1
impressed	1
beforehand	1
by	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
were	1
still	1
less	1
so	1
by	1
his	1
personal	1
appearance	1
Thick	1
set	1
and	1
of	1
middle	1
height	1
with	1
nimble	1
movements	1
with	1
his	1
brown	1
hat	1
olive	1
green	1
coat	1
and	1
narrow	1
trousers	1
though	1
wide	1
trousers	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
fashion	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
ordinariness	1
of	1
his	1
broad	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
combined	1
expression	1
of	1
timidity	1
and	1
anxiety	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
his	1
dignity	1
Mihailov	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
Please	1
step	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
to	1
look	1
indifferent	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
key	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
Chapter	1
11	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
studio	1
Mihailov	1
once	1
more	1
scanned	1
his	1
visitors	1
and	1
noted	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
expression	1
too	1
and	1
especially	1
his	1
jaws	1
Although	1
his	1
artistic	1
sense	1
was	1
unceasingly	1
at	1
work	1
collecting	1
materials	1
although	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
continually	1
increasing	1
excitement	1
as	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
criticizing	1
his	1
work	1
drew	1
nearer	1
he	1
rapidly	1
and	1
subtly	1
formed	1
from	1
imperceptible	1
signs	1
a	1
mental	1
image	1
of	1
these	1
three	1
persons	1
That	1
fellow	1
Golenishtchev	1
was	1
a	1
Russian	1
living	1
here	1
Mihailov	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
his	1
surname	1
nor	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
nor	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
only	1
remembered	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
but	1
he	1
remembered	1
too	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
faces	1
laid	1
by	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
in	1
the	1
immense	1
class	1
of	1
the	1
falsely	1
consequential	1
and	1
poor	1
in	1
expression	1
The	1
abundant	1
hair	1
and	1
very	1
open	1
forehead	1
gave	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
consequence	1
to	1
the	1
face	1
which	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
expression	1
a	1
petty	1
childish	1
peevish	1
expression	1
concentrated	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
the	1
narrow	1
nose	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
must	1
be	1
Mihailov	1
supposed	1
distinguished	1
and	1
wealthy	1
Russians	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
about	1
art	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
wealthy	1
Russians	1
but	1
posing	1
as	1
amateurs	1
and	1
connoisseurs	1
Most	1
likely	1
they	1
ve	1
already	1
looked	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
antiques	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
re	1
making	1
the	1
round	1
of	1
the	1
studios	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
people	1
the	1
German	1
humbug	1
and	1
the	1
cracked	1
Pre	1
Raphaelite	1
English	1
fellow	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
complete	1
he	1
thought	1
He	1
was	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
way	1
dilettanti	1
have	1
the	1
cleverer	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
worse	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
contemporary	1
artists	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
art	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
sees	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
men	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
sees	1
how	1
inimitable	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
old	1
masters	1
have	1
remained	1
He	1
expected	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
their	1
faces	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
careless	1
indifference	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
talked	1
among	1
themselves	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
lay	1
figures	1
and	1
busts	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
leisurely	1
fashion	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
uncover	1
his	1
picture	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
over	1
his	1
studies	1
pulling	1
up	1
the	1
blinds	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
sheet	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
intense	1
excitement	1
especially	1
as	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
distinguished	1
and	1
wealthy	1
Russians	1
were	1
certain	1
to	1
be	1
beasts	1
and	1
fools	1
he	1
liked	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
Anna	1
Here	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
he	1
said	1
moving	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
his	1
nimble	1
gait	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
picture	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
exhortation	1
to	1
Pilate	1
Matthew	1
chapter	1
xxvii	1
he	1
said	1
feeling	1
his	1
lips	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
tremble	1
with	1
emotion	1
He	1
moved	1
away	1
and	1
stood	1
behind	1
them	1
For	1
the	1
few	1
seconds	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
visitors	1
were	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
picture	1
in	1
silence	1
Mihailov	1
too	1
gazed	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
indifferent	1
eye	1
of	1
an	1
outsider	1
For	1
those	1
few	1
seconds	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
in	1
anticipation	1
that	1
a	1
higher	1
juster	1
criticism	1
would	1
be	1
uttered	1
by	1
them	1
by	1
those	1
very	1
visitors	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
despising	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
He	1
forgot	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
about	1
his	1
picture	1
before	1
during	1
the	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
painting	1
it	1
he	1
forgot	1
all	1
its	1
qualities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
picture	1
with	1
their	1
indifferent	1
new	1
outside	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
good	1
in	1
it	1
He	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
foreground	1
Pilate	1
s	1
irritated	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
serene	1
face	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
Pilate	1
s	1
retinue	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
John	1
watching	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
Every	1
face	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
agony	1
such	1
blunders	1
and	1
corrections	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
within	1
him	1
with	1
its	1
special	1
character	1
every	1
face	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
such	1
torments	1
and	1
such	1
raptures	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
faces	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
transposed	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
harmony	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
all	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
color	1
and	1
tones	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
attained	1
with	1
such	1
labor	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
together	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
the	1
merest	1
vulgarity	1
something	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
over	1
The	1
face	1
dearest	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Christ	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
such	1
ecstasy	1
as	1
it	1
unfolded	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
utterly	1
lost	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
picture	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
He	1
saw	1
a	1
well	1
painted	1
no	1
not	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
now	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
defects	1
repetition	1
of	1
those	1
endless	1
Christs	1
of	1
Titian	1
Raphael	1
Rubens	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
soldiers	1
and	1
Pilate	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
common	1
poor	1
and	1
stale	1
and	1
positively	1
badly	1
painted	1
weak	1
and	1
unequal	1
They	1
would	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
repeating	1
hypocritically	1
civil	1
speeches	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
painter	1
and	1
pitying	1
him	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
again	1
The	1
silence	1
though	1
it	1
lasted	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
minute	1
became	1
too	1
intolerable	1
to	1
him	1
To	1
break	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
agitated	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
and	1
addressed	1
Golenishtchev	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
ve	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
meeting	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
first	1
at	1
Anna	1
then	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
any	1
shade	1
of	1
their	1
expression	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
We	1
met	1
at	1
Rossi	1
s	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
at	1
that	1
soir'ee	1
when	1
that	1
Italian	1
lady	1
recited	1
the	1
new	1
Rachel	1
Golenishtchev	1
answered	1
easily	1
removing	1
his	1
eyes	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
regret	1
from	1
the	1
picture	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
artist	1
Noticing	1
however	1
that	1
Mihailov	1
was	1
expecting	1
a	1
criticism	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
he	1
said	1
Your	1
picture	1
has	1
got	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
last	1
time	1
and	1
what	1
strikes	1
me	1
particularly	1
now	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Pilate	1
One	1
so	1
knows	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
capital	1
fellow	1
but	1
an	1
official	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
s	1
doing	1
But	1
I	1
fancy	1
All	1
Mihailov	1
s	1
mobile	1
face	1
beamed	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
for	1
excitement	1
and	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
coughing	1
Low	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
opinion	1
of	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
capacity	1
for	1
understanding	1
art	1
trifling	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
remark	1
upon	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
Pilate	1
as	1
an	1
official	1
and	1
offensive	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
seemed	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
so	1
unimportant	1
an	1
observation	1
while	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
more	1
serious	1
points	1
Mihailov	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
delight	1
at	1
this	1
observation	1
He	1
had	1
himself	1
thought	1
about	1
Pilate	1
s	1
figure	1
just	1
what	1
Golenishtchev	1
said	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
this	1
reflection	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
reflections	1
which	1
as	1
Mihailov	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
would	1
be	1
true	1
did	1
not	1
diminish	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
remark	1
His	1
heart	1
warmed	1
to	1
Golenishtchev	1
for	1
this	1
remark	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
depression	1
he	1
suddenly	1
passed	1
to	1
ecstasy	1
At	1
once	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
lived	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
indescribable	1
complexity	1
of	1
everything	1
living	1
Mihailov	1
again	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
he	1
understood	1
Pilate	1
but	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
intractably	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
pronounce	1
the	1
words	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
too	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
that	1
subdued	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
partly	1
to	1
avoid	1
hurting	1
the	1
artist	1
s	1
feelings	1
and	1
partly	1
to	1
avoid	1
saying	1
out	1
loud	1
something	1
silly	1
so	1
easily	1
said	1
when	1
talking	1
of	1
art	1
people	1
usually	1
speak	1
at	1
exhibitions	1
of	1
pictures	1
Mihailov	1
fancied	1
that	1
the	1
picture	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
them	1
too	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
How	1
marvelous	1
Christ	1
s	1
expression	1
is	1
said	1
Anna	1
Of	1
all	1
she	1
saw	1
she	1
liked	1
that	1
expression	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
and	1
so	1
praise	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
artist	1
One	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
He	1
is	1
pitying	1
Pilate	1
This	1
again	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
million	1
true	1
reflections	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
picture	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Christ	1
She	1
said	1
that	1
He	1
was	1
pitying	1
Pilate	1
In	1
Christ	1
s	1
expression	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
indeed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
pity	1
since	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
love	1
of	1
heavenly	1
peace	1
of	1
readiness	1
for	1
death	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
words	1
Of	1
course	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
an	1
official	1
in	1
Pilate	1
and	1
of	1
pity	1
in	1
Christ	1
seeing	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
incarnation	1
of	1
the	1
fleshly	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
spiritual	1
life	1
All	1
this	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
flashed	1
into	1
Mihailov	1
s	1
thoughts	1
Yes	1
and	1
how	1
that	1
figure	1
is	1
done	1
what	1
atmosphere	1
One	1
can	1
walk	1
round	1
it	1
said	1
Golenishtchev	1
unmistakably	1
betraying	1
by	1
this	1
remark	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
and	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
figure	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
wonderful	1
mastery	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
How	1
those	1
figures	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
stand	1
out	1
There	1
you	1
have	1
technique	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
Golenishtchev	1
alluding	1
to	1
a	1
conversation	1
between	1
them	1
about	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
despair	1
of	1
attaining	1
this	1
technique	1
Yes	1
yes	1
marvelous	1
Golenishtchev	1
and	1
Anna	1
assented	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
excited	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
sentence	1
about	1
technique	1
had	1
sent	1
a	1
pang	1
to	1
Mihailov	1
s	1
heart	1
and	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
suddenly	1
scowled	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
this	1
word	1
technique	1
and	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
understood	1
by	1
it	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
term	1
was	1
understood	1
a	1
mechanical	1
facility	1
for	1
painting	1
or	1
drawing	1
entirely	1
apart	1
from	1
its	1
subject	1
He	1
had	1
noticed	1
often	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
actual	1
praise	1
technique	1
was	1
opposed	1
to	1
essential	1
quality	1
as	1
though	1
one	1
could	1
paint	1
well	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
bad	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
attention	1
and	1
care	1
was	1
necessary	1
in	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
coverings	1
to	1
avoid	1
injuring	1
the	1
creation	1
itself	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
coverings	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
art	1
of	1
painting	1
no	1
technique	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
about	1
it	1
If	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
cook	1
were	1
revealed	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
or	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
peel	1
the	1
wrappings	1
off	1
what	1
was	1
seen	1
And	1
the	1
most	1
experienced	1
and	1
adroit	1
painter	1
could	1
not	1
by	1
mere	1
mechanical	1
facility	1
paint	1
anything	1
if	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
were	1
not	1
revealed	1
to	1
him	1
first	1
Besides	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
talking	1
about	1
technique	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
praise	1
him	1
for	1
it	1
In	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
painted	1
and	1
repainted	1
he	1
saw	1
faults	1
that	1
hurt	1
his	1
eyes	1
coming	1
from	1
want	1
of	1
care	1
in	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
wrappings	1
faults	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
correct	1
now	1
without	1
spoiling	1
the	1
whole	1
And	1
in	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
figures	1
and	1
faces	1
he	1
saw	1
too	1
remnants	1
of	1
the	1
wrappings	1
not	1
perfectly	1
removed	1
that	1
spoiled	1
the	1
picture	1
One	1
thing	1
might	1
be	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
remark	1
observed	1
Golenishtchev	1
Oh	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
said	1
Mihailov	1
with	1
a	1
forced	1
smile	1
That	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
make	1
Him	1
the	1
man	1
god	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
man	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
I	1
cannot	1
paint	1
a	1
Christ	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
said	1
Mihailov	1
gloomily	1
Yes	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
Your	1
picture	1
is	1
so	1
fine	1
that	1
my	1
observation	1
cannot	1
detract	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
besides	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
my	1
personal	1
opinion	1
With	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
different	1
Your	1
very	1
motive	1
is	1
different	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
Ivanov	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
if	1
Christ	1
is	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
an	1
historical	1
character	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
Ivanov	1
to	1
select	1
some	1
other	1
historical	1
subject	1
fresh	1
untouched	1
But	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
subject	1
presented	1
to	1
art	1
If	1
one	1
looked	1
one	1
would	1
find	1
others	1
But	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
art	1
cannot	1
suffer	1
doubt	1
and	1
discussion	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
Ivanov	1
the	1
question	1
arises	1
for	1
the	1
believer	1
and	1
the	1
unbeliever	1
alike	1
Is	1
it	1
God	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
is	1
destroyed	1
Why	1
so	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
for	1
educated	1
people	1
said	1
Mihailov	1
the	1
question	1
cannot	1
exist	1
Golenishtchev	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
this	1
and	1
confounded	1
Mihailov	1
by	1
his	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
being	1
essential	1
to	1
art	1
Mihailov	1
was	1
greatly	1
perturbed	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
idea	1
Chapter	1
12	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
exchanging	1
glances	1
regretting	1
their	1
friend	1
s	1
flow	1
of	1
cleverness	1
At	1
last	1
Vronsky	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
artist	1
walked	1
away	1
to	1
another	1
small	1
picture	1
Oh	1
how	1
exquisite	1
What	1
a	1
lovely	1
thing	1
A	1
gem	1
How	1
exquisite	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
they	1
re	1
so	1
pleased	1
with	1
thought	1
Mihailov	1
He	1
had	1
positively	1
forgotten	1
that	1
picture	1
he	1
had	1
painted	1
three	1
years	1
ago	1
He	1
had	1
forgotten	1
all	1
the	1
agonies	1
and	1
the	1
ecstasies	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
with	1
that	1
picture	1
when	1
for	1
several	1
months	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
one	1
thought	1
haunting	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
He	1
had	1
forgotten	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
forgot	1
the	1
pictures	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
like	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
expecting	1
an	1
Englishman	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
buy	1
it	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
only	1
an	1
old	1
study	1
he	1
said	1
How	1
fine	1
said	1
Golenishtchev	1
he	1
too	1
with	1
unmistakable	1
sincerity	1
falling	1
under	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
Two	1
boys	1
were	1
angling	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
willow	1
tree	1
The	1
elder	1
had	1
just	1
dropped	1
in	1
the	1
hook	1
and	1
was	1
carefully	1
pulling	1
the	1
float	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
bush	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
The	1
other	1
a	1
little	1
younger	1
was	1
lying	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbows	1
with	1
his	1
tangled	1
flaxen	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
his	1
dreamy	1
blue	1
eyes	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
thinking	1
of	1
The	1
enthusiasm	1
over	1
this	1
picture	1
stirred	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
feeling	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
Mihailov	1
but	1
he	1
feared	1
and	1
disliked	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
feeling	1
for	1
things	1
past	1
and	1
so	1
even	1
though	1
this	1
praise	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
visitors	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
third	1
picture	1
But	1
Vronsky	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
picture	1
was	1
for	1
sale	1
To	1
Mihailov	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
excited	1
by	1
visitors	1
it	1
was	1
extremely	1
distasteful	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
money	1
matters	1
It	1
is	1
put	1
up	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
sold	1
he	1
answered	1
scowling	1
gloomily	1
When	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
gone	1
Mihailov	1
sat	1
down	1
opposite	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
Pilate	1
and	1
Christ	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
went	1
over	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
and	1
what	1
though	1
not	1
said	1
had	1
been	1
implied	1
by	1
those	1
visitors	1
And	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
had	1
had	1
such	1
weight	1
with	1
him	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
there	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
mentally	1
put	1
himself	1
at	1
their	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
suddenly	1
lost	1
all	1
importance	1
for	1
him	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
picture	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
own	1
full	1
artist	1
vision	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
in	1
that	1
mood	1
of	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
perfectibility	1
and	1
so	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
a	1
conviction	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
intense	1
fervor	1
excluding	1
all	1
other	1
interests	1
in	1
which	1
alone	1
he	1
could	1
work	1
Christ	1
s	1
foreshortened	1
leg	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
though	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
palette	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
work	1
As	1
he	1
corrected	1
the	1
leg	1
he	1
looked	1
continually	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
John	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
which	1
his	1
visitors	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
noticed	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
beyond	1
perfection	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
leg	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
touch	1
that	1
figure	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
too	1
much	1
excited	1
for	1
it	1
He	1
was	1
equally	1
unable	1
to	1
work	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
affected	1
and	1
saw	1
everything	1
too	1
much	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
transition	1
from	1
coldness	1
to	1
inspiration	1
at	1
which	1
work	1
was	1
possible	1
Today	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
agitated	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
covered	1
the	1
picture	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
holding	1
the	1
cloth	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
smiling	1
blissfully	1
gazed	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
John	1
At	1
last	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
regretfully	1
tearing	1
himself	1
away	1
he	1
dropped	1
the	1
cloth	1
and	1
exhausted	1
but	1
happy	1
went	1
home	1
Vronsky	1
Anna	1
and	1
Golenishtchev	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
home	1
were	1
particularly	1
lively	1
and	1
cheerful	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
Mihailov	1
and	1
his	1
pictures	1
The	1
word	1
talent	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
meant	1
an	1
inborn	1
almost	1
physical	1
aptitude	1
apart	1
from	1
brain	1
and	1
heart	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
expression	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
gained	1
from	1
life	1
recurred	1
particularly	1
often	1
in	1
their	1
talk	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
necessary	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
sum	1
up	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
though	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
They	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
denying	1
his	1
talent	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
talent	1
could	1
not	1
develop	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
education	1
the	1
common	1
defect	1
of	1
our	1
Russian	1
artists	1
But	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
had	1
imprinted	1
itself	1
on	1
their	1
memories	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
continually	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
it	1
What	1
an	1
exquisite	1
thing	1
How	1
he	1
has	1
succeeded	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
how	1
simply	1
He	1
doesn	1
t	1
even	1
comprehend	1
how	1
good	1
it	1
is	1
Yes	1
I	1
mustn	1
t	1
let	1
it	1
slip	1
I	1
must	1
buy	1
it	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Chapter	1
13	1
Mihailov	1
sold	1
Vronsky	1
his	1
picture	1
and	1
agreed	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
Anna	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
began	1
the	1
work	1
From	1
the	1
fifth	1
sitting	1
the	1
portrait	1
impressed	1
everyone	1
especially	1
Vronsky	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
its	1
resemblance	1
but	1
by	1
its	1
characteristic	1
beauty	1
It	1
was	1
strange	1
how	1
Mihailov	1
could	1
have	1
discovered	1
just	1
her	1
characteristic	1
beauty	1
One	1
needs	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
love	1
her	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
her	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
very	1
sweetest	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
Vronsky	1
thought	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
this	1
portrait	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
learned	1
this	1
sweetest	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
But	1
the	1
expression	1
was	1
so	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
others	1
too	1
fancied	1
they	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
it	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
struggling	1
on	1
for	1
ever	1
so	1
long	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
portrait	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
just	1
looked	1
and	1
painted	1
it	1
That	1
s	1
where	1
technique	1
comes	1
in	1
That	1
will	1
come	1
was	1
the	1
consoling	1
reassurance	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
Golenishtchev	1
in	1
whose	1
view	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
both	1
talent	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
important	1
culture	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
wider	1
outlook	1
on	1
art	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
faith	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
talent	1
was	1
propped	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
need	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
sympathy	1
and	1
approval	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
articles	1
and	1
ideas	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
praise	1
and	1
support	1
must	1
be	1
mutual	1
In	1
another	1
man	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
palazzo	1
Mihailov	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
man	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
studio	1
He	1
behaved	1
with	1
hostile	1
courtesy	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
coming	1
closer	1
to	1
people	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
respect	1
He	1
called	1
Vronsky	1
your	1
excellency	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
Anna	1
s	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
invitations	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
stay	1
to	1
dinner	1
nor	1
come	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
sittings	1
Anna	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
friendly	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
grateful	1
for	1
her	1
portrait	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
cordial	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
obviously	1
interested	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
artist	1
s	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
picture	1
Golenishtchev	1
never	1
let	1
slip	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
instilling	1
sound	1
ideas	1
about	1
art	1
into	1
Mihailov	1
But	1
Mihailov	1
remained	1
equally	1
chilly	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
Anna	1
was	1
aware	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
avoided	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
talk	1
about	1
his	1
painting	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
stubborn	1
silence	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
stubbornly	1
silent	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
shown	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
picture	1
He	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
bored	1
by	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
conversation	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
oppose	1
him	1
Altogether	1
Mihailov	1
with	1
his	1
reserved	1
and	1
disagreeable	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
hostile	1
attitude	1
was	1
quite	1
disliked	1
by	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
better	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
glad	1
when	1
the	1
sittings	1
were	1
over	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
magnificent	1
portrait	1
in	1
their	1
possession	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
coming	1
Golenishtchev	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
give	1
expression	1
to	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
Mihailov	1
was	1
simply	1
jealous	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
Not	1
envious	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
since	1
he	1
has	1
talent	1
but	1
it	1
annoys	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
wealthy	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
and	1
a	1
count	1
too	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
all	1
detest	1
a	1
title	1
can	1
without	1
any	1
particular	1
trouble	1
do	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
not	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
it	1
And	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
culture	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
without	1
Vronsky	1
defended	1
Mihailov	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
believed	1
it	1
because	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
lower	1
world	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
envious	1
Anna	1
s	1
portrait	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
painted	1
from	1
nature	1
both	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
Mihailov	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
shown	1
Vronsky	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Mihailov	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
it	1
Only	1
after	1
Mihailov	1
s	1
portrait	1
was	1
painted	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
painting	1
his	1
portrait	1
of	1
Anna	1
deciding	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
needed	1
His	1
picture	1
of	1
mediaeval	1
life	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
And	1
he	1
himself	1
and	1
Golenishtchev	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
Anna	1
thought	1
it	1
very	1
good	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
celebrated	1
pictures	1
they	1
knew	1
than	1
Mihailov	1
s	1
picture	1
Mihailov	1
meanwhile	1
although	1
Anna	1
s	1
portrait	1
greatly	1
fascinated	1
him	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
glad	1
than	1
they	1
were	1
when	1
the	1
sittings	1
were	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Golenishtchev	1
s	1
disquisitions	1
upon	1
art	1
and	1
could	1
forget	1
about	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
painting	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevented	1
from	1
amusing	1
himself	1
with	1
painting	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
dilettanti	1
had	1
a	1
perfect	1
right	1
to	1
paint	1
what	1
they	1
liked	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
A	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevented	1
from	1
making	1
himself	1
a	1
big	1
wax	1
doll	1
and	1
kissing	1
it	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
doll	1
and	1
sit	1
before	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
begin	1
caressing	1
his	1
doll	1
as	1
the	1
lover	1
caressed	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
distasteful	1
to	1
the	1
lover	1
Just	1
such	1
a	1
distasteful	1
sensation	1
was	1
what	1
Mihailov	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
painting	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
both	1
ludicrous	1
and	1
irritating	1
both	1
pitiable	1
and	1
offensive	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
interest	1
in	1
painting	1
and	1
the	1
Middle	1
Ages	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long	1
He	1
had	1
enough	1
taste	1
for	1
painting	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
picture	1
The	1
picture	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
He	1
was	1
vaguely	1
aware	1
that	1
its	1
defects	1
inconspicuous	1
at	1
first	1
would	1
be	1
glaring	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
it	1
The	1
same	1
experience	1
befell	1
him	1
as	1
Golenishtchev	1
who	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
continually	1
deceived	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
his	1
idea	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
mature	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
working	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
collecting	1
materials	1
This	1
exasperated	1
and	1
tortured	1
Golenishtchev	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
deceiving	1
and	1
torturing	1
himself	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
incapable	1
of	1
exasperation	1
With	1
his	1
characteristic	1
decision	1
without	1
explanation	1
or	1
apology	1
he	1
simply	1
ceased	1
working	1
at	1
painting	1
But	1
without	1
this	1
occupation	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
of	1
Anna	1
who	1
wondered	1
at	1
his	1
loss	1
of	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
struck	1
them	1
as	1
intolerably	1
tedious	1
in	1
an	1
Italian	1
town	1
The	1
palazzo	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
so	1
obtrusively	1
old	1
and	1
dirty	1
the	1
spots	1
on	1
the	1
curtains	1
the	1
cracks	1
in	1
the	1
floors	1
the	1
broken	1
plaster	1
on	1
the	1
cornices	1
became	1
so	1
disagreeably	1
obvious	1
and	1
the	1
everlasting	1
sameness	1
of	1
Golenishtchev	1
and	1
the	1
Italian	1
professor	1
and	1
the	1
German	1
traveler	1
became	1
so	1
wearisome	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
change	1
They	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Russia	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
Vronsky	1
intended	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
partition	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
while	1
Anna	1
meant	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
The	1
summer	1
they	1
intended	1
to	1
spend	1
on	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
great	1
family	1
estate	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
three	1
months	1
He	1
was	1
happy	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
At	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
former	1
dreams	1
disappointed	1
and	1
new	1
unexpected	1
surprises	1
of	1
happiness	1
He	1
was	1
happy	1
but	1
on	1
entering	1
upon	1
family	1
life	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
imagined	1
At	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
experienced	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
experience	1
who	1
after	1
admiring	1
the	1
smooth	1
happy	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
on	1
a	1
lake	1
should	1
get	1
himself	1
into	1
that	1
little	1
boat	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
sitting	1
still	1
floating	1
smoothly	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
think	1
too	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
forget	1
where	1
one	1
was	1
floating	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
water	1
under	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
row	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
unaccustomed	1
hands	1
would	1
be	1
sore	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
easy	1
but	1
that	1
doing	1
it	1
though	1
very	1
delightful	1
was	1
very	1
difficult	1
As	1
a	1
bachelor	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
married	1
life	1
seen	1
the	1
petty	1
cares	1
the	1
squabbles	1
the	1
jealousy	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
In	1
his	1
future	1
married	1
life	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
even	1
the	1
external	1
forms	1
indeed	1
he	1
fancied	1
must	1
be	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
everything	1
And	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
being	1
made	1
on	1
an	1
individual	1
pattern	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
entirely	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
pettiest	1
details	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
despised	1
before	1
but	1
which	1
now	1
by	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
had	1
gained	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
importance	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
contend	1
against	1
And	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
details	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
easy	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fancied	1
before	1
Although	1
Levin	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
most	1
exact	1
conceptions	1
of	1
domestic	1
life	1
unconsciously	1
like	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
pictured	1
domestic	1
life	1
as	1
the	1
happiest	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
love	1
with	1
nothing	1
to	1
hinder	1
and	1
no	1
petty	1
cares	1
to	1
distract	1
He	1
ought	1
as	1
he	1
conceived	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
repose	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
love	1
She	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
beloved	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
But	1
like	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
forgot	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
would	1
want	1
work	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
she	1
his	1
poetic	1
exquisite	1
Kitty	1
could	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
weeks	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
think	1
remember	1
and	1
busy	1
herself	1
about	1
tablecloths	1
and	1
furniture	1
about	1
mattresses	1
for	1
visitors	1
about	1
a	1
tray	1
about	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
the	1
dinner	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
engaged	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
definiteness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
declined	1
the	1
tour	1
abroad	1
and	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
something	1
she	1
wanted	1
and	1
could	1
still	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
outside	1
her	1
love	1
This	1
had	1
jarred	1
upon	1
him	1
then	1
and	1
now	1
her	1
trivial	1
cares	1
and	1
anxieties	1
jarred	1
upon	1
him	1
several	1
times	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
essential	1
for	1
her	1
And	1
loving	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
jeered	1
at	1
these	1
domestic	1
pursuits	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
admiring	1
them	1
He	1
jeered	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
arranged	1
the	1
furniture	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
Moscow	1
rearranged	1
their	1
room	1
hung	1
up	1
curtains	1
prepared	1
rooms	1
for	1
visitors	1
a	1
room	1
for	1
Dolly	1
saw	1
after	1
an	1
abode	1
for	1
her	1
new	1
maid	1
ordered	1
dinner	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
cook	1
came	1
into	1
collision	1
with	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
taking	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
stores	1
He	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
old	1
cook	1
smiled	1
admiring	1
her	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
inexperienced	1
impossible	1
orders	1
how	1
mournfully	1
and	1
tenderly	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
the	1
young	1
mistress	1
s	1
new	1
arrangements	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
extraordinarily	1
sweet	1
when	1
laughing	1
and	1
crying	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
maid	1
Masha	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
looking	1
upon	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
so	1
no	1
one	1
obeyed	1
her	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
sweet	1
but	1
strange	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
without	1
this	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
change	1
she	1
was	1
experiencing	1
she	1
who	1
at	1
home	1
had	1
sometimes	1
wanted	1
some	1
favorite	1
dish	1
or	1
sweets	1
without	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
getting	1
either	1
now	1
could	1
order	1
what	1
she	1
liked	1
buy	1
pounds	1
of	1
sweets	1
spend	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
she	1
liked	1
and	1
order	1
any	1
puddings	1
she	1
pleased	1
She	1
was	1
dreaming	1
with	1
delight	1
now	1
of	1
Dolly	1
s	1
coming	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
especially	1
because	1
she	1
would	1
order	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
their	1
favorite	1
puddings	1
and	1
Dolly	1
would	1
appreciate	1
all	1
her	1
new	1
housekeeping	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
herself	1
why	1
and	1
wherefore	1
but	1
the	1
arranging	1
of	1
her	1
house	1
had	1
an	1
irresistible	1
attraction	1
for	1
her	1
Instinctively	1
feeling	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
spring	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
days	1
of	1
rough	1
weather	1
too	1
she	1
built	1
her	1
nest	1
as	1
best	1
she	1
could	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
haste	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
build	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
This	1
care	1
for	1
domestic	1
details	1
in	1
Kitty	1
so	1
opposed	1
to	1
Levin	1
s	1
ideal	1
of	1
exalted	1
happiness	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
disappointments	1
and	1
this	1
sweet	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
household	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
loving	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
happy	1
surprises	1
Another	1
disappointment	1
and	1
happy	1
surprise	1
came	1
in	1
their	1
quarrels	1
Levin	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
conceived	1
that	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
any	1
relations	1
could	1
arise	1
other	1
than	1
tender	1
respectful	1
and	1
loving	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
early	1
days	1
they	1
quarreled	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
himself	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
and	1
wrung	1
her	1
arms	1
This	1
first	1
quarrel	1
arose	1
from	1
Levin	1
s	1
having	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
farmhouse	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
away	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
too	1
long	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
by	1
a	1
short	1
cut	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
way	1
He	1
drove	1
home	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
and	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
home	1
the	1
warmer	1
was	1
his	1
tenderness	1
for	1
her	1
He	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
with	1
an	1
even	1
stronger	1
feeling	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
house	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
offer	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
lowering	1
expression	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
kissed	1
her	1
she	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
You	1
ve	1
been	1
enjoying	1
yourself	1
she	1
began	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
spiteful	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
reproach	1
of	1
senseless	1
jealousy	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
torturing	1
her	1
during	1
that	1
half	1
hour	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
sitting	1
motionless	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
burst	1
from	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
clearly	1
understood	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
when	1
he	1
led	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
He	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
ended	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
He	1
felt	1
this	1
from	1
the	1
agonizing	1
sensation	1
of	1
division	1
that	1
he	1
experienced	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
He	1
was	1
offended	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
second	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
by	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
himself	1
He	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
when	1
having	1
suddenly	1
received	1
a	1
violent	1
blow	1
from	1
behind	1
he	1
turns	1
round	1
angry	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
avenge	1
himself	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
antagonist	1
and	1
finds	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
himself	1
who	1
has	1
accidentally	1
struck	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
soothe	1
the	1
pain	1
Never	1
afterwards	1
did	1
he	1
feel	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
intensity	1
but	1
this	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
His	1
natural	1
feeling	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
wrong	1
but	1
to	1
prove	1
her	1
wrong	1
would	1
mean	1
irritating	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
rupture	1
greater	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
suffering	1
One	1
habitual	1
feeling	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
blame	1
and	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
Another	1
feeling	1
even	1
stronger	1
impelled	1
him	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
the	1
rupture	1
without	1
letting	1
it	1
grow	1
greater	1
To	1
remain	1
under	1
such	1
undeserved	1
reproach	1
was	1
wretched	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
suffer	1
by	1
justifying	1
himself	1
was	1
worse	1
still	1
Like	1
a	1
man	1
half	1
awake	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
pain	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
tear	1
out	1
to	1
fling	1
away	1
the	1
aching	1
place	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
aching	1
place	1
was	1
himself	1
He	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
try	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
aching	1
place	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
They	1
made	1
peace	1
She	1
recognizing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
wrong	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
so	1
became	1
tenderer	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
experienced	1
new	1
redoubled	1
happiness	1
in	1
their	1
love	1
But	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
such	1
quarrels	1
from	1
happening	1
again	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
often	1
too	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
unexpected	1
and	1
trivial	1
grounds	1
These	1
quarrels	1
frequently	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
early	1
period	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
often	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
When	1
one	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
the	1
peace	1
was	1
not	1
broken	1
but	1
when	1
both	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
an	1
ill	1
humor	1
quarrels	1
sprang	1
up	1
from	1
such	1
incomprehensibly	1
trifling	1
causes	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
remember	1
afterwards	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
quarreled	1
about	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
their	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
redoubled	1
But	1
still	1
this	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
difficult	1
time	1
for	1
them	1
During	1
all	1
this	1
early	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
vivid	1
sense	1
of	1
tension	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
tugging	1
in	1
opposite	1
directions	1
of	1
the	1
chain	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
Altogether	1
their	1
honeymoon	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
month	1
after	1
their	1
wedding	1
from	1
which	1
from	1
tradition	1
Levin	1
expected	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
not	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
sweetness	1
but	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
both	1
as	1
the	1
bitterest	1
and	1
most	1
humiliating	1
period	1
in	1
their	1
lives	1
They	1
both	1
alike	1
tried	1
in	1
later	1
life	1
to	1
blot	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
memories	1
all	1
the	1
monstrous	1
shameful	1
incidents	1
of	1
that	1
morbid	1
period	1
when	1
both	1
were	1
rarely	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
both	1
were	1
rarely	1
quite	1
themselves	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
after	1
their	1
return	1
from	1
Moscow	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
for	1
a	1
month	1
that	1
their	1
life	1
began	1
to	1
go	1
more	1
smoothly	1
Chapter	1

They	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
were	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
writing	1
table	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
writing	1
She	1
wearing	1
the	1
dark	1
lilac	1
dress	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
married	1
life	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
again	1
today	1
a	1
dress	1
particularly	1
remembered	1
and	1
loved	1
by	1
him	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
the	1
same	1
old	1
fashioned	1
leather	1
sofa	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
father	1
s	1
and	1
grandfather	1
s	1
days	1
She	1
was	1
sewing	1
at	1
broderie	1
anglaise	1
He	1
thought	1
and	1
wrote	1
never	1
losing	1
the	1
happy	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
presence	1
His	1
work	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
land	1
system	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
down	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
abandoned	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
formerly	1
these	1
pursuits	1
and	1
ideas	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
petty	1
and	1
trivial	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
overspread	1
all	1
life	1
now	1
they	1
seemed	1
as	1
unimportant	1
and	1
petty	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
suffused	1
with	1
the	1
brilliant	1
light	1
of	1
happiness	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
work	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
gravity	1
of	1
his	1
attention	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
something	1
else	1
and	1
that	1
consequently	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
work	1
quite	1
differently	1
and	1
more	1
clearly	1
Formerly	1
this	1
work	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
life	1
Formerly	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
that	1
without	1
this	1
work	1
his	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
gloomy	1
Now	1
these	1
pursuits	1
were	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
life	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
uniformly	1
bright	1
Taking	1
up	1
his	1
manuscript	1
reading	1
through	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
he	1
found	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
worth	1
his	1
working	1
at	1
Many	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
ideas	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
superfluous	1
and	1
extreme	1
but	1
many	1
blanks	1
became	1
distinct	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
reviewed	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
He	1
was	1
writing	1
now	1
a	1
new	1
chapter	1
on	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
disastrous	1
condition	1
of	1
agriculture	1
in	1
Russia	1
He	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
Russia	1
arises	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
anomalous	1
distribution	1
of	1
landed	1
property	1
and	1
misdirected	1
reforms	1
but	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
contributed	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
to	1
this	1
result	1
was	1
the	1
civilization	1
from	1
without	1
abnormally	1
grafted	1
upon	1
Russia	1
especially	1
facilities	1
of	1
communication	1
as	1
railways	1
leading	1
to	1
centralization	1
in	1
towns	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
luxury	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
development	1
of	1
manufactures	1
credit	1
and	1
its	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
speculation	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
agriculture	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
normal	1
development	1
of	1
wealth	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
all	1
these	1
phenomena	1
would	1
arise	1
only	1
when	1
a	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
labor	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
into	1
agriculture	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
under	1
regular	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
definite	1
conditions	1
that	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
ought	1
to	1
increase	1
proportionally	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
other	1
sources	1
of	1
wealth	1
should	1
not	1
outstrip	1
agriculture	1
that	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
stage	1
of	1
agriculture	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
corresponding	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
unsettled	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
railways	1
called	1
into	1
being	1
by	1
political	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
economic	1
needs	1
were	1
premature	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
promoting	1
agriculture	1
as	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
were	1
competing	1
with	1
agriculture	1
and	1
promoting	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
manufactures	1
and	1
credit	1
and	1
so	1
arresting	1
its	1
progress	1
and	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
sided	1
and	1
premature	1
development	1
of	1
one	1
organ	1
in	1
an	1
animal	1
would	1
hinder	1
its	1
general	1
development	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
development	1
of	1
wealth	1
in	1
Russia	1
credit	1
facilities	1
of	1
communication	1
manufacturing	1
activity	1
indubitably	1
necessary	1
in	1
Europe	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
arisen	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
time	1
had	1
with	1
us	1
only	1
done	1
harm	1
by	1
throwing	1
into	1
the	1
background	1
the	1
chief	1

While	1
he	1
was	1
writing	1
his	1
ideas	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
how	1
unnaturally	1
cordial	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
young	1
Prince	1
Tcharsky	1
who	1
had	1
with	1
great	1
want	1
of	1
tact	1
flirted	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
they	1
left	1
Moscow	1
He	1
s	1
jealous	1
she	1
thought	1
Goodness	1
how	1
sweet	1
and	1
silly	1
he	1
is	1
He	1
s	1
jealous	1
of	1
me	1
If	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
of	1
Piotr	1
the	1
cook	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
red	1
neck	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
possession	1
strange	1
to	1
herself	1
Though	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
will	1
he	1
feel	1
I	1
m	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
d	1
turn	1
round	1
I	1
ll	1
will	1
him	1
to	1
and	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
intensify	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
gaze	1
Yes	1
they	1
draw	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
sap	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
false	1
appearance	1
of	1
prosperity	1
he	1
muttered	1
stopping	1
to	1
write	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
smiling	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
Well	1
he	1
queried	1
smiling	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
she	1
thought	1
It	1
s	1
nothing	1
I	1
wanted	1
you	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
she	1
said	1
watching	1
him	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
vexed	1
at	1
being	1
interrupted	1
or	1
not	1
How	1
happy	1
we	1
are	1
alone	1
together	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
smile	1
of	1
happiness	1
I	1
m	1
just	1
as	1
happy	1
I	1
ll	1
never	1
go	1
anywhere	1
especially	1
not	1
to	1
Moscow	1
And	1
what	1
were	1
you	1
thinking	1
about	1
I	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
No	1
no	1
go	1
along	1
go	1
on	1
writing	1
don	1
t	1
break	1
off	1
she	1
said	1
pursing	1
up	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
cut	1
out	1
these	1
little	1
holes	1
now	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
She	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
scissors	1
and	1
began	1
cutting	1
them	1
out	1
No	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
watching	1
the	1
tiny	1
scissors	1
moving	1
round	1
Oh	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
thinking	1
about	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
Moscow	1
about	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
have	1
such	1
happiness	1
It	1
s	1
unnatural	1
too	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
I	1
feel	1
quite	1
the	1
opposite	1
the	1
better	1
things	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
natural	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
little	1
curl	1
loose	1
he	1
said	1
carefully	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
round	1
A	1
little	1
curl	1
oh	1
yes	1
No	1
no	1
we	1
are	1
busy	1
at	1
our	1
work	1
Work	1
did	1
not	1
progress	1
further	1
and	1
they	1
darted	1
apart	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
culprits	1
when	1
Kouzma	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
tea	1
was	1
ready	1
Have	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
Levin	1
asked	1
Kouzma	1
They	1
ve	1
just	1
come	1
they	1
re	1
unpacking	1
the	1
things	1
Come	1
quickly	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
shall	1
read	1
your	1
letters	1
without	1
you	1
Left	1
alone	1
after	1
putting	1
his	1
manuscripts	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
portfolio	1
bought	1
by	1
her	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
washstand	1
with	1
the	1
elegant	1
fittings	1
that	1
had	1
all	1
made	1
their	1
appearance	1
with	1
her	1
Levin	1
smiled	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
those	1
thoughts	1
a	1
feeling	1
akin	1
to	1
remorse	1
fretted	1
him	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
shameful	1
effeminate	1
Capuan	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
thought	1
It	1
ll	1
soon	1
be	1
three	1
months	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
doing	1
next	1
to	1
nothing	1
Today	1
almost	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
seriously	1
and	1
what	1
happened	1
I	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
begin	1
and	1
throw	1
it	1
aside	1
Even	1
my	1
ordinary	1
pursuits	1
I	1
have	1
almost	1
given	1
up	1
On	1
the	1
land	1
I	1
scarcely	1
walk	1
or	1
drive	1
about	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
things	1
Either	1
I	1
am	1
loath	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
or	1
I	1
see	1
she	1
s	1
dull	1
alone	1
And	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
before	1
marriage	1
life	1
was	1
nothing	1
much	1
somehow	1
didn	1
t	1
count	1
but	1
that	1
after	1
marriage	1
life	1
began	1
in	1
earnest	1
And	1
here	1
almost	1
three	1
months	1
have	1
passed	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
my	1
time	1
so	1
idly	1
and	1
unprofitably	1
No	1
this	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
I	1
must	1
begin	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
her	1
fault	1
She	1
s	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
I	1
ought	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
firmer	1
to	1
maintain	1
my	1
masculine	1
independence	1
of	1
action	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
into	1
such	1
ways	1
and	1
she	1
ll	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
them	1
too	1
Of	1
course	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
anyone	1
who	1
is	1
dissatisfied	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
someone	1
else	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
person	1
nearest	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
his	1
dissatisfaction	1
And	1
it	1
vaguely	1
came	1
into	1
Levin	1
s	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
anything	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
was	1
her	1
education	1
too	1
superficial	1
and	1
frivolous	1
That	1
fool	1
Tcharsky	1
she	1
wanted	1
I	1
know	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
but	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
Yes	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
apart	1
from	1
dress	1
and	1
broderie	1
anglaise	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
serious	1
interests	1
No	1
interest	1
in	1
her	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
estate	1
in	1
the	1
peasants	1
nor	1
in	1
music	1
though	1
she	1
s	1
rather	1
good	1
at	1
it	1
nor	1
in	1
reading	1
She	1
does	1
nothing	1
and	1
is	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
Levin	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
censured	1
this	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
preparing	1
for	1
that	1
period	1
of	1
activity	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
would	1
bear	1
and	1
nurse	1
and	1
bring	1
up	1
children	1
He	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
instinctively	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
terrible	1
toil	1
did	1
not	1
reproach	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
carelessness	1
and	1
happiness	1
in	1
her	1
love	1
that	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
now	1
while	1
gaily	1
building	1
her	1
nest	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
Chapter	1
16	1
When	1
Levin	1
went	1
upstairs	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
sitting	1
near	1
the	1
new	1
silver	1
samovar	1
behind	1
the	1
new	1
tea	1
service	1
and	1
having	1
settled	1
old	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Dolly	1
with	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
continual	1
and	1
frequent	1
correspondence	1
You	1
see	1
your	1
good	1
lady	1
s	1
settled	1
me	1
here	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
sit	1
a	1
bit	1
with	1
her	1
said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
smiling	1
affectionately	1
at	1
Kitty	1
In	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
Levin	1
read	1
the	1
final	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
drama	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
enacted	1
of	1
late	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
Kitty	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
feelings	1
being	1
hurt	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
mistress	1
taking	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
government	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hands	1
Kitty	1
had	1
yet	1
conquered	1
her	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
love	1
her	1
Here	1
I	1
opened	1
your	1
letter	1
too	1
said	1
Kitty	1
handing	1
him	1
an	1
illiterate	1
letter	1
It	1
s	1
from	1
that	1
woman	1
I	1
think	1
your	1
brother	1
s	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
it	1
through	1
This	1
is	1
from	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
from	1
Dolly	1
Fancy	1
Dolly	1
took	1
Tanya	1
and	1
Grisha	1
to	1
a	1
children	1
s	1
ball	1
at	1
the	1
Sarmatskys	1
Tanya	1
was	1
a	1
French	1
marquise	1
But	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
Flushing	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
former	1
mistress	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
letter	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
wrote	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
sent	1
her	1
away	1
for	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
hers	1
and	1
with	1
touching	1
simplicity	1
added	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
want	1
again	1
she	1
asked	1
for	1
nothing	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
was	1
only	1
tormented	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
grief	1
without	1
her	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
begged	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
him	1
Now	1
she	1
wrote	1
quite	1
differently	1
She	1
had	1
found	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
had	1
again	1
made	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
had	1
moved	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
provincial	1
town	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
service	1
But	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
quarreled	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
official	1
and	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
Moscow	1
only	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
so	1
ill	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
doubtful	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
ever	1
leave	1
his	1
bed	1
again	1
she	1
wrote	1
It	1
s	1
always	1
of	1
you	1
he	1
has	1
talked	1
and	1
besides	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
more	1
money	1
left	1
Read	1
this	1
Dolly	1
writes	1
about	1
you	1
Kitty	1
was	1
beginning	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
suddenly	1
noticing	1
the	1
changed	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
face	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
She	1
writes	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Nikolay	1
my	1
brother	1
is	1
at	1
death	1
s	1
door	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
Kitty	1
s	1
face	1
changed	1
at	1
once	1
Thoughts	1
of	1
Tanya	1
as	1
a	1
marquise	1
of	1
Dolly	1
all	1
had	1
vanished	1
When	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
she	1
said	1
Tomorrow	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
can	1
I	1
she	1
said	1
Kitty	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of	1
he	1
said	1
reproachfully	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
offended	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
suggestion	1
unwillingly	1
and	1
with	1
vexation	1
Why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
I	1
go	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
way	1
I	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
because	1
my	1
brother	1
is	1
dying	1
said	1
Levin	1
Why	1
should	1
you	1
Why	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
as	1
you	1
And	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
such	1
gravity	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
only	1
thinks	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
dull	1
by	1
herself	1
thought	1
Levin	1
And	1
this	1
lack	1
of	1
candor	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
such	1
gravity	1
infuriated	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
said	1
sternly	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
quarrel	1
gently	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
cup	1
and	1
withdrew	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
notice	1
her	1
The	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
wounded	1
her	1
especially	1
because	1
he	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
she	1
said	1
hastily	1
and	1
wrathfully	1
Why	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

You	1

Not	1

Don	1

But	1
just	1
think	1
a	1
little	1
this	1

a	1

of	1

that	1
I	1

in	1
a	1

Come	1

go	1
and	1

at	1
Moscow	1
a	1

There	1

me	1
you	1
try	1
on	1
purpose	1
not	1
to	1

No	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
To	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
slave	1
cried	1
Levin	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
anger	1
any	1
longer	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
second	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
beating	1
himself	1
Then	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
marry	1
You	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
free	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
regret	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
running	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
sobbing	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
words	1
not	1
to	1
dissuade	1
but	1
simply	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
heed	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
anything	1
He	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
which	1
resisted	1
him	1
He	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
kissed	1
her	1
hair	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
again	1
still	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
said	1
Kitty	1
she	1
suddenly	1
recovered	1
herself	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
reconciled	1
It	1
was	1
decided	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
together	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
Levin	1
told	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
simply	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
agreed	1
that	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
s	1
being	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
her	1
going	1
improper	1
but	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
dissatisfied	1
both	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
himself	1
He	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
and	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
lately	1
hardly	1
daring	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
such	1
happiness	1
as	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
love	1
him	1
now	1
was	1
unhappy	1
because	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
himself	1
for	1
not	1
showing	1
more	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
Even	1
greater	1
was	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
disagreement	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
not	1
needing	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
horror	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
contingencies	1
they	1
might	1
meet	1
with	1
The	1
mere	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
his	1
Kitty	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
common	1
wench	1
set	1
him	1
shuddering	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing	1

The	1
hotel	1
of	1
the	1
provincial	1
town	1
where	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
was	1
lying	1
ill	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
provincial	1
hotels	1
which	1
are	1
constructed	1
on	1
the	1
newest	1
model	1
of	1
modern	1
improvements	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
intentions	1
of	1
cleanliness	1
comfort	1
and	1
even	1
elegance	1
but	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
that	1
patronizes	1
them	1
are	1
with	1
astounding	1
rapidity	1
transformed	1
into	1
filthy	1
taverns	1
with	1
a	1
pretension	1
of	1
modern	1
improvement	1
that	1
only	1
makes	1
them	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
old	1
fashioned	1
honestly	1
filthy	1
hotels	1
This	1
hotel	1
had	1
already	1
reached	1
that	1
stage	1
and	1
the	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
filthy	1
uniform	1
smoking	1
in	1
the	1
entry	1
supposed	1
to	1
stand	1
for	1
a	1
hall	1
porter	1
and	1
the	1
cast	1
iron	1
slippery	1
dark	1
and	1
disagreeable	1
staircase	1
and	1
the	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
waiter	1
in	1
a	1
filthy	1
frock	1
coat	1
and	1
the	1
common	1
dining	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
dusty	1
bouquet	1
of	1
wax	1
flowers	1
adorning	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
filth	1
dust	1
and	1
disorder	1
everywhere	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
modern	1
up	1
to	1
date	1
self	1
complacent	1
railway	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
this	1
hotel	1
aroused	1
a	1
most	1
painful	1
feeling	1
in	1
Levin	1
after	1
their	1
fresh	1
young	1
life	1
especially	1
because	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
falsity	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
hotel	1
was	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
what	1
awaited	1
them	1
As	1
is	1
invariably	1
the	1
case	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
at	1
what	1
price	1
they	1
wanted	1
rooms	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
decent	1
room	1
for	1
them	1
one	1
decent	1
room	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
inspector	1
of	1
railroads	1
another	1
by	1
a	1
lawyer	1
from	1
Moscow	1
a	1
third	1
by	1
Princess	1
Astafieva	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
There	1
remained	1
only	1
one	1
filthy	1
room	1
next	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
promised	1
that	1
another	1
should	1
be	1
empty	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
Feeling	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
because	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
arrival	1
when	1
his	1
heart	1
throbbed	1
with	1
emotion	1
and	1
anxiety	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
getting	1
on	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
seeing	1
after	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
rushing	1
straight	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Levin	1
conducted	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
assigned	1
them	1
Go	1
do	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
timid	1
and	1
guilty	1
eyes	1
He	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
stumbled	1
over	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
dared	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
Moscow	1
the	1
same	1
woolen	1
gown	1
and	1
bare	1
arms	1
and	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
good	1
naturedly	1
stupid	1
pockmarked	1
face	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
plumper	1
Well	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
Very	1
bad	1
He	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
up	1
He	1
has	1
kept	1
expecting	1
you	1
He	1
Are	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
wife	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
understand	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
confused	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
immediately	1
enlightened	1
him	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
away	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
she	1
brought	1
out	1
Nikolay	1
Dmitrievitch	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
He	1
heard	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
knows	1
your	1
lady	1
and	1
remembers	1
her	1
abroad	1
Levin	1
realized	1
that	1
she	1
meant	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
answer	1
to	1
make	1
Come	1
along	1
come	1
along	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
Kitty	1
peeped	1
out	1
Levin	1
crimsoned	1
both	1
from	1
shame	1
and	1
anger	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
herself	1
and	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
difficult	1
position	1
but	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
crimsoned	1
still	1
more	1
She	1
positively	1
shrank	1
together	1
and	1
flushed	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
clutching	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
apron	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
twisted	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
red	1
fingers	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
Levin	1
saw	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
eager	1
curiosity	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
this	1
awful	1
woman	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
it	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
Well	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
like	1
this	1
Levin	1
said	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
walked	1
jauntily	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
across	1
the	1
corridor	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
his	1
affairs	1
Well	1
then	1
come	1
in	1
said	1
Kitty	1
turning	1
to	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
who	1
had	1
recovered	1
herself	1
but	1
noticing	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
face	1
of	1
dismay	1
or	1
go	1
on	1
go	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
room	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
room	1
He	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
self	1
deception	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
was	1
so	1
frequent	1
with	1
the	1
consumptive	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
during	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
He	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
physical	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
more	1
marked	1
greater	1
weakness	1
greater	1
emaciation	1
but	1
still	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
He	1
had	1
expected	1
himself	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
same	1
distress	1
at	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
horror	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
then	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
himself	1
for	1
this	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
something	1
utterly	1
different	1
In	1
a	1
little	1
dirty	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
painted	1
panels	1
of	1
its	1
walls	1
filthy	1
with	1
spittle	1
and	1
conversation	1
audible	1
through	1
the	1
thin	1
partition	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
in	1
a	1
stifling	1
atmosphere	1
saturated	1
with	1
impurities	1
on	1
a	1
bedstead	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
there	1
lay	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
quilt	1
a	1
body	1
One	1
arm	1
of	1
this	1
body	1
was	1
above	1
the	1
quilt	1
and	1
the	1
wrist	1
huge	1
as	1
a	1
rake	1
handle	1
was	1
attached	1
inconceivably	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
thin	1
long	1
bone	1
of	1
the	1
arm	1
smooth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
The	1
head	1
lay	1
sideways	1
on	1
the	1
pillow	1
Levin	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
scanty	1
locks	1
wet	1
with	1
sweat	1
on	1
the	1
temples	1
and	1
tense	1
transparent	1
looking	1
forehead	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
that	1
fearful	1
body	1
was	1
my	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
thought	1
Levin	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
closer	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
doubt	1
became	1
impossible	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
Levin	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
those	1
eager	1
eyes	1
raised	1
at	1
his	1
approach	1
only	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
faint	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
under	1
the	1
sticky	1
mustache	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
terrible	1
truth	1
that	1
this	1
death	1
like	1
body	1
was	1
his	1
living	1
brother	1
The	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
reproachfully	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
And	1
immediately	1
this	1
glance	1
established	1
a	1
living	1
relationship	1
between	1
living	1
men	1
Levin	1
immediately	1
felt	1
the	1
reproach	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
felt	1
remorse	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
When	1
Konstantin	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
Nikolay	1
smiled	1
The	1
smile	1
was	1
faint	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
smile	1
the	1
stern	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
was	1
unchanged	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
me	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
articulated	1
with	1
effort	1
Yes	1
no	1
said	1
Levin	1
hesitating	1
over	1
his	1
words	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
before	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
wedding	1
I	1
made	1
inquiries	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
talk	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
especially	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
simply	1
stared	1
without	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
evidently	1
penetrated	1
to	1
the	1
inner	1
meaning	1
of	1
each	1
word	1
Levin	1
told	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
Nikolay	1
expressed	1
pleasure	1
but	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
frightening	1
her	1
by	1
his	1
condition	1
A	1
silence	1
followed	1
Suddenly	1
Nikolay	1
stirred	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
Levin	1
expected	1
something	1
of	1
peculiar	1
gravity	1
and	1
importance	1
from	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
Nikolay	1
began	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
health	1
He	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
regretting	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
celebrated	1
Moscow	1
doctor	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
hoped	1
Seizing	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
silence	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
anxious	1
to	1
escape	1
if	1
only	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
from	1
his	1
agonizing	1
emotion	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
his	1
wife	1
Very	1
well	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
her	1
to	1
tidy	1
up	1
here	1
It	1
s	1
dirty	1
and	1
stinking	1
here	1
I	1
expect	1
Marya	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
said	1
with	1
effort	1
Oh	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
ve	1
cleared	1
up	1
go	1
away	1
yourself	1
he	1
added	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
Levin	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
Going	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
He	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
fetch	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
now	1
taking	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
emotion	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
try	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
Why	1
should	1
she	1
suffer	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
suffering	1
he	1
thought	1
Well	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
Kitty	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
face	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
it	1
s	1
awful	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
for	1
said	1
Levin	1
Kitty	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
looking	1
timidly	1
and	1
ruefully	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
then	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
elbow	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
Kostya	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
easier	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
together	1
You	1
only	1
take	1
me	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
him	1
please	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
she	1
said	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
painful	1
There	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
Please	1
let	1
me	1
she	1
besought	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
depended	1
on	1
it	1
Levin	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
agree	1
and	1
regaining	1
his	1
composure	1
and	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
about	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
by	1
now	1
he	1
went	1
again	1
in	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
Kitty	1
Stepping	1
lightly	1
and	1
continually	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
showing	1
him	1
a	1
valorous	1
and	1
sympathetic	1
face	1
Kitty	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sick	1
room	1
and	1
turning	1
without	1
haste	1
noiselessly	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
With	1
inaudible	1
steps	1
she	1
went	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
bedside	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
turn	1
his	1
head	1
she	1
immediately	1
clasped	1
in	1
her	1
fresh	1
young	1
hand	1
the	1
skeleton	1
of	1
his	1
huge	1
hand	1
pressed	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
speaking	1
with	1
that	1
soft	1
eagerness	1
sympathetic	1
and	1
not	1
jarring	1
which	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
women	1
We	1
have	1
met	1
though	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
acquainted	1
at	1
Soden	1
she	1
said	1
You	1
never	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
sister	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
recognized	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
smile	1
at	1
her	1
entrance	1
Yes	1
I	1
should	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
you	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
Not	1
a	1
day	1
has	1
passed	1
that	1
Kostya	1
has	1
not	1
mentioned	1
you	1
and	1
been	1
anxious	1
But	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
interest	1
did	1
not	1
last	1
long	1
Before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
stern	1
reproachful	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
s	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
comfortable	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
fixed	1
stare	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
We	1
must	1
ask	1
about	1
another	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
nearer	1
Chapter	1
18	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
calmly	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
himself	1
be	1
natural	1
and	1
calm	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
attention	1
were	1
unconsciously	1
dimmed	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
distinguish	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
position	1
He	1
smelt	1
the	1
awful	1
odor	1
saw	1
the	1
dirt	1
disorder	1
and	1
miserable	1
condition	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
groans	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
help	1
It	1
never	1
entered	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
analyze	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
situation	1
to	1
consider	1
how	1
that	1
body	1
was	1
lying	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
how	1
those	1
emaciated	1
legs	1
and	1
thighs	1
and	1
spine	1
were	1
lying	1
huddled	1
up	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
more	1
comfortable	1
whether	1
anything	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
make	1
things	1
if	1
not	1
better	1
at	1
least	1
less	1
bad	1
It	1
made	1
his	1
blood	1
run	1
cold	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
details	1
He	1
was	1
absolutely	1
convinced	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
prolong	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
life	1
or	1
to	1
relieve	1
his	1
suffering	1
But	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
regarding	1
all	1
aid	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
and	1
exasperated	1
him	1
And	1
this	1
made	1
it	1
still	1
more	1
painful	1
for	1
Levin	1
To	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
room	1
was	1
agony	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
still	1
worse	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
on	1
various	1
pretexts	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
remain	1
alone	1
But	1
Kitty	1
thought	1
and	1
felt	1
and	1
acted	1
quite	1
differently	1
On	1
seeing	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
she	1
pitied	1
him	1
And	1
pity	1
in	1
her	1
womanly	1
heart	1
did	1
not	1
arouse	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing	1
that	1
it	1
aroused	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
act	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
state	1
and	1
to	1
remedy	1
them	1
And	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
either	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
immediately	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
The	1
very	1
details	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
which	1
reduced	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
terror	1
immediately	1
engaged	1
her	1
attention	1
She	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
chemist	1
s	1
set	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
to	1
sweep	1
and	1
dust	1
and	1
scrub	1
she	1
herself	1
washed	1
up	1
something	1
washed	1
out	1
something	1
else	1
laid	1
something	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
Something	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
directions	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
sick	1
room	1
something	1
else	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
She	1
herself	1
went	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
she	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
got	1
out	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
sheets	1
pillow	1
cases	1
towels	1
and	1
shirts	1
The	1
waiter	1
who	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
engineers	1
dining	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
hall	1
came	1
several	1
times	1
with	1
an	1
irate	1
countenance	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
summons	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
carrying	1
out	1
her	1
orders	1
as	1
she	1
gave	1
them	1
with	1
such	1
gracious	1
insistence	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
evading	1
her	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
patient	1
Above	1
all	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
patient	1
would	1
be	1
angry	1
at	1
it	1
But	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
though	1
he	1
seemed	1
and	1
was	1
indifferent	1
about	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
but	1
only	1
abashed	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
with	1
him	1
Coming	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
whom	1
Kitty	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
Levin	1
on	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
by	1
Kitty	1
s	1
directions	1
they	1
were	1
changing	1
his	1
linen	1
The	1
long	1
white	1
ridge	1
of	1
his	1
spine	1
with	1
the	1
huge	1
prominent	1
shoulder	1
blades	1
and	1
jutting	1
ribs	1
and	1
vertebrae	1
was	1
bare	1
and	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
and	1
the	1
waiter	1
were	1
struggling	1
with	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
shirt	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
the	1
long	1
limp	1
arm	1
into	1
it	1
Kitty	1
hurriedly	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
that	1
way	1
but	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
groaned	1
and	1
she	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
towards	1
him	1
Make	1
haste	1
she	1
said	1
Oh	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
come	1
said	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
angrily	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
my	1
myself	1
What	1
say	1
queried	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
But	1
Kitty	1
heard	1
and	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
and	1
uncomfortable	1
at	1
being	1
naked	1
before	1
her	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
looking	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
looking	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
the	1
arm	1
in	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
you	1
come	1
this	1
side	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
she	1
added	1
Please	1

for	1
me	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
little	1
bottle	1
in	1
my	1
small	1
bag	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
pocket	1
bring	1
it	1
please	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
they	1
ll	1
finish	1
clearing	1
up	1
here	1
Returning	1
with	1
the	1
bottle	1
Levin	1
found	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
settled	1
comfortably	1
and	1
everything	1
about	1
him	1
completely	1
changed	1
The	1
heavy	1
smell	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
aromatic	1
vinegar	1
which	1
Kitty	1
with	1
pouting	1
lips	1
and	1
puffed	1
out	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
was	1
squirting	1
through	1
a	1
little	1
pipe	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
dust	1
visible	1
anywhere	1
a	1
rug	1
was	1
laid	1
by	1
the	1
bedside	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
stood	1
medicine	1
bottles	1
and	1
decanters	1
tidily	1
arranged	1
and	1
the	1
linen	1
needed	1
was	1
folded	1
up	1
there	1
and	1
Kitty	1
s	1
broderie	1
anglaise	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
by	1
the	1
patient	1
s	1
bed	1
there	1
were	1
candles	1
and	1
drink	1
and	1
powders	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
himself	1
washed	1
and	1
combed	1
lay	1
in	1
clean	1
sheets	1
on	1
high	1
raised	1
pillows	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
night	1
shirt	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
collar	1
about	1
his	1
astoundingly	1
thin	1
neck	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
expression	1
of	1
hope	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
at	1
Kitty	1
The	1
doctor	1
brought	1
by	1
Levin	1
and	1
found	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
attending	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
as	1
the	1
patient	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
him	1
The	1
new	1
doctor	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
stethoscope	1
and	1
sounded	1
the	1
patient	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
prescribed	1
medicine	1
and	1
with	1
extreme	1
minuteness	1
explained	1
first	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
medicine	1
and	1
then	1
what	1
diet	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
to	1
He	1
advised	1
eggs	1
raw	1
or	1
hardly	1
cooked	1
and	1
seltzer	1
water	1
with	1
warm	1
milk	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
temperature	1
When	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
which	1
Levin	1
could	1
distinguish	1
only	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
Your	1
Katya	1
By	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
praising	1
her	1
He	1
called	1
indeed	1
to	1
Katya	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
I	1
m	1
much	1
better	1
already	1
he	1
said	1
Why	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
got	1
well	1
long	1
ago	1
How	1
nice	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
towards	1
his	1
lips	1
but	1
as	1
though	1
afraid	1
she	1
would	1
dislike	1
it	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
and	1
only	1
stroked	1
it	1
Kitty	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
hers	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
Now	1
turn	1
me	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
he	1
said	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
Kitty	1
she	1
alone	1
understood	1
She	1
understood	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
mentally	1
keeping	1
watch	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
always	1
sleeps	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
Turn	1
him	1
over	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
disagreeable	1
calling	1
the	1
servants	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
Can	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
not	1
answered	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
Terrible	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
Levin	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
that	1
terrible	1
body	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
quilt	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
preferred	1
to	1
know	1
nothing	1
under	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
influence	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
resolute	1
face	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
into	1
the	1
bed	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
strength	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
heaviness	1
of	1
those	1
powerless	1
limbs	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
him	1
over	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
huge	1
emaciated	1
arm	1
about	1
his	1
neck	1
Kitty	1
swiftly	1
and	1
noiselessly	1
turned	1
the	1
pillow	1
beat	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
head	1
smoothing	1
back	1
his	1
hair	1
which	1
was	1
sticking	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
moist	1
brow	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
kept	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
was	1
pulling	1
it	1
somewhere	1
Levin	1
yielded	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart	1
yes	1
he	1
drew	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
Levin	1
shaking	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
articulate	1
a	1
word	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Chapter	1
19	1
Thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes	1
So	1
Levin	1
thought	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
evening	1
Levin	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
text	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
consider	1
himself	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
intellect	1
than	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
knowing	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
He	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
the	1
brains	1
of	1
many	1
great	1
men	1
whose	1
thoughts	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
had	1
brooded	1
over	1
death	1
and	1
yet	1
knew	1
not	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
knew	1
about	1
it	1
Different	1
as	1
those	1
two	1
women	1
were	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
and	1
Katya	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
had	1
called	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
Levin	1
particularly	1
liked	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
quite	1
alike	1
in	1
this	1
Both	1
knew	1
without	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
doubt	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
life	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
death	1
and	1
though	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
have	1
answered	1
and	1
would	1
even	1
not	1
have	1
understood	1
the	1
questions	1
that	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
Levin	1
both	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
this	1
event	1
and	1
were	1
precisely	1
alike	1
in	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
which	1
they	1
shared	1
with	1
millions	1
of	1
people	1
The	1
proof	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
for	1
a	1
certainty	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
death	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
without	1
a	1
second	1
of	1
hesitation	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
frightened	1
of	1
them	1
Levin	1
and	1
other	1
men	1
like	1
him	1
though	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
death	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
this	1
since	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
were	1
absolutely	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
people	1
were	1
dying	1
If	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
terror	1
and	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
terror	1
waited	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
what	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
More	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
to	1
look	1
how	1
to	1
move	1
To	1
talk	1
of	1
outside	1
things	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
shocking	1
impossible	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
depressing	1
subjects	1
also	1
impossible	1
To	1
be	1
silent	1
also	1
impossible	1
If	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
I	1
am	1
studying	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
if	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
ll	1
think	1
I	1
m	1
thinking	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
If	1
I	1
walk	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
vexed	1
to	1
tread	1
firmly	1
I	1
m	1
ashamed	1
Kitty	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
herself	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
something	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
herself	1
even	1
and	1
about	1
her	1
wedding	1
and	1
smiled	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
petted	1
him	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
cases	1
of	1
recovery	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
so	1
then	1
she	1
must	1
know	1
The	1
proof	1
that	1
her	1
behavior	1
and	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
was	1
not	1
instinctive	1
animal	1
irrational	1
was	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
physical	1
treatment	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
suffering	1
both	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
and	1
Kitty	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
something	1
else	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
the	1
physical	1
treatment	1
and	1
something	1
which	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
physical	1
conditions	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
just	1
dead	1
had	1
said	1
Well	1
thank	1
God	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
sacrament	1
and	1
received	1
absolution	1
God	1
grant	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
death	1
Katya	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
besides	1
all	1
her	1
care	1
about	1
linen	1
bedsores	1
drink	1
found	1
time	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
day	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
the	1
sacrament	1
and	1
receiving	1
absolution	1
On	1
getting	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
sick	1
room	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
two	1
rooms	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
Levin	1
sat	1
with	1
hanging	1
head	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
Not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
supper	1
of	1
preparing	1
for	1
bed	1
of	1
considering	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
talk	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
Kitty	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
more	1
active	1
than	1
usual	1
She	1
was	1
even	1
livelier	1
than	1
usual	1
She	1
ordered	1
supper	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
herself	1
unpacked	1
their	1
things	1
and	1
herself	1
helped	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
beds	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
forget	1
to	1
sprinkle	1
them	1
with	1
Persian	1
powder	1
She	1
showed	1
that	1
alertness	1
that	1
swiftness	1
of	1
reflection	1
which	1
comes	1
out	1
in	1
men	1
before	1
a	1
battle	1
in	1
conflict	1
in	1
the	1
dangerous	1
and	1
decisive	1
moments	1
of	1
life	1
those	1
moments	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
shows	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
value	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
past	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
wasted	1
but	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
preparation	1
for	1
these	1
moments	1
Everything	1
went	1
rapidly	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
twelve	1
o	1
clock	1
all	1
their	1
things	1
were	1
arranged	1
cleanly	1
and	1
tidily	1
in	1
her	1
rooms	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
hotel	1
rooms	1
seemed	1
like	1
home	1
the	1
beds	1
were	1
made	1
brushes	1
combs	1
looking	1
glasses	1
were	1
put	1
out	1
table	1
napkins	1
were	1
spread	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
unpardonable	1
to	1
eat	1
to	1
sleep	1
to	1
talk	1
even	1
now	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
every	1
movement	1
he	1
made	1
was	1
unseemly	1
She	1
arranged	1
the	1
brushes	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
shocking	1
in	1
it	1
They	1
could	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
eat	1
however	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
receive	1
extreme	1
unction	1
tomorrow	1
she	1
said	1
sitting	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
before	1
her	1
folding	1
looking	1
glass	1
combing	1
her	1
soft	1
fragrant	1
hair	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
comb	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
it	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
mamma	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
prayers	1
said	1
for	1
recovery	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
can	1
possibly	1
recover	1
said	1
Levin	1
watching	1
a	1
slender	1
tress	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
round	1
little	1
head	1
that	1
was	1
continually	1
hidden	1
when	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
comb	1
through	1
the	1
front	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
doctor	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
couldn	1
t	1
live	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
days	1
But	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
anyway	1
that	1
I	1
persuaded	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
askance	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
through	1
her	1
hair	1
Anything	1
is	1
possible	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
rather	1
sly	1
expression	1
that	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
of	1
religion	1
Since	1
their	1
conversation	1
about	1
religion	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
engaged	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
ever	1
started	1
a	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
she	1
performed	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
church	1
saying	1
her	1
prayers	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
always	1
with	1
the	1
unvarying	1
conviction	1
that	1
this	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
assertion	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
was	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
Christian	1
as	1
she	1
and	1
indeed	1
a	1
far	1
better	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
about	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
absurd	1
masculine	1
freaks	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
about	1
her	1
broderie	1
anglaise	1
that	1
good	1
people	1
patch	1
holes	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
cut	1
them	1
on	1
purpose	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
Yes	1
you	1
see	1
this	1
woman	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
all	1
this	1
said	1
Levin	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
came	1
You	1
are	1
such	1
purity	1
that	1
He	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
kiss	1
it	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
such	1
closeness	1
to	1
death	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
improper	1
he	1
merely	1
squeezed	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
penitent	1
air	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
brightening	1
eyes	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
miserable	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
lifting	1
her	1
hands	1
which	1
hid	1
her	1
cheeks	1
flushing	1
with	1
pleasure	1
twisted	1
her	1
coil	1

she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
Luckily	1
I	1
learned	1
a	1
lot	1
at	1
Soden	1
Surely	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
people	1
there	1
so	1
ill	1
Worse	1
What	1
s	1
so	1
awful	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
how	1
charming	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
a	1
youth	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
then	1
I	1
can	1
quite	1
quite	1
believe	1
it	1
How	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
we	1

at	1

she	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
her	1

and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
Yes	1
might	1
have	1
been	1

said	1
mournfully	1
He	1
s	1
just	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1

whom	1

Chapter	1
20	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
received	1
the	1
sacrament	1
and	1
extreme	1
unction	1
During	1
the	1
ceremony	1
Nikolay	1
Levin	1
prayed	1
fervently	1
His	1
great	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
holy	1
image	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
card	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
colored	1
napkin	1
expressed	1
such	1
passionate	1
prayer	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
awful	1
to	1
Levin	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
passionate	1
prayer	1
and	1
hope	1
would	1
only	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
more	1
bitterly	1
parting	1
from	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
so	1
loved	1
Levin	1
knew	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
unbelief	1
came	1
not	1
from	1
life	1
being	1
easier	1
for	1
him	1
without	1
faith	1
but	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
because	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
the	1
contemporary	1
scientific	1
interpretation	1
of	1
natural	1
phenomena	1
crushed	1
out	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
present	1
return	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
legitimate	1
one	1
brought	1
about	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
intellect	1
but	1
simply	1
a	1
temporary	1
interested	1
return	1
to	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
hope	1
of	1
recovery	1
Levin	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
Kitty	1
had	1
strengthened	1
his	1
hope	1
by	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
marvelous	1
recoveries	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Levin	1
knew	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
agonizingly	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
supplicating	1
hopeful	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
emaciated	1
wrist	1
lifted	1
with	1
difficulty	1
making	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
tense	1
brow	1
and	1
the	1
prominent	1
shoulders	1
and	1
hollow	1
gasping	1
chest	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
consistent	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
praying	1
for	1
During	1
the	1
sacrament	1
Levin	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
He	1
said	1
addressing	1
God	1
If	1
Thou	1
dost	1
exist	1
make	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
recover	1
of	1
course	1
this	1
same	1
thing	1
has	1
been	1
repeated	1
many	1
times	1
and	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
him	1
and	1
me	1
After	1
extreme	1
unction	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
became	1
suddenly	1
much	1
better	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
cough	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
smiled	1
kissed	1
Kitty	1
s	1
hand	1
thanking	1
her	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
comfortable	1
free	1
from	1
pain	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
strong	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
appetite	1
He	1
even	1
raised	1
himself	1
when	1
his	1
soup	1
was	1
brought	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
cutlet	1
as	1
well	1
Hopelessly	1
ill	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
obvious	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recover	1
Levin	1
and	1
Kitty	1
were	1
for	1
that	1
hour	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
happy	1
though	1
fearful	1
of	1
being	1
mistaken	1
Is	1
he	1
better	1
Yes	1
much	1
It	1
s	1
wonderful	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
wonderful	1
in	1
it	1
Anyway	1
he	1
s	1
better	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
smiling	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
This	1
self	1
deception	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
long	1
duration	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
quiet	1
sleep	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
waked	1
up	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
by	1
his	1
cough	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
every	1
hope	1
vanished	1
in	1
those	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
himself	1
The	1
reality	1
of	1
his	1
suffering	1
crushed	1
all	1
hopes	1
in	1
Levin	1
and	1
Kitty	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
himself	1
leaving	1
no	1
doubt	1
no	1
memory	1
even	1
of	1
past	1
hopes	1
Without	1
referring	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
as	1
though	1
ashamed	1
even	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
iodine	1
to	1
inhale	1
in	1
a	1
bottle	1
covered	1
with	1
perforated	1
paper	1
Levin	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
look	1
of	1
passionate	1
hope	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
sacrament	1
was	1
now	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
brother	1
demanding	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
words	1
that	1
inhaling	1
iodine	1
worked	1
wonders	1
Is	1
Katya	1
not	1
here	1
he	1
gasped	1
looking	1
round	1
while	1
Levin	1
reluctantly	1
assented	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
words	1
No	1
so	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
I	1
went	1
through	1
that	1
farce	1
She	1
s	1
so	1
sweet	1
but	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
deceive	1
ourselves	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
squeezing	1
the	1
bottle	1
in	1
his	1
bony	1
hand	1
he	1
began	1
breathing	1
over	1
it	1
At	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Levin	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
drinking	1
tea	1
in	1
their	1
room	1
when	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
ran	1
in	1
to	1
them	1
breathlessly	1
She	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
quivering	1
He	1
is	1
dying	1
she	1
whispered	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
will	1
die	1
this	1
minute	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
ran	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
raised	1
up	1
with	1
one	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
his	1
long	1
back	1
bent	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
hanging	1
low	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
Levin	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
after	1
a	1
silence	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
m	1
setting	1
off	1
Nikolay	1
said	1
with	1
difficulty	1
but	1
with	1
extreme	1
distinctness	1
screwing	1
the	1
words	1
out	1
of	1
himself	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
raise	1
his	1
head	1
but	1
simply	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
upwards	1
without	1
their	1
reaching	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
face	1
Katya	1
go	1
away	1
he	1
added	1
Levin	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
peremptory	1
whisper	1
made	1
her	1
go	1
out	1
I	1
m	1
setting	1
off	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
said	1
Levin	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
Because	1
I	1
m	1
setting	1
off	1
he	1
repeated	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
liking	1
for	1
the	1
phrase	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
end	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
lie	1
down	1
you	1
d	1
be	1
easier	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
soon	1
enough	1
he	1
pronounced	1
slowly	1
when	1
I	1
m	1
dead	1
he	1
said	1
sarcastically	1
wrathfully	1
Well	1
you	1
can	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
Levin	1
laid	1
his	1
brother	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
The	1
dying	1
man	1
lay	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
but	1
the	1
muscles	1
twitched	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
as	1
with	1
one	1
thinking	1
deeply	1
and	1
intensely	1
Levin	1
involuntarily	1
thought	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
efforts	1
to	1
go	1
along	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
calm	1
stern	1
face	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
all	1
was	1
growing	1
clearer	1
and	1
clearer	1
that	1
was	1
still	1
as	1
dark	1
as	1
ever	1
for	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
yes	1
so	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
articulated	1
slowly	1
at	1
intervals	1
Wait	1
a	1
little	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
Right	1
he	1
pronounced	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
reassuringly	1
as	1
though	1
all	1
were	1
solved	1
for	1
him	1
O	1
Lord	1
he	1
murmured	1
and	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
felt	1
his	1
feet	1
They	1
re	1
getting	1
cold	1
she	1
whispered	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
while	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
lay	1
motionless	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
alive	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
sighed	1
Levin	1
by	1
now	1
was	1
exhausted	1
from	1
mental	1
strain	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
with	1
no	1
mental	1
effort	1
could	1
he	1
understand	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
right	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
death	1
itself	1
but	1
with	1
no	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
kept	1
coming	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
next	1
closing	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
s	1
eyes	1
dressing	1
him	1
ordering	1
the	1
coffin	1
And	1
strange	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
felt	1
utterly	1
cold	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
conscious	1
of	1
sorrow	1
nor	1
of	1
loss	1
less	1
still	1
of	1
pity	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
feeling	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
envy	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
had	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
A	1
long	1
time	1
more	1
he	1
sat	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
continually	1
expecting	1
the	1
end	1
But	1
the	1
end	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Kitty	1
appeared	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
stop	1
her	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
stirring	1
Don	1
t	1
go	1
away	1
said	1
Nikolay	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
Levin	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
and	1
angrily	1
waved	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
With	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
sat	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
an	1
hour	1
another	1
hour	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
death	1
at	1
all	1
now	1
He	1
wondered	1
what	1
Kitty	1
was	1
doing	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
whether	1
the	1
doctor	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
He	1
longed	1
for	1
food	1
and	1
for	1
sleep	1
He	1
cautiously	1
drew	1
away	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
feet	1
The	1
feet	1
were	1
cold	1
but	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
breathing	1
Levin	1
tried	1
again	1
to	1
move	1
away	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
but	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
stirred	1
again	1
and	1
said	1
Don	1
t	1
go	1
The	1
dawn	1
came	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
s	1
condition	1
was	1
unchanged	1
Levin	1
stealthily	1
withdrew	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
sleep	1
When	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
instead	1
of	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
death	1
which	1
he	1
expected	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
earlier	1
condition	1
He	1
had	1
begun	1
sitting	1
up	1
again	1
coughing	1
had	1
begun	1
eating	1
again	1
talking	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
death	1
again	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
express	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
recovery	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
irritable	1
and	1
more	1
gloomy	1
than	1
ever	1
No	1
one	1
neither	1
his	1
brother	1
nor	1
Kitty	1
could	1
soothe	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
everyone	1
and	1
said	1
nasty	1
things	1
to	1
everyone	1
reproached	1
everyone	1
for	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
insisted	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
celebrated	1
doctor	1
from	1
Moscow	1
To	1
all	1
inquiries	1
made	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
answer	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
vindictive	1
reproachfulness	1
I	1
m	1
suffering	1
horribly	1
intolerably	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
suffering	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
especially	1
from	1
bedsores	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
now	1
to	1
remedy	1
and	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
angry	1
with	1
everyone	1
about	1
him	1
blaming	1
them	1
for	1
everything	1
and	1
especially	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
doctor	1
from	1
Moscow	1
Kitty	1
tried	1
in	1
every	1
possible	1
way	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
to	1
soothe	1
him	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
vain	1
and	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
exhausted	1
both	1
physically	1
and	1
morally	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
admit	1
it	1
The	1
sense	1
of	1
death	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
evoked	1
in	1
all	1
by	1
his	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
broken	1
up	1
Everyone	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
inevitably	1
die	1
soon	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
half	1
dead	1
already	1
Everyone	1
wished	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
die	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
everyone	1
concealing	1
this	1
gave	1
him	1
medicines	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
remedies	1
and	1
doctors	1
and	1
deceived	1
him	1
and	1
themselves	1
and	1
each	1
other	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
falsehood	1
disgusting	1
irreverent	1
deceit	1
And	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
bent	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
anyone	1
else	1
did	1
Levin	1
was	1
most	1
painfully	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
deceit	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
reconciling	1
his	1
brothers	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
death	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
wrote	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
himself	1
and	1
in	1
touching	1
terms	1
he	1
begged	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
forgiveness	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
said	1
nothing	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
Levin	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
No	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
Nikolay	1
answered	1
vexed	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
Tell	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
a	1
doctor	1
Three	1
more	1
days	1
of	1
agony	1
followed	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
The	1
sense	1
of	1
longing	1
for	1
his	1
death	1
was	1
felt	1
by	1
everyone	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
waiters	1
and	1
the	1
hotel	1
keeper	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
hotel	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
and	1
Levin	1
and	1
Kitty	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
alone	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
this	1
feeling	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
furious	1
at	1
their	1
not	1
getting	1
him	1
doctors	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
taking	1
medicine	1
and	1
talking	1
of	1
life	1
Only	1
at	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
the	1
opium	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
relief	1
from	1
the	1
never	1
ceasing	1
pain	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
half	1
asleep	1
utter	1
what	1
was	1
ever	1
more	1
intense	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
than	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
Oh	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
the	1
end	1
or	1
When	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
over	1
His	1
sufferings	1
steadily	1
growing	1
more	1
intense	1
did	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
prepared	1
him	1
for	1
death	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
pain	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unconscious	1
of	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
limb	1
not	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
ache	1
and	1
cause	1
him	1
agony	1
Even	1
the	1
memories	1
the	1
impressions	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
this	1
body	1
awakened	1
in	1
him	1
now	1
the	1
same	1
aversion	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
itself	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
their	1
remarks	1
his	1
own	1
reminiscences	1
everything	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
agony	1
Those	1
about	1
him	1
felt	1
this	1
and	1
instinctively	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
move	1
freely	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
wishes	1
before	1
him	1
All	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
merged	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
feeling	1
of	1
suffering	1
and	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1
There	1
was	1
evidently	1
coming	1
over	1
him	1
that	1
revulsion	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
look	1
upon	1
death	1
as	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
his	1
desires	1
as	1
happiness	1
Hitherto	1
each	1
individual	1
desire	1
aroused	1
by	1
suffering	1
or	1
privation	1
such	1
as	1
hunger	1
fatigue	1
thirst	1
had	1
been	1
satisfied	1
by	1
some	1
bodily	1
function	1
giving	1
pleasure	1
But	1
now	1
no	1
physical	1
craving	1
or	1
suffering	1
received	1
relief	1
and	1
the	1
effort	1
to	1
relieve	1
them	1
only	1
caused	1
fresh	1
suffering	1
And	1
so	1
all	1
desires	1
were	1
merged	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
rid	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
their	1
source	1
the	1
body	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
words	1
to	1
express	1
this	1
desire	1
of	1
deliverance	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
desires	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
satisfied	1
Turn	1
me	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
he	1
would	1
ask	1
to	1
be	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
as	1
before	1
Give	1
me	1
some	1
broth	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
broth	1
Talk	1
of	1
something	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
silent	1
And	1
directly	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
he	1
would	1
close	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
would	1
show	1
weariness	1
indifference	1
and	1
loathing	1
On	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
from	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
Kitty	1
was	1
unwell	1
She	1
suffered	1
from	1
headache	1
and	1
sickness	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
The	1
doctor	1
opined	1
that	1
the	1
indisposition	1
arose	1
from	1
fatigue	1
and	1
excitement	1
and	1
prescribed	1
rest	1
After	1
dinner	1
however	1
Kitty	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
her	1
work	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sternly	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
unwell	1
That	1
day	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
groaning	1
piteously	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
Worse	1
he	1
articulated	1
with	1
difficulty	1
In	1
pain	1
In	1
pain	1
where	1
Everywhere	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
over	1
today	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
said	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
whose	1
hearing	1
Levin	1
had	1
noticed	1
was	1
very	1
keen	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
Levin	1
said	1
hush	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
Nikolay	1
had	1
heard	1
but	1
these	1
words	1
produced	1
no	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
His	1
eyes	1
had	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
intense	1
reproachful	1
look	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
Levin	1
asked	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
He	1
has	1
begun	1
picking	1
at	1
himself	1
said	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Like	1
this	1
she	1
said	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
woolen	1
skirt	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
indeed	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
patient	1
pulled	1
at	1
himself	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
snatch	1
something	1
away	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
s	1
prediction	1
came	1
true	1
Towards	1
night	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
lift	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
could	1
only	1
gaze	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
intensely	1
concentrated	1
expression	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
Even	1
when	1
his	1
brother	1
or	1
Kitty	1
bent	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
looked	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
Kitty	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
dying	1
While	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
reading	1
it	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
life	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed	1
Levin	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Marya	1
Nikolaevna	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
bedside	1
The	1
priest	1
had	1
not	1
quite	1
finished	1
reading	1
the	1
prayer	1
when	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
stretched	1
sighed	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
The	1
priest	1
on	1
finishing	1
the	1
prayer	1
put	1
the	1
cross	1
to	1
the	1
cold	1
forehead	1
then	1
slowly	1
returned	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
stand	1
and	1
after	1
standing	1
for	1
two	1
minutes	1
more	1
in	1
silence	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
huge	1
bloodless	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
turning	1
cold	1
He	1
is	1
gone	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
moved	1
away	1
but	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
faint	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
mustaches	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
that	1
seemed	1
glued	1
together	1
and	1
quite	1
distinctly	1
in	1
the	1
hush	1
they	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
chest	1
the	1
sharply	1
defined	1
sounds	1
Not	1
quite	1
soon	1
And	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
the	1
face	1
brightened	1
a	1
smile	1
came	1
out	1
under	1
the	1
mustaches	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
round	1
began	1
carefully	1
laying	1
out	1
the	1
corpse	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
death	1
revived	1
in	1
Levin	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
horror	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
insoluble	1
enigma	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
nearness	1
and	1
inevitability	1
of	1
death	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
autumn	1
evening	1
when	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
This	1
feeling	1
was	1
now	1
even	1
stronger	1
than	1
before	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
before	1
did	1
he	1
feel	1
capable	1
of	1
apprehending	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
its	1
inevitability	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
him	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
But	1
now	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
presence	1
that	1
feeling	1
did	1
not	1
reduce	1
him	1
to	1
despair	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
love	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
love	1
saved	1
him	1
from	1
despair	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
love	1
under	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
despair	1
had	1
become	1
still	1
stronger	1
and	1
purer	1
The	1
one	1
mystery	1
of	1
death	1
still	1
unsolved	1
had	1
scarcely	1
passed	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
when	1
another	1
mystery	1
had	1
arisen	1
as	1
insoluble	1
urging	1
him	1
to	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
life	1
The	1
doctor	1
confirmed	1
his	1
suppositions	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Her	1
indisposition	1
was	1
a	1
symptom	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
child	1
Chapter	1
21	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
understood	1
from	1
his	1
interviews	1
with	1
Betsy	1
and	1
with	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
peace	1
without	1
burdening	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
herself	1
desired	1
this	1
he	1
felt	1
so	1
distraught	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
no	1
decision	1
of	1
himself	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
himself	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
now	1
and	1
putting	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
so	1
pleased	1
to	1
interest	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
affairs	1
he	1
met	1
everything	1
with	1
unqualified	1
assent	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
Anna	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
whether	1
she	1
should	1
dine	1
with	1
him	1
or	1
separately	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
clearly	1
comprehended	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
appalled	1
by	1
it	1
Most	1
difficult	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
connect	1
and	1
reconcile	1
his	1
past	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
now	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
past	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
happily	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
troubled	1
him	1
The	1
transition	1
from	1
that	1
past	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
unfaithfulness	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
through	1
miserably	1
already	1
that	1
state	1
was	1
painful	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
If	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
then	1
on	1
declaring	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
unfaithfulness	1
left	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
wounded	1
unhappy	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
hopeless	1
position	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
now	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
reconcile	1
his	1
immediate	1
past	1
his	1
tenderness	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
sick	1
wife	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
s	1
child	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
he	1
now	1
found	1
himself	1
alone	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
a	1
laughing	1
stock	1
needed	1
by	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
despised	1
by	1
everyone	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
departure	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
received	1
applicants	1
for	1
assistance	1
and	1
his	1
chief	1
secretary	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
committee	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
as	1
usual	1
Without	1
giving	1
himself	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
he	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
for	1
those	1
two	1
days	1
simply	1
to	1
preserve	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
indifference	1
Answering	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
s	1
rooms	1
and	1
belongings	1
he	1
had	1
exercised	1
immense	1
self	1
control	1
to	1
appear	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
whose	1
eyes	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
was	1
not	1
unforeseen	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
and	1
he	1
attained	1
his	1
aim	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
detected	1
in	1
him	1
signs	1
of	1
despair	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
departure	1
when	1
Korney	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
bill	1
from	1
a	1
fashionable	1
draper	1
s	1
shop	1
which	1
Anna	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
pay	1
and	1
announced	1
that	1
the	1
clerk	1
from	1
the	1
shop	1
was	1
waiting	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
clerk	1
up	1
Excuse	1
me	1
your	1
excellency	1
for	1
venturing	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
direct	1
us	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
her	1
excellency	1
would	1
you	1
graciously	1
oblige	1
us	1
with	1
her	1
address	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
pondered	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
Letting	1
his	1
head	1
sink	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
several	1
times	1
attempted	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
Korney	1
perceiving	1
his	1
master	1
s	1
emotion	1
asked	1
the	1
clerk	1
to	1
call	1
another	1
time	1
Left	1
alone	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
recognized	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
firmness	1
and	1
composure	1
any	1
longer	1
He	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
was	1
awaiting	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
back	1
and	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
admitted	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
universal	1
contempt	1
and	1
exasperation	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
distinctly	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
of	1
Korney	1
and	1
of	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
during	1
those	1
two	1
days	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
from	1
himself	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
men	1
because	1
that	1
hatred	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
bad	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
but	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
shamefully	1
and	1
repulsively	1
unhappy	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
torn	1
with	1
grief	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
merciless	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
men	1
would	1
crush	1
him	1
as	1
dogs	1
strangle	1
a	1
torn	1
dog	1
yelping	1
with	1
pain	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
security	1
against	1
people	1
was	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
wounds	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
instinctively	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
incapable	1
of	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
unequal	1
struggle	1
His	1
despair	1
was	1
even	1
intensified	1
by	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
sorrow	1
In	1
all	1
Petersburg	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
express	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
who	1
would	1
feel	1
for	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
high	1
official	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
society	1
but	1
simply	1
as	1
a	1
suffering	1
man	1
indeed	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
grew	1
up	1
an	1
orphan	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
brothers	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
their	1
mother	1
died	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
ten	1
years	1
old	1
The	1
property	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
one	1
Their	1
uncle	1
Karenin	1
a	1
government	1
official	1
of	1
high	1
standing	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
a	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Tsar	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
On	1
completing	1
his	1
high	1
school	1
and	1
university	1
courses	1
with	1
medals	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
with	1
his	1
uncle	1
s	1
aid	1
immediately	1
started	1
in	1
a	1
prominent	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
he	1
had	1
devoted	1
himself	1
exclusively	1
to	1
political	1
ambition	1
In	1
the	1
high	1
school	1
and	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
afterwards	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
never	1
formed	1
a	1
close	1
friendship	1
with	1
anyone	1
His	1
brother	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
person	1
nearest	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
Ministry	1
of	1
Foreign	1
Affairs	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
died	1
shortly	1
after	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
marriage	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
governor	1
of	1
a	1
province	1
Anna	1
s	1
aunt	1
a	1
wealthy	1
provincial	1
lady	1
had	1
thrown	1
him	1
middle	1
aged	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
though	1
young	1
for	1
a	1
governor	1
with	1
her	1
niece	1
and	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
putting	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
either	1
to	1
declare	1
himself	1
or	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
town	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
hesitation	1
There	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
as	1
many	1
reasons	1
for	1
the	1
step	1
as	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
overbalancing	1
consideration	1
to	1
outweigh	1
his	1
invariable	1
rule	1
of	1
abstaining	1
when	1
in	1
doubt	1
But	1
Anna	1
s	1
aunt	1
had	1
through	1
a	1
common	1
acquaintance	1
insinuated	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
compromised	1
the	1
girl	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
honor	1
bound	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
He	1
made	1
the	1
offer	1
and	1
concentrated	1
on	1
his	1
betrothed	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
capable	1
The	1
attachment	1
he	1
felt	1
to	1
Anna	1
precluded	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
every	1
need	1
of	1
intimate	1
relations	1
with	1
others	1
And	1
now	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
one	1
friend	1
He	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
so	1
called	1
connections	1
but	1
no	1
friendships	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
invite	1
to	1
dinner	1
to	1
whose	1
sympathy	1
he	1
could	1
appeal	1
in	1
any	1
public	1
affair	1
he	1
was	1
concerned	1
about	1
whose	1
interest	1
he	1
could	1
reckon	1
upon	1
for	1
anyone	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
help	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
candidly	1
discuss	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
business	1
and	1
affairs	1
of	1
state	1
But	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
confined	1
to	1
one	1
clearly	1
defined	1
channel	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
certain	1
routine	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
depart	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
man	1
a	1
comrade	1
of	1
his	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
friends	1
later	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
a	1
personal	1
sorrow	1
but	1
this	1
friend	1
had	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
Department	1
of	1
Education	1
in	1
a	1
remote	1
part	1
of	1
Russia	1
Of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
and	1
most	1
possible	1
were	1
his	1
chief	1
secretary	1
and	1
his	1
doctor	1
Mihail	1
Vassilievitch	1
Sludin	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
was	1
a	1
straightforward	1
intelligent	1
good	1
hearted	1
and	1
conscientious	1
man	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
personal	1
goodwill	1
But	1
their	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
official	1
work	1
together	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
barrier	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
cut	1
off	1
warmer	1
relations	1
After	1
signing	1
the	1
papers	1
brought	1
him	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
silence	1
glancing	1
at	1
Mihail	1
Vassilievitch	1
and	1
several	1
times	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
He	1
had	1
already	1
prepared	1
the	1
phrase	1
You	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
trouble	1
But	1
he	1
ended	1
by	1
saying	1
as	1
usual	1
So	1
you	1
ll	1
get	1
this	1
ready	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
dismissed	1
him	1
The	1
other	1
person	1
was	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
kindly	1
feeling	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
there	1
had	1
long	1
existed	1
a	1
taciturn	1
understanding	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
both	1
were	1
weighed	1
down	1
by	1
work	1
and	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
Of	1
his	1
women	1
friends	1
foremost	1
amongst	1
them	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
never	1
thought	1
All	1
women	1
simply	1
as	1
women	1
were	1
terrible	1
and	1
distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
Chapter	1
22	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
him	1
At	1
the	1
bitterest	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
lonely	1
despair	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
announced	1
walked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
She	1
found	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
J	1
ai	1
forc'e	1

she	1
said	1
walking	1
in	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
and	1
breathing	1
hard	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
rapid	1
exercise	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Dear	1
friend	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
warmly	1
squeezing	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
of	1
hers	1
and	1
gazing	1
with	1
her	1
fine	1
pensive	1
eyes	1
into	1
his	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
frowning	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
disengaging	1
his	1
hand	1
moved	1
her	1
a	1
chair	1
Won	1

he	1
said	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
twitched	1
Dear	1
friend	1
repeated	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
never	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
and	1
suddenly	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
rose	1
at	1
the	1
inner	1
corners	1
describing	1
a	1
triangle	1
on	1
her	1
forehead	1
her	1
ugly	1
yellow	1
face	1
became	1
still	1
uglier	1
but	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
cry	1
And	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
softened	1
he	1
snatched	1
her	1
plump	1
hand	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
kiss	1
it	1
Dear	1
friend	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
breaking	1
with	1
emotion	1
You	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
grief	1
Your	1
sorrow	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
one	1
but	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
find	1
consolation	1
I	1
am	1
crushed	1
I	1
am	1
annihilated	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
man	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
letting	1
go	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
still	1
gazing	1
into	1
her	1
brimming	1
eyes	1
My	1
position	1
is	1
so	1
awful	1
because	1
I	1
can	1
find	1
nowhere	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
within	1
me	1
strength	1
to	1
support	1
me	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
support	1
seek	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
me	1
though	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
friendship	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
Our	1
support	1
is	1
love	1
that	1
love	1
that	1
He	1
has	1
vouchsafed	1
us	1
His	1
burden	1
is	1
light	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
ecstasy	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
support	1
and	1
your	1
succor	1
Although	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
a	1
flavor	1
of	1
that	1
sentimental	1
emotion	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
lofty	1
feelings	1
and	1
that	1
new	1
mystical	1
fervor	1
which	1
had	1
lately	1
gained	1
ground	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
disproportionate	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
this	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
weak	1
I	1
am	1
crushed	1
I	1
foresaw	1
nothing	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
understand	1
nothing	1
Dear	1
friend	1
repeated	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
that	1
pursued	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
grieve	1
for	1
that	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
feeling	1
humiliated	1
before	1
other	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
position	1
I	1
am	1
placed	1
in	1
It	1
is	1
wrong	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
Not	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
performed	1
that	1
noble	1
act	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
at	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
moved	1
to	1
ecstasy	1
and	1
everyone	1
else	1
too	1
but	1
He	1
working	1
within	1
your	1
heart	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
raising	1
her	1
eyes	1
rapturously	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
your	1
act	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
crooking	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
cracked	1
his	1
fingers	1
One	1
must	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
thin	1
voice	1
A	1
man	1
s	1
strength	1
has	1
its	1
limits	1
countess	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
reached	1
my	1
limits	1
The	1
whole	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
arrangements	1
arrangements	1
about	1
household	1
matters	1
arising	1
he	1
emphasized	1
the	1
word	1
arising	1
from	1
my	1
new	1
solitary	1
position	1
The	1
servants	1
the	1
governess	1
the	1
accounts	1
These	1
pinpricks	1
have	1
stabbed	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
At	1
dinner	1
yesterday	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dinner	1
table	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
way	1
my	1
son	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
me	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
but	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
would	1
have	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
bill	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
him	1
but	1
his	1
voice	1
shook	1
and	1
he	1
stopped	1
That	1
bill	1
on	1
blue	1
paper	1
for	1
a	1
hat	1
and	1
ribbons	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
without	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
self	1
pity	1
I	1
understand	1
dear	1
friend	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
Succor	1
and	1
comfort	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
not	1
in	1
me	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
only	1
to	1
aid	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
take	1
from	1
off	1
you	1
all	1
these	1
petty	1
humiliating	1
cares	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
word	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
superintendence	1
is	1
needed	1
You	1
will	1
intrust	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
Silently	1
and	1
gratefully	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
Together	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
Seryozha	1
Practical	1
affairs	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
strong	1
point	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
housekeeper	1
Don	1
t	1
thank	1
me	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
not	1
from	1
myself	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
thanking	1
you	1
But	1
dear	1
friend	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
spoke	1
being	1
ashamed	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
Christian	1
s	1
highest	1
glory	1
he	1
who	1
humbles	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
And	1
you	1
cannot	1
thank	1
me	1
You	1
must	1
thank	1
Him	1
and	1
pray	1
to	1
Him	1
for	1
succor	1
In	1
Him	1
alone	1
we	1
find	1
peace	1
consolation	1
salvation	1
and	1
love	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
heavenwards	1
she	1
began	1
praying	1
as	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
gathered	1
from	1
her	1
silence	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
those	1
expressions	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
not	1
distasteful	1
at	1
least	1
exaggerated	1
now	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
natural	1
and	1
consolatory	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
disliked	1
this	1
new	1
enthusiastic	1
fervor	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
believer	1
who	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
religion	1
primarily	1
in	1
its	1
political	1
aspect	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ventured	1
upon	1
several	1
new	1
interpretations	1
just	1
because	1
it	1
paved	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
discussion	1
and	1
analysis	1
was	1
in	1
principle	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
had	1
hitherto	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
even	1
antagonistic	1
attitude	1
to	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine	1
and	1
with	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
argued	1
but	1
by	1
silence	1
had	1
assiduously	1
parried	1
her	1
attempts	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
into	1
argument	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
words	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
inwardly	1
oppose	1
them	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
both	1
for	1
your	1
deeds	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
words	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
praying	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
once	1
more	1
pressed	1
both	1
her	1
friend	1
s	1
hands	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
enter	1
upon	1
my	1
duties	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
as	1
she	1
wiped	1
away	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
tears	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Seryozha	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
extremity	1
shall	1
I	1
apply	1
to	1
you	1
And	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
went	1
into	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
dropping	1
tears	1
on	1
the	1
scared	1
child	1
s	1
cheeks	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
saint	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
dead	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
kept	1
her	1
promise	1
She	1
did	1
actually	1
take	1
upon	1
herself	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
organization	1
and	1
management	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
household	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
overstated	1
the	1
case	1
when	1
saying	1
that	1
practical	1
affairs	1
were	1
not	1
her	1
strong	1
point	1
All	1
her	1
arrangements	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
modified	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
carried	1
out	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
modified	1
by	1
Korney	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
valet	1
who	1
though	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
now	1
managed	1
Karenin	1
s	1
household	1
and	1
quietly	1
and	1
discreetly	1
reported	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
dressing	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
But	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
help	1
was	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
real	1
she	1
gave	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
moral	1
support	1
in	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
soothing	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
that	1
she	1
almost	1
turned	1
him	1
to	1
Christianity	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
an	1
indifferent	1
and	1
apathetic	1
believer	1
she	1
turned	1
him	1
into	1
an	1
ardent	1
and	1
steadfast	1
adherent	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
interpretation	1
of	1
Christian	1
doctrine	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
gaining	1
ground	1
of	1
late	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
It	1
was	1
easy	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
this	1
teaching	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
like	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
indeed	1
and	1
others	1
who	1
shared	1
their	1
views	1
was	1
completely	1
devoid	1
of	1
vividness	1
of	1
imagination	1
that	1
spiritual	1
faculty	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
conceptions	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
imagination	1
become	1
so	1
vivid	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
other	1
conceptions	1
and	1
with	1
actual	1
fact	1
He	1
saw	1
nothing	1
impossible	1
and	1
inconceivable	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
death	1
though	1
existing	1
for	1
unbelievers	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
judge	1
therefore	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sin	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
experiencing	1
complete	1
salvation	1
here	1
on	1
earth	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
erroneousness	1
and	1
shallowness	1
of	1
this	1
conception	1
of	1
his	1
faith	1
was	1
dimly	1
perceptible	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
idea	1
that	1
his	1
forgiveness	1
was	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
power	1
he	1
had	1
surrendered	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
forgiveness	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
more	1
happiness	1
than	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
every	1
instant	1
that	1
Christ	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
signing	1
official	1
papers	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
His	1
will	1
But	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
necessity	1
to	1
think	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
necessity	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
humiliation	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
elevated	1
standpoint	1
however	1
imaginary	1
from	1
which	1
looked	1
down	1
upon	1
by	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
look	1
down	1
on	1
others	1
that	1
he	1
clung	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
one	1
salvation	1
to	1
his	1
delusion	1
of	1
salvation	1
Chapter	1
23	1
The	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
and	1
sentimental	1
girl	1
been	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
wealthy	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
an	1
extremely	1
good	1
natured	1
jovial	1
and	1
extremely	1
dissipated	1
rake	1
Two	1
months	1
after	1
marriage	1
her	1
husband	1
abandoned	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
impassioned	1
protestations	1
of	1
affection	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
sarcasm	1
and	1
even	1
hostility	1
that	1
people	1
knowing	1
the	1
count	1
s	1
good	1
heart	1
and	1
seeing	1
no	1
defects	1
in	1
the	1
sentimental	1
Lidia	1
were	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
explain	1
Though	1
they	1
were	1
divorced	1
and	1
lived	1
apart	1
yet	1
whenever	1
the	1
husband	1
met	1
the	1
wife	1
he	1
invariably	1
behaved	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
malignant	1
irony	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
incomprehensible	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
long	1
given	1
up	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
given	1
up	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
someone	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
several	1
people	1
at	1
once	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
almost	1
everyone	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
particularly	1
distinguished	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
new	1
princes	1
and	1
princesses	1
who	1
married	1
into	1
the	1
imperial	1
family	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
dignitary	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
a	1
vicar	1
and	1
a	1
parish	1
priest	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
journalist	1
three	1
Slavophiles	1
with	1
Komissarov	1
with	1
a	1
minister	1
a	1
doctor	1
an	1
English	1
missionary	1
and	1
Karenin	1
All	1
these	1
passions	1
constantly	1
waning	1
or	1
growing	1
more	1
ardent	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
most	1
extended	1
and	1
complicated	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
fashionable	1
society	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
after	1
Karenin	1
s	1
trouble	1
she	1
took	1
him	1
under	1
her	1
special	1
protection	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
Karenin	1
s	1
household	1
looking	1
after	1
his	1
welfare	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
attachments	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
genuinely	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Karenin	1
The	1
feeling	1
she	1
now	1
experienced	1
for	1
him	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
stronger	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
feelings	1
Analyzing	1
her	1
feeling	1
and	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
former	1
passions	1
she	1
distinctly	1
perceived	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Komissarov	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
saved	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Ristitch	1
Kudzhitsky	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
Slavonic	1
question	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
Karenin	1
for	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
lofty	1
uncomprehended	1
soul	1
for	1
the	1
sweet	1
to	1
her	1
high	1
notes	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
for	1
his	1
drawling	1
intonation	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
his	1
soft	1
white	1
hands	1
with	1
their	1
swollen	1
veins	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
simply	1
overjoyed	1
at	1
meeting	1
him	1
but	1
she	1
sought	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
she	1
was	1
making	1
on	1
him	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
not	1
by	1
her	1
words	1
only	1
but	1
in	1
her	1
whole	1
person	1
For	1
his	1
sake	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
now	1
lavished	1
more	1
care	1
on	1
her	1
dress	1
than	1
before	1
She	1
caught	1
herself	1
in	1
reveries	1
on	1
what	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
married	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
free	1
She	1
blushed	1
with	1
emotion	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
rapture	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
anything	1
amiable	1
to	1
her	1
For	1
several	1
days	1
now	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
intense	1
excitement	1
She	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
were	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
must	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
seeing	1
her	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
saved	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
torturing	1
knowledge	1
that	1
that	1
awful	1
woman	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
town	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
her	1
any	1
minute	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
made	1
inquiries	1
through	1
her	1
friends	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
those	1
infamous	1
people	1
as	1
she	1
called	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
intended	1
doing	1
and	1
she	1
endeavored	1
so	1
to	1
guide	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
during	1
those	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
across	1
them	1
The	1
young	1
adjutant	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
through	1
whom	1
she	1
obtained	1
her	1
information	1
and	1
who	1
hoped	1
through	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
concession	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
their	1
business	1
and	1
were	1
going	1
away	1
next	1
day	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
calm	1
down	1
when	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
a	1
note	1
was	1
brought	1
her	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
recognized	1
with	1
horror	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
Anna	1
Karenina	1
The	1
envelope	1
was	1
of	1
paper	1
as	1
thick	1
as	1
bark	1
on	1
the	1
oblong	1
yellow	1
paper	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
huge	1
monogram	1
and	1
the	1
letter	1
smelt	1
of	1
agreeable	1
scent	1
Who	1
brought	1
it	1
A	1
commissionaire	1
from	1
the	1
hotel	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
could	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
Her	1
excitement	1
brought	1
on	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
asthma	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
subject	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
recovered	1
her	1
composure	1
she	1
read	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
in	1
French	1
Madame	1
la	1
Comtesse	1
The	1
Christian	1
feelings	1
with	1
which	1
your	1
heart	1
is	1
filled	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
I	1
feel	1
unpardonable	1
boldness	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
miserable	1
at	1
being	1
separated	1
from	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
entreat	1
permission	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
once	1
before	1
my	1
departure	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
recalling	1
myself	1
to	1
your	1
memory	1
I	1
apply	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
simply	1
because	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
cause	1
that	1
generous	1
man	1
to	1
suffer	1
in	1
remembering	1
me	1
Knowing	1
your	1
friendship	1
for	1
him	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
me	1
Could	1
you	1
send	1
Seryozha	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
should	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
some	1
fixed	1
hour	1
or	1
will	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
anticipate	1
a	1
refusal	1
knowing	1
the	1
magnanimity	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
rests	1
You	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
the	1
craving	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
the	1
gratitude	1
your	1
help	1
will	1
arouse	1
in	1
me	1

Everything	1

its	1
contents	1
and	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
magnanimity	1

its	1
free	1

easy	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
tone	1
Say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
and	1
immediately	1
opening	1
her	1
blotting	1
book	1
she	1
wrote	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
that	1
she	1
hoped	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
one	1
o	1
clock	1
at	1
the	1
levee	1
I	1
must	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
grave	1
and	1
painful	1
subject	1
There	1
we	1
will	1
arrange	1
where	1
to	1
meet	1
Best	1
of	1
all	1
at	1
my	1
house	1

I	1
will	1
order	1

He	1
gives	1
the	1

to	1
bear	1
it	1

so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
slight	1
preparation	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
usually	1
wrote	1
some	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
letters	1
a	1
day	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
She	1
enjoyed	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
communication	1
which	1
gave	1
opportunity	1
for	1
a	1
refinement	1
and	1
air	1
of	1
mystery	1
not	1
afforded	1
by	1
their	1
personal	1
interviews	1

People	1

the	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
bowing	1
for	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
to	1
pass	1
Thus	1
people	1
talked	1
incessantly	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
blocking	1
up	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Council	1
he	1
had	1
captured	1
was	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
point	1
by	1
point	1
his	1
new	1
financial	1
project	1
never	1
interrupting	1
his	1
discourse	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
for	1
fear	1
he	1
should	1
escape	1
Almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
left	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bitterest	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
official	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
his	1
upward	1
career	1
comes	1
to	1
a	1
full	1
stop	1
This	1
full	1
stop	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
everyone	1
perceived	1
it	1
but	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
aware	1
that	1
his	1
career	1
was	1
over	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
feud	1
with	1
Stremov	1
or	1
his	1
misfortune	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
or	1
simply	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
reached	1
his	1
destined	1
limits	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
evident	1
to	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
that	1
his	1
career	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
He	1
still	1
filled	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
consequence	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
many	1
commissions	1
and	1
committees	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
day	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
from	1
whom	1
nothing	1
was	1
expected	1
Whatever	1
he	1
said	1
whatever	1
he	1
proposed	1
was	1
heard	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
long	1
familiar	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
needed	1
But	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
being	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
direct	1
participation	1
in	1
governmental	1
activity	1
he	1
saw	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
ever	1
the	1
errors	1
and	1
defects	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
others	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
means	1
for	1
their	1
correction	1
Shortly	1
after	1
his	1
separation	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
began	1
writing	1
his	1
first	1
note	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
judicial	1
procedure	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
endless	1
series	1
of	1
notes	1
he	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
fail	1
to	1
observe	1
his	1
hopeless	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
official	1
world	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
free	1
from	1
anxiety	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
more	1
satisfied	1
than	1
ever	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
activity	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unmarried	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
the	1
Lord	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
his	1
wife	1
says	1
the	1
Apostle	1
Paul	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
guided	1
in	1
every	1
action	1
by	1
Scripture	1
often	1
recalled	1
this	1
text	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
without	1
a	1
wife	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
these	1
very	1
projects	1
of	1
reform	1
been	1
serving	1
the	1
Lord	1
more	1
zealously	1
than	1
before	1
The	1
unmistakable	1
impatience	1
of	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
his	1
exposition	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
seizing	1
his	1
chance	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
was	1
passing	1
slipped	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
Left	1
alone	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
down	1
collecting	1
his	1
thoughts	1
then	1
looked	1
casually	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
where	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
meet	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
And	1
how	1
strong	1
they	1
all	1
are	1
how	1
sound	1
physically	1
thought	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
powerfully	1
built	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
with	1
his	1
well	1
combed	1
perfumed	1
whiskers	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
pinched	1
by	1
his	1
tight	1
uniform	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
pass	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
Truly	1
is	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
evil	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
another	1
sidelong	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
Moving	1
forward	1
deliberately	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
bowed	1
with	1
his	1
customary	1
air	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
dignity	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
Ah	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
malicious	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Karenin	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
was	1
nodding	1
with	1
a	1
frigid	1
gesture	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
congratulated	1
you	1
yet	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
newly	1
received	1
ribbon	1
Thank	1
you	1
answered	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
What	1
an	1
exquisite	1
day	1
today	1
he	1
added	1
laying	1
emphasis	1
in	1
his	1
peculiar	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
exquisite	1
That	1
they	1
laughed	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
anything	1
but	1
hostility	1
from	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
by	1
now	1
Catching	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
yellow	1
shoulders	1
of	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
jutting	1
out	1
above	1
her	1
corset	1
and	1
her	1
fine	1
pensive	1
eyes	1
bidding	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
smiled	1
revealing	1
untarnished	1
white	1
teeth	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
her	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
dress	1
had	1
cost	1
her	1
great	1
pains	1
as	1
indeed	1
all	1
her	1
dresses	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
late	1
Her	1
aim	1
in	1
dress	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
pursued	1
thirty	1
years	1
before	1
Then	1
her	1
desire	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
adorn	1
herself	1
with	1
something	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
adorned	1
the	1
better	1
Now	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
was	1
perforce	1
decked	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
so	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
her	1
figure	1
that	1
her	1
one	1
anxiety	1
was	1
to	1
contrive	1
that	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
these	1
adornments	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
exterior	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
appalling	1
And	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
concerned	1
she	1
succeeded	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
attractive	1
For	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
island	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
goodwill	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
of	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
hostility	1
and	1
jeering	1
that	1
surrounded	1
him	1
Passing	1
through	1
rows	1
of	1
ironical	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
drawn	1
as	1
naturally	1
to	1
her	1
loving	1
glance	1
as	1
a	1
plant	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
ribbon	1
Suppressing	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
joy	1
to	1
him	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
chief	1
sources	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
though	1
he	1
never	1
admitted	1
it	1
How	1
is	1
our	1
angel	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
meaning	1
Seryozha	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
pleased	1
with	1
him	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
And	1
Sitnikov	1
is	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
him	1
Sitnikov	1
was	1
the	1
tutor	1
to	1
whom	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
secular	1
education	1
had	1
been	1
intrusted	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned	1
to	1
you	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
coldness	1
in	1
him	1
towards	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
questions	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
every	1
child	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
began	1
expounding	1
his	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
sole	1
question	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
besides	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
When	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
help	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
back	1
anew	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
activity	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
undertake	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
left	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
Having	1
never	1
before	1
taken	1
any	1
interest	1
in	1
educational	1
questions	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
devoted	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
theoretical	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
After	1
reading	1
several	1
books	1
on	1
anthropology	1
education	1
and	1
didactics	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
education	1
and	1
engaging	1
the	1
best	1
tutor	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
superintend	1
it	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
subject	1
continually	1
absorbed	1
him	1
Yes	1
but	1
the	1
heart	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
him	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
heart	1
a	1
child	1
cannot	1
go	1
far	1
wrong	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
with	1
enthusiasm	1
Yes	1
perhaps	1
As	1
for	1
me	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
You	1
re	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
subject	1
painful	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
anything	1
to	1
have	1
spared	1
you	1
certain	1
memories	1
but	1
others	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
her	1
She	1
is	1
here	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
but	1
immediately	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
deathlike	1
rigidity	1
which	1
expressed	1
utter	1
helplessness	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
I	1
was	1
expecting	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
ecstatically	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
rapture	1
at	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
Chapter	1
25	1
When	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
snug	1
little	1
boudoir	1
decorated	1
with	1
old	1
china	1
and	1
hung	1
with	1
portraits	1
the	1
lady	1
herself	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
She	1
was	1
changing	1
her	1
dress	1
A	1
cloth	1
was	1
laid	1
on	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
stood	1
a	1
china	1
tea	1
service	1
and	1
a	1
silver	1
spirit	1
lamp	1
and	1
tea	1
kettle	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
idly	1
about	1
at	1
the	1
endless	1
familiar	1
portraits	1
which	1
adorned	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
opened	1
a	1
New	1
Testament	1
lying	1
upon	1
it	1
The	1
rustle	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
s	1
silk	1
skirt	1
drew	1
his	1
attention	1
off	1
Well	1
now	1
we	1
can	1
sit	1
quietly	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
slipping	1
hurriedly	1
with	1
an	1
agitated	1
smile	1
between	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
talk	1
over	1
our	1
tea	1
After	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
preparation	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
breathing	1
hard	1
and	1
flushing	1
crimson	1
gave	1
into	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
hands	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
After	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
in	1
silence	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
refuse	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
timidly	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
Dear	1
friend	1
you	1
never	1
see	1
evil	1
in	1
anyone	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
evil	1
But	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
His	1
face	1
showed	1
irresolution	1
and	1
a	1
seeking	1
for	1
counsel	1
support	1
and	1
guidance	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
No	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
interrupted	1
him	1
there	1
are	1
limits	1
to	1
everything	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
immorality	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
quite	1
truthfully	1
since	1
she	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
that	1
which	1
leads	1
women	1
to	1
immorality	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
cruelty	1
to	1
whom	1
to	1
you	1
How	1
can	1
she	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
No	1
the	1
longer	1
one	1
lives	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
learns	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
learning	1
to	1
understand	1
your	1
loftiness	1
and	1
her	1
baseness	1
Who	1
is	1
to	1
throw	1
a	1
stone	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
unmistakably	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
play	1
I	1
have	1
forgiven	1
all	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
cannot	1
deprive	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
exacted	1
by	1
love	1
in	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
But	1
is	1
that	1
love	1
my	1
friend	1
Is	1
it	1
sincere	1
Admitting	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
forgiven	1
that	1
you	1
forgive	1
have	1
we	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
that	1
angel	1
He	1
looks	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
dead	1
He	1
prays	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
beseeches	1
God	1
to	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
her	1
sins	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
so	1
But	1
now	1
what	1
will	1
he	1
think	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
evidently	1
agreeing	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
She	1
was	1
praying	1
If	1
you	1
ask	1
my	1
advice	1
she	1
said	1
having	1
finished	1
her	1
prayer	1
and	1
uncovered	1
her	1
face	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
suffering	1
how	1
this	1
has	1
torn	1
open	1
your	1
wounds	1
But	1
supposing	1
that	1
as	1
always	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
yourself	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
lead	1
to	1
to	1
fresh	1
suffering	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
torture	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
If	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
humanity	1
left	1
in	1
her	1
she	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
it	1
herself	1
No	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
hesitation	1
in	1
saying	1
I	1
advise	1
not	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
intrust	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
And	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
consented	1
and	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
sent	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
in	1
French	1
Dear	1
Madame	1
To	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
results	1
for	1
your	1
son	1
in	1
leading	1
to	1
questions	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
answered	1
without	1
implanting	1
in	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
soul	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
censure	1
towards	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
for	1
him	1
sacred	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
interpret	1
your	1
husband	1
s	1
refusal	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Christian	1
love	1
I	1
pray	1
to	1
Almighty	1
God	1
to	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
you	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
This	1
letter	1
attained	1
the	1
secret	1
object	1
which	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
concealed	1
from	1
herself	1
It	1
wounded	1
Anna	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
For	1
his	1
part	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
on	1
returning	1
home	1
from	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
could	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
concentrate	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
usual	1
pursuits	1
and	1
find	1
that	1
spiritual	1
peace	1
of	1
one	1
saved	1
and	1
believing	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
of	1
late	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
greatly	1
sinned	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
towards	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
saintly	1
as	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
so	1
justly	1
told	1
him	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
troubled	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
drive	1
away	1
harassing	1
recollections	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
mistake	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
now	1
seemed	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
memory	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
her	1
confession	1
of	1
infidelity	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
insisted	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
observance	1
of	1
external	1
decorum	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
sent	1
a	1
challenge	1
tortured	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
remorse	1
He	1
was	1
tortured	1
too	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
her	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
forgiveness	1
which	1
nobody	1
wanted	1
and	1
his	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
man	1
s	1
child	1
made	1
his	1
heart	1
burn	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
remorse	1
And	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
regret	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
reviewed	1
all	1
his	1
past	1
with	1
her	1
recalling	1
the	1
awkward	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
after	1
long	1
wavering	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
But	1
how	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
to	1
blame	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
And	1
this	1
question	1
always	1
excited	1
another	1
question	1
in	1
him	1
whether	1
they	1
felt	1
differently	1
did	1
their	1
loving	1
and	1
marrying	1
differently	1
these	1
Vronskys	1
and	1
Oblonskys	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
with	1
their	1
fine	1
calves	1
And	1
there	1
passed	1
before	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
these	1
mettlesome	1
vigorous	1
self	1
confident	1
men	1
who	1
always	1
and	1
everywhere	1
drew	1
his	1
inquisitive	1
attention	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
dispel	1
these	1
thoughts	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
living	1
for	1
this	1
transient	1
life	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
eternity	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
and	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
this	1
transient	1
trivial	1
life	1
made	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1

But	1
this	1

Alexey	1

the	1

the	1
elevation	1

Well	1
Kapitonitch	1
said	1
Seryozha	1
coming	1
back	1
rosy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
from	1
his	1
walk	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
his	1
birthday	1
and	1
giving	1
his	1
overcoat	1
to	1
the	1
tall	1
old	1
hall	1
porter	1
who	1
smiled	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
person	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
figure	1
Well	1
has	1
the	1
bandaged	1
clerk	1
been	1
here	1
today	1
Did	1
papa	1
see	1
him	1
He	1
saw	1
him	1
The	1
minute	1
the	1
chief	1
secretary	1
came	1
out	1
I	1
announced	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
wink	1
Here	1
I	1
ll	1
take	1
it	1
off	1
Seryozha	1
said	1
the	1
tutor	1
stopping	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1
Take	1
it	1
off	1
yourself	1
But	1
Seryozha	1
though	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
tutor	1
s	1
feeble	1
voice	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
attention	1
to	1
it	1
He	1
stood	1
keeping	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
s	1
belt	1
and	1
gazing	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
Well	1
and	1
did	1
papa	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
for	1
him	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
nodded	1
his	1
head	1
affirmatively	1
The	1
clerk	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
tied	1
up	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
seven	1
times	1
to	1
ask	1
some	1
favor	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
interested	1
both	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
him	1
plaintively	1
beg	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
to	1
announce	1
him	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
had	1
death	1
staring	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
Since	1
then	1
Seryozha	1
having	1
met	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
took	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
him	1
Well	1
was	1
he	1
very	1
glad	1
he	1
asked	1
Glad	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
so	1
Almost	1
dancing	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
And	1
has	1
anything	1
been	1
left	1
asked	1
Seryozha	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
Come	1
sir	1
said	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
shake	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
whispered	1
Something	1
from	1
the	1
countess	1
Seryozha	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
was	1
a	1
present	1
from	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
for	1
his	1
birthday	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
Where	1
Korney	1
took	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
papa	1
A	1
fine	1
plaything	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
too	1
How	1
big	1
Like	1
this	1
Rather	1
small	1
but	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
A	1
book	1
No	1
a	1
thing	1
Run	1
along	1
run	1
along	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
is	1
calling	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
hearing	1
the	1
tutor	1
s	1
steps	1
approaching	1
and	1
carefully	1
taking	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
belt	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
glove	1
half	1
pulled	1
off	1
he	1
signed	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
towards	1
the	1
tutor	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
in	1
a	1
tiny	1
minute	1
answered	1
Seryozha	1
with	1
that	1
gay	1
and	1
loving	1
smile	1
which	1
always	1
won	1
over	1
the	1
conscientious	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
Seryozha	1
was	1
too	1
happy	1
everything	1
was	1
too	1
delightful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
help	1
sharing	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
porter	1
the	1
family	1
good	1
fortune	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
during	1
his	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
gardens	1
from	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
niece	1
This	1
piece	1
of	1
good	1
news	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
particularly	1
important	1
from	1
its	1
coming	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
gladness	1
of	1
the	1
bandaged	1
clerk	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
gladness	1
at	1
toys	1
having	1
come	1
for	1
him	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Seryozha	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
everyone	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
happy	1
You	1
know	1
papa	1
s	1
received	1
the	1
Alexander	1
Nevsky	1
today	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
People	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him	1
And	1
is	1
he	1
glad	1
Glad	1
at	1
the	1
Tsar	1
s	1
gracious	1
favor	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
so	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
proof	1
he	1
s	1
deserved	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
severely	1
and	1
seriously	1
Seryozha	1
fell	1
to	1
dreaming	1
gazing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
porter	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thoroughly	1
studied	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
especially	1
the	1
chin	1
that	1
hung	1
down	1
between	1
the	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
never	1
seen	1
by	1
anyone	1
but	1
Seryozha	1
who	1
saw	1
him	1
only	1
from	1
below	1
Well	1
and	1
has	1
your	1
daughter	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
lately	1
The	1
porter	1
s	1
daughter	1
was	1
a	1
ballet	1
dancer	1
When	1
is	1
she	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
week	1
days	1
They	1
ve	1
their	1
lessons	1
to	1
learn	1
too	1
And	1
you	1
ve	1
your	1
lesson	1
sir	1
run	1
along	1
On	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Seryozha	1
instead	1
of	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
lessons	1
told	1
his	1
tutor	1
of	1
his	1
supposition	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
him	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
machine	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
inquired	1
But	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
learning	1
the	1
grammar	1
lesson	1
for	1
the	1
teacher	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
at	1
two	1
No	1
do	1
just	1
tell	1
me	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
seated	1
at	1
their	1
work	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
what	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
Alexander	1
Nevsky	1
You	1
know	1
papa	1
s	1
received	1
the	1
Alexander	1
Nevsky	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
Vladimir	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
Alexander	1
Nevsky	1
And	1
higher	1
still	1
Well	1
highest	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
the	1
Andrey	1
Pervozvanny	1
And	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
Andrey	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
What	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
and	1
Seryozha	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbows	1
sank	1
into	1
deep	1
meditation	1
His	1
meditations	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
complex	1
and	1
diverse	1
character	1
He	1
imagined	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
having	1
suddenly	1
been	1
presented	1
with	1
both	1
the	1
Vladimir	1
and	1
the	1
Andrey	1
today	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
being	1
much	1
better	1
tempered	1
at	1
his	1
lesson	1
and	1
dreamed	1
how	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
grown	1
up	1
he	1
would	1
himself	1
receive	1
all	1
the	1
orders	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
invent	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
Andrey	1
Directly	1
any	1
higher	1
order	1
were	1
invented	1
he	1
would	1
win	1
it	1
They	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
higher	1
one	1
still	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
immediately	1
win	1
that	1
too	1
The	1
time	1
passed	1
in	1
such	1
meditations	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
teacher	1
came	1
the	1
lesson	1
about	1
the	1
adverbs	1
of	1
place	1
and	1
time	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
action	1
was	1
not	1
ready	1
and	1
the	1
teacher	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
displeased	1
but	1
hurt	1
This	1
touched	1
Seryozha	1
He	1
felt	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
learned	1
the	1
lesson	1
however	1
much	1
he	1
tried	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
teacher	1
was	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
believed	1
him	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
comprehend	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
unable	1
to	1
recollect	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
short	1
and	1
familiar	1
word	1
suddenly	1
is	1
an	1
adverb	1
of	1
manner	1
of	1
action	1
Still	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
disappointed	1
the	1
teacher	1
He	1
chose	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
teacher	1
was	1
looking	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
the	1
book	1
Mihail	1
Ivanitch	1
when	1
is	1
your	1
birthday	1
he	1
asked	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
You	1
d	1
much	1
better	1
be	1
thinking	1
about	1
your	1
work	1
Birthdays	1
are	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
to	1
a	1
rational	1
being	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
day	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
on	1
which	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
one	1
s	1
work	1
Seryozha	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
teacher	1
at	1
his	1
scanty	1
beard	1
at	1
his	1
spectacles	1
which	1
had	1
slipped	1
down	1
below	1
the	1
ridge	1
on	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
so	1
deep	1
a	1
reverie	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
teacher	1
was	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
teacher	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
But	1
why	1
have	1
they	1
all	1
agreed	1
to	1
speak	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
always	1
the	1
dreariest	1
and	1
most	1
useless	1
stuff	1
Why	1
does	1
he	1
keep	1
me	1
off	1
why	1
doesn	1
t	1
he	1
love	1
me	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
mournfully	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
an	1
answer	1
Chapter	1
27	1
After	1
the	1
lesson	1
with	1
the	1
grammar	1
teacher	1
came	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
lesson	1
While	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
Seryozha	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
penknife	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
dreaming	1
Among	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
favorite	1
occupations	1
was	1
searching	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
during	1
his	1
walks	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
death	1
generally	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
death	1
in	1
particular	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
confirmed	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
looking	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
Every	1
woman	1
of	1
full	1
graceful	1
figure	1
with	1
dark	1
hair	1
was	1
his	1
mother	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
such	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
was	1
stirred	1
within	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
breath	1
failed	1
him	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
tiptoe	1
of	1
expectation	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
would	1
lift	1
her	1
veil	1
All	1
her	1
face	1
would	1
be	1
visible	1
she	1
would	1
smile	1
she	1
would	1
hug	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
sniff	1
her	1
fragrance	1
feel	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
cry	1
with	1
happiness	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
evening	1
lain	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
while	1
she	1
tickled	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
laughed	1
and	1
bit	1
her	1
white	1
ring	1
covered	1
fingers	1
Later	1
when	1
he	1
accidentally	1
learned	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
nurse	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
not	1
dead	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
had	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dead	1
to	1
him	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
wicked	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
believe	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
seeking	1
her	1
and	1
expecting	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
That	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
gardens	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
veil	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
believing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
towards	1
them	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
The	1
lady	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
had	1
disappeared	1
somewhere	1
That	1
day	1
more	1
intensely	1
than	1
ever	1
Seryozha	1
felt	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
now	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
forgot	1
everything	1
and	1
cut	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
penknife	1
staring	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
and	1
dreaming	1
of	1
her	1
Here	1
is	1
your	1
papa	1
said	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
rousing	1
him	1
Seryozha	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
intently	1
trying	1
to	1
discover	1
signs	1
of	1
his	1
joy	1
at	1
receiving	1
the	1
Alexander	1
Nevsky	1
Did	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
nice	1
walk	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
easy	1
chair	1
pulling	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Testament	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
opening	1
it	1
Although	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
told	1
Seryozha	1
that	1
every	1
Christian	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
Scripture	1
history	1
thoroughly	1
he	1
often	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
Bible	1
himself	1
during	1
the	1
lesson	1
and	1
Seryozha	1
observed	1
this	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
nice	1
indeed	1
papa	1
said	1
Seryozha	1
sitting	1
sideways	1
on	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
rocking	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
forbidden	1
I	1
saw	1
Nadinka	1
Nadinka	1
was	1
a	1
niece	1
of	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
house	1
She	1
told	1
me	1
you	1
d	1
been	1
given	1
a	1
new	1
star	1
Are	1
you	1
glad	1
papa	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
don	1
t	1
rock	1
your	1
chair	1
please	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
And	1
secondly	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
reward	1
that	1
s	1
precious	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
itself	1
And	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
wished	1
you	1
understood	1
that	1
If	1
you	1
now	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
study	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
win	1
a	1
reward	1
then	1
the	1
work	1
will	1
seem	1
hard	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
work	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sustained	1
by	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
through	1
the	1
wearisome	1
labor	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
consisting	1
of	1
signing	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
eighty	1
papers	1
loving	1
your	1
work	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
it	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
eyes	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
shining	1
with	1
gaiety	1
and	1
tenderness	1
grew	1
dull	1
and	1
dropped	1
before	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
gaze	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
long	1
familiar	1
tone	1
his	1
father	1
always	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
learned	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
it	1
His	1
father	1
always	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
Seryozha	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
addressing	1
some	1
boy	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
imagination	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
boys	1
that	1
exist	1
in	1
books	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
himself	1
And	1
Seryozha	1
always	1
tried	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
act	1
being	1
the	1
story	1
book	1
boy	1
You	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
hope	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
Yes	1
papa	1
answered	1
Seryozha	1
acting	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
boy	1
The	1
lesson	1
consisted	1
of	1
learning	1
by	1
heart	1
several	1
verses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Gospel	1
and	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Testament	1
The	1
verses	1
from	1
the	1
Gospel	1
Seryozha	1
knew	1
fairly	1
well	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
them	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
watching	1
the	1
sharply	1
protruding	1
bony	1
knobbiness	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
forehead	1
that	1
he	1
lost	1
the	1
thread	1
and	1
he	1
transposed	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
one	1
verse	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
another	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
that	1
irritated	1
him	1
He	1
frowned	1
and	1
began	1
explaining	1
what	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
heard	1
many	1
times	1
before	1
and	1
never	1
could	1
remember	1
because	1
he	1
understood	1
it	1
too	1
well	1
just	1
as	1
that	1
suddenly	1
is	1
an	1
adverb	1
of	1
manner	1
of	1
action	1
Seryozha	1
looked	1
with	1
scared	1
eyes	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
whether	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
repeat	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
sometimes	1
did	1
And	1
this	1
thought	1
so	1
alarmed	1
Seryozha	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
understood	1
nothing	1
But	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
repeat	1
it	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
lesson	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Testament	1
Seryozha	1
recounted	1
the	1
events	1
themselves	1
well	1
enough	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
answer	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
certain	1
events	1
prefigured	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
punished	1
over	1
this	1
lesson	1
The	1
passage	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
and	1
began	1
fidgeting	1
and	1
cutting	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
swinging	1
his	1
chair	1
was	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
repeat	1
the	1
patriarchs	1
before	1
the	1
Flood	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
except	1
Enoch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
up	1
alive	1
to	1
heaven	1
Last	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
remembered	1
their	1
names	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
them	1
utterly	1
chiefly	1
because	1
Enoch	1
was	1
the	1
personage	1
he	1
liked	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Testament	1
and	1
Enoch	1
s	1
translation	1
to	1
heaven	1
was	1
connected	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
became	1
absorbed	1
now	1
while	1
he	1
gazed	1
with	1
fascinated	1
eyes	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
watch	1
chain	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
unbuttoned	1
button	1
on	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
In	1
death	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
talked	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
often	1
Seryozha	1
disbelieved	1
entirely	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
those	1
he	1
loved	1
could	1
die	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
die	1
That	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
something	1
utterly	1
inconceivable	1
and	1
impossible	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
die	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
people	1
indeed	1
whom	1
he	1
trusted	1
and	1
they	1
too	1
had	1
confirmed	1
it	1
his	1
old	1
nurse	1
too	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
though	1
reluctantly	1
But	1
Enoch	1
had	1
not	1
died	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
followed	1
that	1
everyone	1
did	1
not	1
die	1
And	1
why	1
cannot	1
anyone	1
else	1
so	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
be	1
taken	1
alive	1
to	1
heaven	1
thought	1
Seryozha	1
Bad	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
those	1
Seryozha	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
they	1
might	1
die	1
but	1
the	1
good	1
might	1
all	1
be	1
like	1
Enoch	1
Well	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
patriarchs	1
Enoch	1
Enos	1
But	1
you	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
already	1
This	1
is	1
bad	1
Seryozha	1
very	1
bad	1
If	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
try	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
necessary	1
than	1
anything	1
for	1
a	1
Christian	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
getting	1
up	1
whatever	1
can	1
interest	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
displeased	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
Piotr	1
Ignatitch	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
of	1
his	1
teachers	1
is	1
displeased	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
punish	1
you	1
His	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
teacher	1
were	1
both	1
displeased	1
with	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
he	1
certainly	1
did	1
learn	1
his	1
lessons	1
very	1
badly	1
But	1
still	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
stupid	1
boy	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
cleverer	1
than	1
the	1
boys	1
his	1
teacher	1
held	1
up	1
as	1
examples	1
to	1
Seryozha	1
In	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
opinion	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
taught	1
In	1
reality	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
that	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
were	1
more	1
binding	1
on	1
him	1
than	1
those	1
claims	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
teacher	1
made	1
upon	1
him	1
Those	1
claims	1
were	1
in	1
opposition	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
direct	1
conflict	1
with	1
his	1
education	1
He	1
was	1
nine	1
years	1
old	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
it	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
guarded	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
eyelid	1
guards	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
love	1
he	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
soul	1
His	1
teachers	1
complained	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
learn	1
while	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
thirst	1
for	1
knowledge	1
And	1
he	1
learned	1
from	1
Kapitonitch	1
from	1
his	1
nurse	1
from	1
Nadinka	1
from	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
but	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
teachers	1
The	1
spring	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
teachers	1
reckoned	1
upon	1
to	1
turn	1
their	1
mill	1
wheels	1
had	1
long	1
dried	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
source	1
but	1
its	1
waters	1
did	1
their	1
work	1
in	1
another	1
channel	1
His	1
father	1
punished	1
Seryozha	1
by	1
not	1
letting	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
Nadinka	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
niece	1
but	1
this	1
punishment	1
turned	1
out	1
happily	1
for	1
Seryozha	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
humor	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
windmills	1
The	1
whole	1
evening	1
passed	1
over	1
this	1
work	1
and	1
in	1
dreaming	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
windmill	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
turn	1
himself	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
sails	1
or	1
tying	1
himself	1
on	1
and	1
whirling	1
round	1
Of	1
his	1
mother	1
Seryozha	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
he	1
suddenly	1
remembered	1
her	1
and	1
prayed	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
tomorrow	1
for	1
his	1
birthday	1
might	1
leave	1
off	1
hiding	1
herself	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
prayed	1
for	1
tonight	1
extra	1
besides	1
the	1
regular	1
things	1
That	1
you	1
might	1
learn	1
your	1
lessons	1
better	1
No	1
Toys	1
No	1
You	1
ll	1
never	1
guess	1
A	1
splendid	1
thing	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
secret	1
When	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
pass	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
Can	1
t	1
you	1
guess	1
No	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
guess	1
You	1
tell	1
me	1
said	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
was	1
rare	1
with	1
him	1
Come	1
lie	1
down	1
I	1
m	1
putting	1
out	1
the	1
candle	1
Without	1
the	1
candle	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
better	1
what	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
prayed	1
for	1
There	1
I	1
was	1
almost	1
telling	1
the	1
secret	1
said	1
Seryozha	1
laughing	1
gaily	1
When	1
the	1
candle	1
was	1
taken	1
away	1
Seryozha	1
heard	1
and	1
felt	1
his	1
mother	1
She	1
stood	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
loving	1
eyes	1
caressed	1
him	1
But	1
then	1
came	1
windmills	1
a	1
knife	1
everything	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
mixed	1
up	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
Chapter	1
28	1
On	1
arriving	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
stayed	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hotels	1
Vronsky	1
apart	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
story	1
Anna	1
above	1
with	1
her	1
child	1
its	1
nurse	1
and	1
her	1
maid	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
suite	1
of	1
four	1
rooms	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
There	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Moscow	1
on	1
business	1
His	1
mother	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
greeted	1
him	1
as	1
usual	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
stay	1
abroad	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
drop	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
Anna	1
His	1
brother	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
see	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
asked	1
him	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Vronsky	1
told	1
him	1
directly	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
as	1
marriage	1
that	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
and	1
until	1
then	1
he	1
considered	1
her	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
their	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
so	1
If	1
the	1
world	1
disapproves	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
relations	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
terms	1
of	1
relationship	1
with	1
me	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
terms	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
The	1
elder	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
a	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
s	1
judgment	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
tell	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
decided	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
Alexey	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
Before	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
before	1
everyone	1
Vronsky	1
addressed	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
formality	1
treating	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
a	1
very	1
intimate	1
friend	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
knew	1
their	1
real	1
relations	1
and	1
they	1
talked	1
about	1
Anna	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
estate	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
social	1
experience	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
laboring	1
under	1
a	1
strange	1
misapprehension	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
understood	1
that	1
society	1
was	1
closed	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
Anna	1
but	1
now	1
some	1
vague	1
ideas	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
brain	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
old	1
fashioned	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
modern	1
progress	1
he	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
become	1
by	1
now	1
a	1
partisan	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
progress	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
society	1
had	1
changed	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
received	1
in	1
society	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
foregone	1
conclusion	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
received	1
at	1
court	1
but	1
intimate	1
friends	1
can	1
and	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
light	1
One	1
may	1
sit	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
at	1
a	1
stretch	1
with	1
one	1
s	1
legs	1
crossed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
if	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
one	1
s	1
changing	1
one	1
s	1
position	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
knows	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
remain	1
sitting	1
so	1
with	1
crossed	1
legs	1
then	1
cramps	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
legs	1
begin	1
to	1
twitch	1
and	1
to	1
strain	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
to	1
which	1
one	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
draw	1
them	1
This	1
was	1
what	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
experiencing	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
Though	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
shut	1
on	1
them	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
whether	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
not	1
changed	1
by	1
now	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
receive	1
them	1
But	1
he	1
very	1
quickly	1
perceived	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
open	1
for	1
him	1
personally	1
it	1
was	1
closed	1
for	1
Anna	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
cat	1
and	1
mouse	1
the	1
hands	1
raised	1
for	1
him	1
were	1
dropped	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
Anna	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
ladies	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
whom	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
was	1
his	1
cousin	1
Betsy	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
greeted	1
him	1
joyfully	1
And	1
Anna	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
I	1
can	1
fancy	1
after	1
your	1
delightful	1
travels	1
you	1
must	1
find	1
our	1
poor	1
Petersburg	1
horrid	1
I	1
can	1
fancy	1
your	1
honeymoon	1
in	1
Rome	1
How	1
about	1
the	1
divorce	1
Is	1
that	1
all	1
over	1
Vronsky	1
noticed	1
that	1
Betsy	1
s	1
enthusiasm	1
waned	1
when	1
she	1
learned	1
that	1
no	1
divorce	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
taken	1
place	1
People	1
will	1
throw	1
stones	1
at	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
Anna	1
yes	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
You	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
here	1
long	1
I	1
suppose	1
And	1
she	1
did	1
certainly	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
but	1
her	1
tone	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
She	1
unmistakably	1
prided	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
courage	1
and	1
wished	1
Anna	1
to	1
appreciate	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
her	1
friendship	1
She	1
only	1
stayed	1
ten	1
minutes	1
talking	1
of	1
society	1
gossip	1
and	1
on	1
leaving	1
she	1
said	1
You	1
ve	1
never	1
told	1
me	1
when	1
the	1
divorce	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
Supposing	1
I	1
m	1
ready	1
to	1
fling	1
my	1
cap	1
over	1
the	1
mill	1
other	1
starchy	1
people	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
cold	1
shoulder	1
until	1
you	1
re	1
married	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
so	1
simple	1
nowadays	1
Ca	1
se	1
fait	1
So	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
on	1
Friday	1
Sorry	1
we	1
shan	1
t	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
again	1
From	1
Betsy	1
s	1
tone	1
Vronsky	1
might	1
have	1
grasped	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
expect	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
another	1
effort	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
family	1
His	1
mother	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reckon	1
upon	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
enthusiastic	1
over	1
Anna	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
acquaintance	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
mercy	1
on	1
her	1
now	1
for	1
having	1
ruined	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
career	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
more	1
hope	1
of	1
Varya	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
wife	1
He	1
fancied	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
throw	1
stones	1
and	1
would	1
go	1
simply	1
and	1
directly	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
and	1
would	1
receive	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
finding	1
her	1
alone	1
expressed	1
his	1
wishes	1
directly	1
You	1
know	1
Alexey	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
hearing	1
him	1
how	1
fond	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
how	1
ready	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
she	1
said	1
articulating	1
the	1
name	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
with	1
particular	1
care	1
Don	1
t	1
suppose	1
please	1
that	1
I	1
judge	1
her	1
Never	1
perhaps	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
glancing	1
timidly	1
at	1
his	1
gloomy	1
face	1
But	1
one	1
must	1
call	1
things	1
by	1
their	1
names	1
You	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
here	1
and	1
to	1
rehabilitate	1
her	1
in	1
society	1
but	1
do	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
daughters	1
growing	1
up	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
my	1
husband	1
s	1
sake	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
ready	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
she	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
ask	1
her	1
here	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
meet	1
people	1
who	1
look	1
at	1
things	1
differently	1
that	1
would	1
offend	1
her	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
raise	1
her	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
regard	1
her	1
as	1
fallen	1
more	1
than	1
hundreds	1
of	1
women	1
you	1
do	1
receive	1
Vronsky	1
interrupted	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
gloomily	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
in	1
silence	1
understanding	1
that	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
s	1
decision	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
Alexey	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
Please	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
began	1
Varya	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
smile	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
still	1
as	1
gloomily	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
in	1
two	1
ways	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
too	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
breaking	1
up	1
our	1
friendship	1
if	1
not	1
breaking	1
up	1
at	1
least	1
weakening	1
it	1
You	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
too	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
that	1
further	1
efforts	1
were	1
useless	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
spend	1
these	1
few	1
days	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
town	1
avoiding	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
relation	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
old	1
circle	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
annoyances	1
and	1
humiliations	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
intolerable	1
to	1
him	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
features	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
seemed	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
everywhere	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
anything	1
without	1
the	1
conversation	1
turning	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
anywhere	1
without	1
risk	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
So	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
finger	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
continually	1
as	1
though	1
on	1
purpose	1
grazing	1
his	1
sore	1
finger	1
on	1
everything	1
Their	1
stay	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
perceived	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
new	1
mood	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
in	1
Anna	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
would	1
seem	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
would	1
become	1
cold	1
irritable	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
She	1
was	1
worrying	1
over	1
something	1
and	1
keeping	1
something	1
back	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
humiliations	1
which	1
poisoned	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
delicate	1
intuition	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
still	1
more	1
unbearable	1
Chapter	1
29	1
One	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
objects	1
in	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
Russia	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
From	1
the	1
day	1
she	1
left	1
Italy	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
agitate	1
her	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
got	1
nearer	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
the	1
delight	1
and	1
importance	1
of	1
this	1
meeting	1
grew	1
ever	1
greater	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
put	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
it	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
natural	1
and	1
simple	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
when	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
town	1
with	1
him	1
But	1
on	1
her	1
arrival	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
made	1
distinctly	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
present	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
she	1
grasped	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
arrange	1
this	1
meeting	1
was	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
She	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
him	1
To	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
meet	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
She	1
might	1
be	1
refused	1
admittance	1
and	1
insulted	1
To	1
write	1
and	1
so	1
enter	1
into	1
relations	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
her	1
miserable	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
To	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
out	1
walking	1
finding	1
out	1
where	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
this	1
meeting	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
she	1
must	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
so	1
longed	1
to	1
embrace	1
him	1
to	1
kiss	1
him	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
old	1
nurse	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
But	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
not	1
now	1
living	1
in	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
house	1
In	1
this	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
in	1
efforts	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
nurse	1
two	1
days	1
had	1
slipped	1
by	1
Hearing	1
of	1
the	1
close	1
intimacy	1
between	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
Anna	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
which	1
cost	1
her	1
great	1
pains	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
intentionally	1
said	1
that	1
permission	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
generosity	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
letter	1
were	1
shown	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
up	1
his	1
character	1
of	1
magnanimity	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
her	1
request	1
The	1
commissionaire	1
who	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
back	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
and	1
unexpected	1
answer	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
humiliated	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
sending	1
for	1
the	1
commissionaire	1
she	1
heard	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
exact	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
waited	1
and	1
how	1
afterwards	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answer	1
Anna	1
felt	1
humiliated	1
insulted	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
from	1
her	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
right	1
Her	1
suffering	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
poignant	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
in	1
solitude	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
share	1
it	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
although	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
primary	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
distress	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
her	1
seeing	1
her	1
son	1
would	1
seem	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
very	1
little	1
consequence	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
understanding	1
all	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
her	1
suffering	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
cool	1
tone	1
at	1
any	1
allusion	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
hate	1
him	1
And	1
she	1
dreaded	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
hid	1
from	1
him	1
everything	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
Spending	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
at	1
home	1
she	1
considered	1
ways	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
had	1
reached	1
a	1
decision	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
She	1
was	1
just	1
composing	1
this	1
letter	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
handed	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
The	1
countess	1
s	1
silence	1
had	1
subdued	1
and	1
depressed	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
letter	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
read	1
between	1
the	1
lines	1
in	1
it	1
so	1
exasperated	1
her	1
this	1
malice	1
was	1
so	1
revolting	1
beside	1
her	1
passionate	1
legitimate	1
tenderness	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
that	1
she	1
turned	1
against	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
left	1
off	1
blaming	1
herself	1
This	1
coldness	1
this	1
pretense	1
of	1
feeling	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
They	1
must	1
needs	1
insult	1
me	1
and	1
torture	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
it	1
Not	1
on	1
any	1
consideration	1
She	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
lie	1
anyway	1
And	1
she	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
that	1
next	1
day	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
birthday	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
house	1
bribe	1
or	1
deceive	1
the	1
servants	1
but	1
at	1
any	1
cost	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
overturn	1
the	1
hideous	1
deception	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
encompassing	1
the	1
unhappy	1
child	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
toy	1
shop	1
bought	1
toys	1
and	1
thought	1
over	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
action	1
She	1
would	1
go	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
would	1
be	1
certain	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
up	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
money	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
and	1
the	1
footman	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
her	1
in	1
and	1
not	1
raising	1
her	1
veil	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
godfather	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
charged	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
toys	1
at	1
his	1
bedside	1
She	1
had	1
prepared	1
everything	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
Often	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
dreamed	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
at	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Anna	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
and	1
rang	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
home	1
Run	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
s	1
wanted	1
Some	1
lady	1
said	1
Kapitonitch	1
who	1
not	1
yet	1
dressed	1
in	1
his	1
overcoat	1
and	1
galoshes	1
had	1
peeped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
seen	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
veil	1
standing	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
His	1
assistant	1
a	1
lad	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
pulling	1
a	1
three	1
rouble	1
note	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
put	1
it	1
hurriedly	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
Seryozha	1
Sergey	1
Alexeitch	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
Scrutinizing	1
the	1
note	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
assistant	1
stopped	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
glass	1
door	1
Whom	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
he	1
asked	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
Noticing	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
lady	1
Kapitonitch	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
opened	1
the	1
second	1
door	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
want	1
From	1
Prince	1
Skorodumov	1
for	1
Sergey	1
Alexeitch	1
she	1
said	1
His	1
honor	1
s	1
not	1
up	1
yet	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
attentively	1
Anna	1
had	1
not	1
anticipated	1
that	1
the	1
absolutely	1
unchanged	1
hall	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
lived	1
for	1
nine	1
years	1
would	1
so	1
greatly	1
affect	1
her	1
Memories	1
sweet	1
and	1
painful	1
rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
forgot	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
here	1
for	1
Would	1
you	1
kindly	1
wait	1
said	1
Kapitonitch	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
fur	1
cloak	1
As	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
cloak	1
Kapitonitch	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
face	1
recognized	1
her	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
in	1
silence	1
Please	1
walk	1
in	1
your	1
excellency	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
her	1
voice	1
refused	1
to	1
utter	1
any	1
sound	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
and	1
imploring	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
light	1
swift	1
steps	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
Bent	1
double	1
and	1
his	1
galoshes	1
catching	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
Kapitonitch	1
ran	1
after	1
her	1
trying	1
to	1
overtake	1
her	1
The	1
tutor	1
s	1
there	1
maybe	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
dressed	1
I	1
ll	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
Anna	1
still	1
mounted	1
the	1
familiar	1
staircase	1
not	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
saying	1
This	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
Excuse	1
its	1
not	1
being	1
tidy	1
His	1
honor	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
parlor	1
now	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
said	1
panting	1
Excuse	1
me	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
your	1
excellency	1
I	1
ll	1
just	1
see	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
overtaking	1
her	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
high	1
door	1
and	1
disappeared	1
behind	1
it	1
Anna	1
stood	1
still	1
waiting	1
He	1
s	1
only	1
just	1
awake	1
said	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
coming	1
out	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
the	1
porter	1
said	1
this	1
Anna	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
childish	1
yawn	1
From	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
yawn	1
alone	1
she	1
knew	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
living	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
Let	1
me	1
in	1
go	1
away	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
high	1
doorway	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
stood	1
a	1
bed	1
and	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
the	1
boy	1
His	1
little	1
body	1
bent	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
nightshirt	1
unbuttoned	1
he	1
was	1
stretching	1
and	1
still	1
yawning	1
The	1
instant	1
his	1
lips	1
came	1
together	1
they	1
curved	1
into	1
a	1
blissfully	1
sleepy	1
smile	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
smile	1
he	1
slowly	1
and	1
deliciously	1
rolled	1
back	1
again	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
whispered	1
going	1
noiselessly	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
latter	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
a	1
fresh	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
pictured	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
four	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
loved	1
him	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
year	1
old	1
baby	1
more	1
grown	1
and	1
thinner	1
How	1
thin	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
how	1
short	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
What	1
long	1
hands	1
How	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
she	1
left	1
him	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
his	1
lips	1
his	1
soft	1
neck	1
and	1
broad	1
little	1
shoulders	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
repeated	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
ear	1
He	1
raised	1
himself	1
again	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
turned	1
his	1
tangled	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
as	1
though	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
Slowly	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
several	1
seconds	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
standing	1
motionless	1
before	1
him	1
then	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
smiled	1
a	1
blissful	1
smile	1
and	1
shutting	1
his	1
eyes	1
rolled	1
not	1
backwards	1
but	1
towards	1
her	1
into	1
her	1
arms	1
Seryozha	1
my	1
darling	1
boy	1
she	1
said	1
breathing	1
hard	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
plump	1
little	1
body	1
Mother	1
he	1
said	1
wriggling	1
about	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
touch	1
her	1
hands	1
with	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
him	1
Smiling	1
sleepily	1
still	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
he	1
flung	1
fat	1
little	1
arms	1
round	1
her	1
shoulders	1
rolled	1
towards	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
delicious	1
sleepy	1
warmth	1
and	1
fragrance	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
children	1
and	1
began	1
rubbing	1
his	1
face	1
against	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
said	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
it	1
s	1
my	1
birthday	1
today	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
d	1
come	1
I	1
ll	1
get	1
up	1
directly	1
And	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
Anna	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
hungrily	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
and	1
changed	1
in	1
her	1
absence	1
She	1
knew	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
bare	1
legs	1
so	1
long	1
now	1
that	1
were	1
thrust	1
out	1
below	1
the	1
quilt	1
those	1
short	1
cropped	1
curls	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
kissed	1
him	1
She	1
touched	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
tears	1
choked	1
her	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
crying	1
for	1
mother	1
he	1
said	1
waking	1
completely	1
up	1
Mother	1
what	1

for	1

cried	1
in	1
a	1

gulping	1
down	1
her	1

and	1
turning	1
away	1
Come	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
now	1
she	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
and	1
never	1
letting	1
go	1
his	1
hands	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
bedside	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
where	1
his	1
clothes	1
were	1
put	1
ready	1
for	1
him	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
dress	1
without	1
me	1
How	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
begin	1
talking	1
simply	1
and	1
cheerfully	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
I	1

He	1
ll	1
come	1
in	1
soon	1
Why	1
you	1
re	1
sitting	1
on	1
my	1
clothes	1
And	1
Seryozha	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
peal	1
of	1
laughter	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
smiled	1
Mother	1
darling	1
sweet	1
one	1
he	1
shouted	1
flinging	1
himself	1
on	1
her	1
again	1
and	1
hugging	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
only	1
now	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
smile	1
he	1
fully	1
grasped	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
that	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
seeing	1
her	1
afresh	1
without	1
her	1
hat	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
kissing	1
her	1
again	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
me	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
think	1
I	1
was	1

I	1
never	1

it	1
You	1

sweet	1
I	1

I	1

he	1
repeated	1
his	1
favorite	1
phrase	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
stroking	1
his	1
hair	1
he	1
pressed	1
the	1
open	1
palm	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
Chapter	1
30	1
Meanwhile	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
understood	1
who	1
this	1
lady	1
was	1
and	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
their	1
conversation	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
person	1
than	1
the	1
mother	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
after	1
her	1
departure	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
or	1
not	1
or	1
whether	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Reflecting	1
finally	1
that	1
his	1
duty	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
Seryozha	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
fixed	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
therefore	1
not	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
consider	1
who	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
mother	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
but	1
simply	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
duty	1
he	1
finished	1
dressing	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
But	1
the	1
embraces	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
child	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
voices	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
made	1
him	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
He	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
I	1
ll	1
wait	1
another	1
ten	1
minutes	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
clearing	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
wiping	1
away	1
tears	1
Among	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
there	1
was	1
intense	1
excitement	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
All	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
their	1
mistress	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
that	1
Kapitonitch	1
had	1
let	1
her	1
in	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
even	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
master	1
always	1
went	1
in	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
at	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
everyone	1
fully	1
comprehended	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
prevent	1
it	1
Korney	1
the	1
valet	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
asked	1
who	1
had	1
let	1
her	1
in	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
and	1
ascertaining	1
that	1
Kapitonitch	1
had	1
admitted	1
her	1
and	1
shown	1
her	1
up	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
a	1
talking	1
to	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
was	1
doggedly	1
silent	1
but	1
when	1
Korney	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
away	1
Kapitonitch	1
darted	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
waving	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
Korney	1
s	1
face	1
began	1
Oh	1

After	1

Soldier	1
said	1
Korney	1
contemptuously	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
Here	1
what	1

he	1
let	1
her	1
in	1
without	1

Korney	1
said	1
addressing	1
her	1
Alexey	1

into	1
the	1

A	1

the	1

while	1

and	1

her	1
away	1
somehow	1
A	1
pretty	1
business	1
When	1
the	1
nurse	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
Seryozha	1
was	1
telling	1
his	1
mother	1
how	1
he	1
and	1
Nadinka	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
fall	1
in	1
sledging	1
downhill	1
and	1
had	1
turned	1
over	1
three	1
times	1
She	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
watching	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
it	1
touching	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
She	1
must	1
go	1
she	1
must	1
leave	1
him	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
coughing	1
she	1
heard	1
too	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
nurse	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
near	1
but	1
she	1
sat	1
like	1
one	1
turned	1
to	1
stone	1
incapable	1
of	1
beginning	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
Mistress	1
darling	1
began	1
the	1
nurse	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
shoulders	1
God	1
has	1
brought	1
joy	1
indeed	1
to	1
our	1
boy	1
on	1
his	1
birthday	1
You	1
aren	1
t	1
changed	1
one	1
bit	1
Oh	1
nurse	1
dear	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
said	1
Anna	1
rousing	1
herself	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
living	1
here	1
I	1
m	1
living	1
with	1
my	1
daughter	1
I	1
came	1
for	1
the	1
birthday	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
darling	1
The	1
nurse	1
suddenly	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
and	1
began	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
again	1
Seryozha	1
with	1
radiant	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiles	1
holding	1
his	1
mother	1
by	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
nurse	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
pattered	1
on	1
the	1
rug	1
with	1
his	1
fat	1
little	1
bare	1
feet	1
The	1
tenderness	1
shown	1
by	1
his	1
beloved	1
nurse	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
threw	1
him	1
into	1
an	1
ecstasy	1
Mother	1
She	1
often	1
comes	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
comes	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
noticing	1
that	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dread	1
and	1
something	1
like	1
shame	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
strangely	1
unbecoming	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
My	1
sweet	1
she	1
said	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
said	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
Darling	1
darling	1
Kootik	1
she	1
used	1
the	1
name	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
forget	1
me	1
You	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
How	1
often	1
afterwards	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
words	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
But	1
now	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
But	1
Seryozha	1
knew	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
unhappy	1
and	1
loved	1
him	1
He	1
understood	1
even	1
what	1
the	1
nurse	1
had	1
whispered	1
He	1
had	1
caught	1
the	1
words	1
always	1
at	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
could	1
not	1
meet	1
That	1
he	1
understood	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dread	1
and	1
shame	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
fault	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
something	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
question	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
at	1
rest	1
this	1
doubt	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
miserable	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
Silently	1
he	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
whispered	1
Don	1
t	1
go	1
yet	1
He	1
won	1
t	1
come	1
just	1
yet	1
The	1
mother	1
held	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
frightened	1
face	1
she	1
read	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
asking	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
his	1
father	1
Seryozha	1
my	1
darling	1
she	1
said	1
love	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
better	1
and	1
kinder	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
him	1
wrong	1
When	1
you	1
grow	1
up	1
you	1
will	1
judge	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
he	1
cried	1
in	1
despair	1
through	1
his	1
tears	1
and	1
clutching	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
he	1
began	1
squeezing	1
her	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
force	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
arms	1
trembling	1
with	1
the	1
strain	1
My	1
sweet	1
my	1
little	1
one	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
she	1
cried	1
as	1
weakly	1
and	1
childishly	1
as	1
he	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
Vassily	1
Lukitch	1
came	1
in	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
whisper	1
said	1
He	1
s	1
coming	1
and	1
gave	1
Anna	1
her	1
hat	1
Seryozha	1
sank	1
onto	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
sobbed	1
hiding	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
Anna	1
removed	1
his	1
hands	1
once	1
more	1
kissed	1
his	1
wet	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
walked	1
in	1
meeting	1
her	1
Seeing	1
her	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
Although	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
better	1
and	1
kinder	1
than	1
she	1
in	1
the	1
rapid	1
glance	1
she	1
flung	1
at	1
him	1
taking	1
in	1
his	1
whole	1
figure	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
details	1
feelings	1
of	1
repulsion	1
and	1
hatred	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
jealousy	1
over	1
her	1
son	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
With	1
a	1
swift	1
gesture	1
she	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
veil	1
and	1
quickening	1
her	1
pace	1
almost	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
undo	1
and	1
so	1
carried	1
back	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
parcel	1
of	1
toys	1
she	1
had	1
chosen	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
a	1
toy	1
shop	1
with	1
such	1
love	1
and	1
sorrow	1
Chapter	1
31	1
As	1
intensely	1
as	1
Anna	1
had	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
preparing	1
herself	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
that	1
seeing	1
him	1
would	1
affect	1
her	1
so	1
deeply	1
On	1
getting	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
lonely	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
hotel	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
understand	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
again	1
alone	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
hearth	1
Fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
a	1
bronze	1
clock	1
standing	1
on	1
a	1
table	1
between	1
the	1
windows	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
The	1
French	1
maid	1
brought	1
from	1
abroad	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
suggest	1
she	1
should	1
dress	1
She	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
wonderingly	1
and	1
said	1
Presently	1
A	1
footman	1
offered	1
her	1
coffee	1
Later	1
on	1
she	1
said	1
The	1
Italian	1
nurse	1
after	1
having	1
taken	1
the	1
baby	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
best	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
Anna	1
The	1
plump	1
well	1
fed	1
little	1
baby	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
mother	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
fat	1
little	1
hands	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
toothless	1
mouth	1
began	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
with	1
a	1
float	1
bobbing	1
her	1
fingers	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
starched	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
embroidered	1
skirt	1
making	1
them	1
rustle	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
smile	1
not	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
baby	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
hold	1
out	1
a	1
finger	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
clutch	1
crowing	1
and	1
prancing	1
all	1
over	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
offer	1
her	1
a	1
lip	1
which	1
she	1
sucked	1
into	1
her	1
little	1
mouth	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
kiss	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
Anna	1
did	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
dance	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
fresh	1
little	1
cheek	1
and	1
bare	1
little	1
elbows	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
child	1
it	1
was	1
plainer	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
for	1
her	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
love	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
Seryozha	1
Everything	1
in	1
this	1
baby	1
was	1
charming	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
all	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
deep	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
On	1
her	1
first	1
child	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
an	1
unloved	1
father	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
all	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
found	1
satisfaction	1
Her	1
baby	1
girl	1
had	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
painful	1
circumstances	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
thought	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
concentrated	1
on	1
her	1
first	1
child	1
Besides	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
everything	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
while	1
Seryozha	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
almost	1
a	1
personality	1
and	1
a	1
personality	1
dearly	1
loved	1
In	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
conflict	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
he	1
understood	1
her	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
he	1
judged	1
her	1
she	1
thought	1
recalling	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
forever	1
not	1
physically	1
only	1
but	1
spiritually	1
divided	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
set	1
this	1
right	1
She	1
gave	1
the	1
baby	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
locket	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
Seryozha	1
s	1
portrait	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
as	1
the	1
girl	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
hat	1
took	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
an	1
album	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
photographs	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
at	1
different	1
ages	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
compare	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
taking	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
album	1
She	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
except	1
one	1
the	1
latest	1
and	1
best	1
photograph	1
In	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
smock	1
sitting	1
astride	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
frowning	1
eyes	1
and	1
smiling	1
lips	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
best	1
most	1
characteristic	1
expression	1
With	1
her	1
little	1
supple	1
hands	1
her	1
white	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
that	1
moved	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
intensity	1
today	1
she	1
pulled	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
photograph	1
but	1
the	1
photograph	1
had	1
caught	1
somewhere	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
out	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
paper	1
knife	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
so	1
pulling	1
out	1
the	1
photograph	1
that	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
photograph	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
taken	1
at	1
Rome	1
in	1
a	1
round	1
hat	1
and	1
with	1
long	1
hair	1
she	1
used	1
it	1
to	1
push	1
out	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
photograph	1
Oh	1
here	1
is	1
he	1
she	1
said	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
suddenly	1
recalled	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
present	1
misery	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
But	1
now	1
coming	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
that	1
manly	1
noble	1
face	1
so	1
familiar	1
and	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
rush	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
him	1
But	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
alone	1
in	1
my	1
misery	1
she	1
thought	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
reproach	1
forgetting	1
she	1
had	1
herself	1
kept	1
from	1
him	1
everything	1
concerning	1
her	1
son	1
She	1
sent	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
immediately	1
with	1
a	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
she	1
awaited	1
him	1
rehearsing	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
all	1
and	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
love	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
console	1
her	1
The	1
messenger	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
answer	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
visitor	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
immediately	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
bring	1
with	1
him	1
Prince	1
Yashvin	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
coming	1
alone	1
and	1
since	1
dinner	1
yesterday	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
seen	1
me	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
coming	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
him	1
everything	1
but	1
coming	1
with	1
Yashvin	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
strange	1
idea	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
what	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
And	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
everything	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
this	1
terrible	1
idea	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
dined	1
at	1
home	1
yesterday	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
insisted	1
on	1
their	1
taking	1
separate	1
sets	1
of	1
rooms	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
coming	1
to	1
her	1
alone	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
But	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
I	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
If	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
then	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
picture	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
position	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
his	1
not	1
caring	1
for	1
her	1
She	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
she	1
felt	1
close	1
upon	1
despair	1
and	1
consequently	1
she	1
felt	1
exceptionally	1
alert	1
She	1
rang	1
for	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
dressing	1
room	1
As	1
she	1
dressed	1
she	1
took	1
more	1
care	1
over	1
her	1
appearance	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
those	1
days	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
again	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
dressed	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
hair	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
most	1
becoming	1
to	1
her	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
ring	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
When	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
he	1
but	1
Yashvin	1
who	1
met	1
her	1
eyes	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
looking	1
through	1
the	1
photographs	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
haste	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
We	1
have	1
met	1
already	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
her	1
little	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
huge	1
hand	1
of	1
Yashvin	1
whose	1
bashfulness	1
was	1
so	1
queerly	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
immense	1
frame	1
and	1
coarse	1
face	1
We	1
met	1
last	1
year	1
at	1
the	1
races	1
Give	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
snatching	1
from	1
Vronsky	1
the	1
photographs	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
and	1
glancing	1
significantly	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
Were	1
the	1
races	1
good	1
this	1
year	1
Instead	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
races	1
in	1
the	1
Corso	1
in	1
Rome	1
But	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
life	1
abroad	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
cordial	1
smile	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
tastes	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
so	1
little	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
tastes	1
are	1
mostly	1
bad	1
said	1
Yashvin	1
gnawing	1
at	1
his	1
left	1
mustache	1
Having	1
talked	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
clock	1
Yashvin	1
asked	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
staying	1
much	1
longer	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
unbending	1
his	1
huge	1
figure	1
reached	1
after	1
his	1
cap	1
Not	1
long	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
hesitatingly	1
glancing	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
So	1
then	1
we	1
shan	1
t	1
meet	1
again	1
Come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
Anna	1
resolutely	1
angry	1
it	1
seemed	1
with	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
embarrassment	1
but	1
flushing	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
she	1
defined	1
her	1
position	1
before	1
a	1
fresh	1
person	1
The	1
dinner	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
him	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
Alexey	1
cares	1
for	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
for	1
you	1
Delighted	1
said	1
Yashvin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
from	1
which	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
liked	1
Anna	1
very	1
much	1
Yashvin	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
Vronsky	1
stayed	1
behind	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
too	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
m	1
late	1
already	1
he	1
answered	1
Run	1
along	1
I	1
ll	1
catch	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
She	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
without	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
while	1
she	1
ransacked	1
her	1
mind	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
would	1
keep	1
him	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
broad	1
hand	1
she	1
pressed	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
Oh	1
was	1
it	1
right	1
my	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
You	1
did	1
quite	1
right	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
serene	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
even	1
teeth	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
Alexey	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
changed	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
of	1
hers	1
Alexey	1
I	1
am	1
miserable	1
here	1
When	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
away	1
Soon	1
soon	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
disagreeable	1
our	1
way	1
of	1
living	1
here	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
too	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
away	1
his	1
hand	1
Well	1
go	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
offense	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
quickly	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
Chapter	1
32	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
returned	1
home	1
Anna	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
home	1
Soon	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
some	1
lady	1
so	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
That	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
without	1
leaving	1
word	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
somewhere	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
this	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
strange	1
look	1
of	1
excitement	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
hostile	1
tone	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
before	1
Yashvin	1
almost	1
snatched	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
photographs	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
made	1
him	1
serious	1
He	1
decided	1
he	1
absolutely	1
must	1
speak	1
openly	1
with	1
her	1
And	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
But	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
alone	1
but	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
old	1
unmarried	1
aunt	1
Princess	1
Oblonskaya	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
Anna	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
shopping	1
Anna	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
worried	1
and	1
inquiring	1
expression	1
and	1
began	1
a	1
lively	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
morning	1
s	1
shopping	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
working	1
within	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
flashing	1
eyes	1
when	1
they	1
rested	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
on	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
intense	1
concentration	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
words	1
and	1
movements	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
nervous	1
rapidity	1
and	1
grace	1
which	1
during	1
the	1
early	1
period	1
of	1
their	1
intimacy	1
had	1
so	1
fascinated	1
him	1
but	1
which	1
now	1
so	1
disturbed	1
and	1
alarmed	1
him	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
laid	1
for	1
four	1
All	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
and	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
dining	1
room	1
when	1
Tushkevitch	1
made	1
his	1
appearance	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
excuse	1
her	1
not	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
indisposed	1
but	1
begged	1
Anna	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
between	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
and	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
Vronsky	1
glanced	1
at	1
Anna	1
at	1
the	1
precise	1
limit	1
of	1
time	1
so	1
suggestive	1
of	1
steps	1
having	1
been	1
taken	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
meet	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
Anna	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
it	1
Very	1
sorry	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
come	1
just	1
between	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
and	1
nine	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
The	1
princess	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
And	1
so	1
am	1
I	1
You	1
re	1
going	1
no	1
doubt	1
to	1
hear	1
Patti	1
said	1
Tushkevitch	1
Patti	1
You	1
suggest	1
the	1
idea	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
box	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
one	1
Tushkevitch	1
offered	1
his	1
services	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
said	1
Anna	1
But	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
dine	1
with	1
us	1
Vronsky	1
gave	1
a	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
shrug	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
complete	1
loss	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
Anna	1
was	1
about	1
What	1
had	1
she	1
brought	1
the	1
old	1
Princess	1
Oblonskaya	1
home	1
for	1
what	1
had	1
she	1
made	1
Tushkevitch	1
stay	1
to	1
dinner	1
for	1
and	1
most	1
amazing	1
of	1
all	1
why	1
was	1
she	1
sending	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
box	1
Could	1
she	1
possibly	1
think	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Patti	1
s	1
benefit	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
would	1
be	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
serious	1
eyes	1
but	1
she	1
responded	1
with	1
that	1
defiant	1
half	1
mirthful	1
half	1
desperate	1
look	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
At	1
dinner	1
Anna	1
was	1
in	1
aggressively	1
high	1
spirits	1
she	1
almost	1
flirted	1
both	1
with	1
Tushkevitch	1
and	1
with	1
Yashvin	1
When	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
dinner	1
and	1
Tushkevitch	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
box	1
at	1
the	1
opera	1
Yashvin	1
went	1
to	1
smoke	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
rooms	1
After	1
sitting	1
there	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
Anna	1
was	1
already	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
necked	1
gown	1
of	1
light	1
silk	1
and	1
velvet	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
Paris	1
and	1
with	1
costly	1
white	1
lace	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
framing	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
particularly	1
becoming	1
showing	1
up	1
her	1
dazzling	1
beauty	1
Are	1
you	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
theater	1
he	1
said	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
ask	1
with	1
such	1
alarm	1
she	1
said	1
wounded	1
again	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
Why	1
shouldn	1
t	1
I	1
go	1
She	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
Oh	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
reason	1
whatever	1
he	1
said	1
frowning	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
she	1
said	1
willfully	1
refusing	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
irony	1
of	1
his	1
tone	1
and	1
quietly	1
turning	1
back	1
her	1
long	1
perfumed	1
glove	1
Anna	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
appealing	1
to	1
her	1
exactly	1
as	1
once	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
done	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
asking	1
You	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
go	1
Why	1
so	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
alone	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
dress	1
she	1
is	1
going	1
with	1
me	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
perplexity	1
and	1
despair	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
he	1
began	1
But	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
know	1
she	1
almost	1
shrieked	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
Do	1
I	1
regret	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
No	1
no	1
no	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
do	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
For	1
us	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
matters	1
whether	1
we	1
love	1
each	1
other	1
Other	1
people	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
consider	1
Why	1
are	1
we	1
living	1
here	1
apart	1
and	1
not	1
seeing	1
each	1
other	1
Why	1
can	1
t	1
I	1
go	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
Russian	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
gleam	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
changed	1
to	1
me	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
He	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
full	1
dress	1
always	1
so	1
becoming	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
now	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
elegance	1
were	1
just	1
what	1
irritated	1
him	1
My	1
feeling	1
cannot	1
change	1
you	1
know	1
but	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
in	1
French	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
tender	1
supplication	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
but	1
with	1
coldness	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
coldness	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
answered	1
with	1
irritation	1
And	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
explain	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
Because	1
it	1
might	1
cause	1
you	1

hesitated	1

Chapter	1
33	1
Vronsky	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
anger	1
against	1
Anna	1
almost	1
a	1
hatred	1
for	1
her	1
willfully	1
refusing	1
to	1
understand	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
This	1
feeling	1
was	1
aggravated	1
by	1
his	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
plainly	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
anger	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
directly	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
In	1
that	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
princess	1
only	1
too	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
everyone	1
to	1
show	1
yourself	1
at	1
the	1
theater	1
is	1
equivalent	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
acknowledging	1
your	1
position	1
as	1
a	1
fallen	1
woman	1
but	1
is	1
flinging	1
down	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1
society	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
cutting	1
yourself	1
off	1
from	1
it	1
forever	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
she	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
He	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
his	1
respect	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
diminished	1
while	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
was	1
intensified	1
He	1
went	1
back	1
scowling	1
to	1
his	1
rooms	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
Yashvin	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
stretched	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
was	1
drinking	1
brandy	1
and	1
seltzer	1
water	1
he	1
ordered	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
himself	1
You	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
Lankovsky	1
s	1
Powerful	1
That	1
s	1
a	1
fine	1
horse	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
buy	1
him	1
said	1
Yashvin	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
comrade	1
s	1
gloomy	1
face	1
His	1
hind	1
quarters	1
aren	1
t	1
quite	1
first	1
rate	1
but	1
the	1
legs	1
and	1
head	1
one	1
couldn	1
t	1
wish	1
for	1
anything	1
better	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
him	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
Their	1
conversation	1
about	1
horses	1
interested	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
forget	1
Anna	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
clock	1
on	1
the	1
chimney	1
piece	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
theater	1
Yashvin	1
tipping	1
another	1
glass	1
of	1
brandy	1
into	1
the	1
bubbling	1
water	1
drank	1
it	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
buttoning	1
his	1
coat	1
Well	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
faintly	1
smiling	1
under	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
showing	1
by	1
this	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
gloominess	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
attach	1
any	1
significance	1
to	1
it	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
Vronsky	1
answered	1
gloomily	1
Well	1
I	1
must	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
Good	1
bye	1
then	1
If	1
you	1
do	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
stalls	1
you	1
can	1
take	1
Kruzin	1
s	1
stall	1
added	1
Yashvin	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
busy	1
A	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
care	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
worse	1
when	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
wife	1
thought	1
Yashvin	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hotel	1
Vronsky	1
left	1
alone	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
began	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
And	1
what	1
s	1
today	1
The	1
fourth	1
night	1
Yegor	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
are	1
there	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
most	1
likely	1
Of	1
course	1
all	1
Petersburg	1
s	1
there	1
Now	1
she	1
s	1
gone	1
in	1
taken	1
off	1
her	1
cloak	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
Tushkevitch	1
Yashvin	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
he	1
pictured	1
them	1
to	1
himself	1
What	1
about	1
me	1
Either	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
frightened	1
or	1
have	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
Tushkevitch	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
protect	1
her	1
From	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
stupid	1
stupid	1
And	1
why	1
is	1
she	1
putting	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair	1
With	1
that	1
gesture	1
he	1
knocked	1
against	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
standing	1
the	1
seltzer	1
water	1
and	1
the	1
decanter	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
almost	1
upset	1
it	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
it	1
let	1
it	1
slip	1
and	1
angrily	1
kicked	1
the	1
table	1
over	1
and	1
rang	1
If	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
service	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
valet	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
remember	1
your	1
duties	1
This	1
shouldn	1
t	1
be	1
here	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
cleared	1
away	1
The	1
valet	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
innocence	1
would	1
have	1
defended	1
himself	1
but	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
saw	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
threading	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
dropped	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
began	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
and	1
broken	1
glasses	1
and	1
bottles	1
That	1
s	1
not	1
your	1
duty	1
send	1
the	1
waiter	1
to	1
clear	1
away	1
and	1
get	1
my	1
dress	1
coat	1
out	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
theater	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
eight	1
The	1
performance	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing	1
The	1
little	1
old	1
box	1
keeper	1
recognizing	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
he	1
helped	1
him	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
called	1
him	1
Your	1
Excellency	1
and	1
suggested	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
number	1
but	1
should	1
simply	1
call	1
Fyodor	1
In	1
the	1
brightly	1
lighted	1
corridor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
box	1
opener	1
and	1
two	1
attendants	1
with	1
fur	1
cloaks	1
on	1
their	1
arms	1
listening	1
at	1
the	1
doors	1
Through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
discreet	1
staccato	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
the	1
orchestra	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
female	1
voice	1
rendering	1
distinctly	1
a	1
musical	1
phrase	1
The	1
door	1
opened	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
box	1
opener	1
slip	1
through	1
and	1
the	1
phrase	1
drawing	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
reached	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
hearing	1
clearly	1
But	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
closed	1
again	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
phrase	1
and	1
the	1
cadence	1
of	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
applause	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
When	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
with	1
chandeliers	1
and	1
gas	1
jets	1
the	1
noise	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on	1
On	1
the	1
stage	1
the	1
singer	1
bowing	1
and	1
smiling	1
with	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
flashing	1
with	1
diamonds	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
tenor	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
his	1
arm	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
bouquets	1
that	1
were	1
flying	1
awkwardly	1
over	1
the	1
footlights	1
Then	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
with	1
glossy	1
pomaded	1
hair	1
parted	1
down	1
the	1
center	1
who	1
was	1
stretching	1
across	1
the	1
footlights	1
holding	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
public	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
boxes	1
was	1
in	1
excitement	1
craning	1
forward	1
shouting	1
and	1
clapping	1
The	1
conductor	1
in	1
his	1
high	1
chair	1
assisted	1
in	1
passing	1
the	1
offering	1
and	1
straightened	1
his	1
white	1
tie	1
Vronsky	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stalls	1
and	1
standing	1
still	1
began	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
That	1
day	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
was	1
his	1
attention	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
familiar	1
habitual	1
surroundings	1
the	1
stage	1
the	1
noise	1
all	1
the	1
familiar	1
uninteresting	1
particolored	1
herd	1
of	1
spectators	1
in	1
the	1
packed	1
theater	1
There	1
were	1
as	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
ladies	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
with	1
officers	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
boxes	1
the	1
same	1
gaily	1
dressed	1
women	1
God	1
knows	1
who	1
and	1
uniforms	1
and	1
black	1
coats	1
the	1
same	1
dirty	1
crowd	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
gallery	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
crowd	1
in	1
the	1
boxes	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
rows	1
were	1
some	1
forty	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
people	1
And	1
to	1
those	1
oases	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
once	1
directed	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
entered	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
relation	1
The	1
act	1
was	1
over	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
box	1
but	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
of	1
stalls	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
footlights	1
with	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
who	1
standing	1
with	1
one	1
knee	1
raised	1
and	1
his	1
heel	1
on	1
the	1
footlights	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him	1
smiling	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
Anna	1
He	1
purposely	1
avoided	1
looking	1
in	1
her	1
direction	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
people	1
s	1
eyes	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
He	1
looked	1
round	1
discreetly	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
seeking	1
her	1
expecting	1
the	1
worst	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
To	1
his	1
relief	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
theater	1
that	1
evening	1
How	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
man	1
there	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
you	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
him	1
A	1
diplomat	1
an	1
artist	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
one	1
would	1
say	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
going	1
back	1
home	1
when	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
black	1
coat	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
and	1
slowly	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
opera	1
glass	1
Well	1
I	1
ll	1
own	1
I	1
envy	1
you	1
there	1
When	1
I	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
this	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
epaulets	1
I	1
regret	1
my	1
freedom	1
Serpuhovskoy	1
had	1
long	1
given	1
up	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
career	1
but	1
he	1
liked	1
him	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
particularly	1
cordial	1
to	1
him	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
act	1
Vronsky	1
listening	1
with	1
one	1
ear	1
moved	1
his	1
opera	1
glass	1
from	1
the	1
stalls	1
and	1
scanned	1
the	1
boxes	1
Near	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
turban	1
and	1
a	1
bald	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
wave	1
angrily	1
in	1
the	1
moving	1
opera	1
glass	1
Vronsky	1
suddenly	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
head	1
proud	1
strikingly	1
beautiful	1
and	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
lace	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
box	1
twenty	1
paces	1
from	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
slightly	1
turning	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
The	1
setting	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
her	1
handsome	1
broad	1
shoulders	1
and	1
the	1
restrained	1
excitement	1
and	1
brilliance	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
face	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
Moscow	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
utterly	1
different	1
towards	1
her	1
beauty	1
now	1
In	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
element	1
of	1
mystery	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
beauty	1
though	1
it	1
attracted	1
him	1
even	1
more	1
intensely	1
than	1
before	1
gave	1
him	1
now	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
injury	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
in	1
his	1
direction	1
but	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
already	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
turned	1
the	1
opera	1
glass	1
again	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
was	1
particularly	1
red	1
and	1
kept	1
laughing	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
Anna	1
folding	1
her	1
fan	1
and	1
tapping	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
velvet	1
was	1
gazing	1
away	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
Yashvin	1
s	1
face	1
wore	1
the	1
expression	1
which	1
was	1
common	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
at	1
cards	1
Scowling	1
he	1
sucked	1
the	1
left	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
mustache	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
into	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
cast	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
box	1
In	1
that	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
were	1
the	1
Kartasovs	1
Vronsky	1
knew	1
them	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them	1
Madame	1
Kartasova	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
woman	1
was	1
standing	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
box	1
and	1
her	1
back	1
turned	1
upon	1
Anna	1
she	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
a	1
mantle	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
holding	1
for	1
her	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
angry	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
excitedly	1
Kartasov	1
a	1
fat	1
bald	1
man	1
was	1
continually	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Anna	1
while	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
soothe	1
his	1
wife	1
When	1
the	1
wife	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
the	1
husband	1
lingered	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
Anna	1
s	1
eye	1
obviously	1
anxious	1
to	1
bow	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
Anna	1
with	1
unmistakable	1
intention	1
avoided	1
noticing	1
him	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
whose	1
cropped	1
head	1
was	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
Kartasov	1
went	1
out	1
without	1
making	1
his	1
salutation	1
and	1
the	1
box	1
was	1
left	1
empty	1
Vronsky	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
Kartasovs	1
and	1
Anna	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
humiliating	1
for	1
Anna	1
had	1
happened	1
He	1
knew	1
this	1
both	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Anna	1
who	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
taxing	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
carry	1
through	1
the	1
part	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
And	1
in	1
maintaining	1
this	1
attitude	1
of	1
external	1
composure	1
she	1
was	1
completely	1
successful	1
Anyone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
circle	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
utterances	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
expressive	1
of	1
commiseration	1
indignation	1
and	1
amazement	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
show	1
herself	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
show	1
herself	1
so	1
conspicuously	1
with	1
her	1
lace	1
and	1
her	1
beauty	1
would	1
have	1
admired	1
the	1
serenity	1
and	1
loveliness	1
of	1
this	1
woman	1
without	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
undergoing	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
stocks	1
Knowing	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
but	1
not	1
knowing	1
precisely	1
what	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
agonizing	1
anxiety	1
and	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
something	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
box	1
Purposely	1
choosing	1
the	1
way	1
round	1
furthest	1
from	1
Anna	1
s	1
box	1
he	1
jostled	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
regiment	1
talking	1
to	1
two	1
acquaintances	1
Vronsky	1
heard	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
and	1
noticed	1
how	1
the	1
colonel	1
hastened	1
to	1
address	1
Vronsky	1
loudly	1
by	1
name	1
with	1
a	1
meaning	1
glance	1
at	1
his	1
companions	1
Ah	1
Vronsky	1
When	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
We	1
can	1
t	1
let	1
you	1
off	1
without	1
a	1
supper	1
You	1
re	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
set	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
his	1
regiment	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
stop	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
another	1
time	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
he	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
towards	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
box	1
The	1
old	1
countess	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
mother	1
with	1
her	1
steel	1
gray	1
curls	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
box	1
Varya	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
Leaving	1
the	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
Varya	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
began	1
immediately	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
what	1
interested	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
more	1
excited	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
her	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
mean	1
and	1
hateful	1
and	1
Madame	1
Kartasova	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
she	1
began	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
What	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
heard	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
person	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
it	1
There	1
isn	1
t	1
a	1
more	1
spiteful	1
creature	1
than	1
that	1
Madame	1
Kartasova	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
she	1
do	1
My	1
husband	1
told	1
me	1
She	1
has	1
insulted	1
Madame	1
Karenina	1
Her	1
husband	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
across	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
Madame	1
Kartasova	1
made	1
a	1
scene	1
She	1
said	1
something	1
aloud	1
he	1
says	1
something	1
insulting	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
Count	1
your	1
maman	1
is	1
asking	1
for	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
peeping	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
expecting	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
said	1
his	1
mother	1
smiling	1
sarcastically	1
You	1
were	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
Her	1
son	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
Good	1
evening	1
maman	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
coldly	1
Why	1

to	1

Madame	1

went	1

when	1

had	1
moved	1
away	1
Elle	1

On	1

Maman	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
answered	1
scowling	1
I	1
m	1
only	1
saying	1
what	1
everyone	1
s	1
saying	1
Vronsky	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
saying	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
met	1
his	1
brother	1
Ah	1
Alexey	1
said	1
his	1
brother	1
How	1
disgusting	1
Idiot	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
nothing	1
else	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
Let	1
s	1
go	1
together	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
With	1
rapid	1
steps	1
he	1
went	1
downstairs	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
Anger	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
having	1
put	1
herself	1
and	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
false	1
position	1
together	1
with	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
suffering	1
filled	1
his	1
heart	1
He	1
went	1
down	1
and	1
made	1
straight	1
for	1
Anna	1
s	1
box	1
At	1
her	1
box	1
stood	1
Stremov	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
tenors	1
Le	1
moule	1

bris'e	1
	1
Vronsky	1
bowed	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
greet	1
Stremov	1
You	1
came	1
in	1
late	1
I	1
think	1
and	1
have	1
missed	1
the	1
best	1
song	1
Anna	1
said	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
glancing	1
ironically	1
he	1
thought	1
at	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
poor	1
judge	1
of	1
music	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
Like	1
Prince	1
Yashvin	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
who	1
considers	1
that	1
Patti	1
sings	1
too	1
loud	1
Thank	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
her	1
little	1
hand	1
in	1
its	1
long	1
glove	1
taking	1
the	1
playbill	1
Vronsky	1
picked	1
up	1
and	1
suddenly	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
her	1
lovely	1
face	1
quivered	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
Noticing	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
act	1
that	1
her	1
box	1
was	1
empty	1
Vronsky	1
rousing	1
indignant	1
hushes	1
in	1
the	1
silent	1
audience	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
solo	1
and	1
drove	1
home	1
Anna	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
home	1
When	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
dress	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
at	1
the	1
theater	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
armchair	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
resumed	1
her	1
former	1
position	1
Anna	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything	1
she	1
cried	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
hatred	1
in	1
her	1
voice	1
getting	1
up	1
I	1
begged	1
I	1
implored	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unpleasant	1
Unpleasant	1
she	1
cried	1
hideous	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
it	1
She	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
disgrace	1
to	1
sit	1
beside	1
me	1
A	1
silly	1
woman	1
s	1
chatter	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
why	1
risk	1
it	1
why	1
provoke	1
I	1
hate	1
your	1
calm	1
You	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
loved	1
me	1
Anna	1
How	1
does	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
come	1
in	1
Oh	1
if	1
you	1
loved	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
tortured	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
terror	1
He	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
angry	1
notwithstanding	1
He	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
means	1
of	1
soothing	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reproach	1
her	1
in	1
words	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
reproached	1
her	1
And	1
the	1
asseverations	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
vulgar	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
utter	1
them	1
she	1
drank	1
in	1
eagerly	1
and	1
gradually	1
became	1
calmer	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
completely	1
reconciled	1
they	1
left	1
for	1
the	1
country	1

Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
spent	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
at	1
Pokrovskoe	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
Kitty	1
Levin	1
s	1
The	1
house	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
estate	1
was	1
quite	1
in	1
ruins	1
and	1
Levin	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
persuaded	1
her	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
summer	1
with	1
them	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
greatly	1
approved	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement	1
He	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
his	1
official	1
duties	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
spending	1
the	1
summer	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
remaining	1
in	1
Moscow	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
Besides	1
the	1
Oblonskys	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
governess	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
too	1
came	1
to	1
stay	1
that	1
summer	1
with	1
the	1
Levins	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
her	1
inexperienced	1
daughter	1
in	1
her	1
interesting	1
condition	1
Moreover	1
Varenka	1
Kitty	1
s	1
friend	1
abroad	1
kept	1
her	1
promise	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Kitty	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
married	1
and	1
stayed	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
All	1
of	1
these	1
were	1
friends	1
or	1
relations	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
wife	1
And	1
though	1
he	1
liked	1
them	1
all	1
he	1
rather	1
regretted	1
his	1
own	1
Levin	1
world	1
and	1
ways	1
which	1
was	1
smothered	1
by	1
this	1
influx	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
element	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
Of	1
his	1
own	1
relations	1
there	1
stayed	1
with	1
him	1
only	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
but	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
Koznishev	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
Levin	1
stamp	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Levin	1
spirit	1
was	1
utterly	1
obliterated	1
In	1
the	1
Levins	1
house	1
so	1
long	1
deserted	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
that	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
were	1
occupied	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
counted	1
them	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
grandson	1
or	1
granddaughter	1
at	1
a	1
separate	1
table	1
And	1
Kitty	1
with	1
her	1
careful	1
housekeeping	1
had	1
no	1
little	1
trouble	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
the	1
chickens	1
turkeys	1
and	1
geese	1
of	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
were	1
needed	1
to	1
satisfy	1
the	1
summer	1
appetites	1
of	1
the	1
visitors	1
and	1
children	1
The	1
whole	1
family	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
dinner	1
Dolly	1
s	1
children	1
with	1
their	1
governess	1
and	1
Varenka	1
were	1
making	1
plans	1
for	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
was	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
for	1
his	1
intellect	1
and	1
learning	1
with	1
a	1
respect	1
that	1
almost	1
amounted	1
to	1
awe	1
surprised	1
everyone	1
by	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
about	1
mushrooms	1
Take	1
me	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
picking	1
mushrooms	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
Varenka	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
occupation	1
Oh	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
coloring	1
a	1
little	1
Kitty	1
exchanged	1
meaningful	1
glances	1
with	1
Dolly	1
The	1
proposal	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
and	1
intellectual	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
to	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
with	1
Varenka	1
confirmed	1
certain	1
theories	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
with	1
which	1
her	1
mind	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
busy	1
of	1
late	1
She	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
address	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
look	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
noticed	1
After	1
dinner	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
at	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
window	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
would	1
start	1
on	1
the	1
mushroom	1
picking	1
expedition	1
Levin	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
near	1
his	1
brother	1
Kitty	1
stood	1
beside	1
her	1
husband	1
evidently	1
awaiting	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
interest	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
something	1
You	1
have	1
changed	1
in	1
many	1
respects	1
since	1
your	1
marriage	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiling	1
to	1
Kitty	1
and	1
obviously	1
little	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
remained	1
true	1
to	1
your	1
passion	1
for	1
defending	1
the	1
most	1
paradoxical	1
theories	1
Katya	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
good	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
stand	1
her	1
husband	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
putting	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
looking	1
significantly	1
at	1
her	1
Oh	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
time	1
either	1
added	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
seeing	1
the	1
children	1
running	1
out	1
At	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
Tanya	1
galloped	1
sideways	1
in	1
her	1
tightly	1
drawn	1
stockings	1
and	1
waving	1
a	1
basket	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
hat	1
she	1
ran	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
Boldly	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes	1
so	1
like	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
fine	1
eyes	1
she	1
handed	1
him	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
for	1
him	1
softening	1
her	1
freedom	1
by	1
a	1
shy	1
and	1
friendly	1
smile	1
Varenka	1
s	1
waiting	1
she	1
said	1
carefully	1
putting	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
seeing	1
from	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
do	1
so	1
Varenka	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
yellow	1
print	1
gown	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
kerchief	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
I	1
m	1
coming	1
I	1

Varvara	1
Andreevna	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
finishing	1
his	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
and	1
putting	1
into	1
their	1
separate	1
pockets	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
cigar	1
case	1
And	1
how	1
sweet	1
my	1
Varenka	1
is	1
eh	1
said	1
Kitty	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
rose	1
She	1
spoke	1
so	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
could	1
hear	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
meant	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
And	1
how	1
good	1
looking	1
she	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
refined	1
beauty	1
Varenka	1
Kitty	1
shouted	1
Shall	1
you	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
mill	1
copse	1
We	1
ll	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
You	1
certainly	1
forget	1
your	1
condition	1
Kitty	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
hurriedly	1
coming	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
You	1
mustn	1
t	1
shout	1
like	1
that	1
Varenka	1
hearing	1
Kitty	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
reprimand	1
went	1
with	1
light	1
rapid	1
steps	1
up	1
to	1
Kitty	1
The	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
movement	1
her	1
flushed	1
and	1
eager	1
face	1
everything	1
betrayed	1
that	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
what	1
this	1
was	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
her	1
intently	1
She	1
called	1
Varenka	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
merely	1
in	1
order	1
mentally	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
blessing	1
for	1
the	1
important	1
event	1
which	1
as	1
Kitty	1
fancied	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
day	1
after	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
Varenka	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
if	1
a	1
certain	1
something	1
were	1
to	1
happen	1
she	1
whispered	1
as	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
And	1
are	1
you	1
coming	1
with	1
us	1
Varenka	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
in	1
confusion	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
I	1
am	1
coming	1
but	1
only	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
stop	1
Why	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
there	1
said	1
Kitty	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
wagons	1
and	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
invoice	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
where	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
On	1
the	1
terrace	1
Chapter	1
2	1
On	1
the	1
terrace	1
were	1
assembled	1
all	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
They	1
always	1
liked	1
sitting	1
there	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
had	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
there	1
too	1
Besides	1
the	1
sewing	1
and	1
knitting	1
of	1
baby	1
clothes	1
with	1
which	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
busy	1
that	1
afternoon	1
jam	1
was	1
being	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
by	1
a	1
method	1
new	1
to	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
without	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
water	1
Kitty	1
had	1
introduced	1
this	1
new	1
method	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
use	1
in	1
her	1
home	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
jam	1
making	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
intrusted	1
considering	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
Levin	1
household	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
amiss	1
had	1
nevertheless	1
put	1
water	1
with	1
the	1
strawberries	1
maintaining	1
that	1
the	1
jam	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
without	1
it	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
making	1
jam	1
before	1
everyone	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
proved	1
to	1
her	1
conclusively	1
that	1
jam	1
could	1
be	1
very	1
well	1
made	1
without	1
water	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
her	1
face	1
heated	1
and	1
angry	1
her	1
hair	1
untidy	1
and	1
her	1
thin	1
arms	1
bare	1
to	1
the	1
elbows	1
was	1
turning	1
the	1
preserving	1
pan	1
over	1
the	1
charcoal	1
stove	1
looking	1
darkly	1
at	1
the	1
raspberries	1
and	1
devoutly	1
hoping	1
they	1
would	1
stick	1
and	1
not	1
cook	1
properly	1
The	1
princess	1
conscious	1
that	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
wrath	1
must	1
be	1
chiefly	1
directed	1
against	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
person	1
responsible	1
for	1
the	1
raspberry	1
jam	1
making	1
tried	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
absorbed	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
and	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
jam	1
talked	1
of	1
other	1
matters	1
but	1
cast	1
stealthy	1
glances	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
stove	1
I	1
always	1
buy	1
my	1
maids	1
dresses	1
myself	1
of	1
some	1
cheap	1
material	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
continuing	1
the	1
previous	1
conversation	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
skim	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
she	1
added	1
addressing	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
There	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
hot	1
for	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
stopping	1
Kitty	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
said	1
Dolly	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
she	1
carefully	1
passed	1
the	1
spoon	1
over	1
the	1
frothing	1
sugar	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
clinging	1
jam	1
from	1
the	1
spoon	1
by	1
knocking	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
plate	1
that	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
yellow	1
red	1
scum	1
and	1
blood	1
colored	1
syrup	1
How	1
they	1
ll	1
enjoy	1
this	1
at	1
tea	1
time	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
children	1
remembering	1
how	1
she	1
herself	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
had	1
wondered	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
eat	1
what	1
was	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
scum	1
of	1
the	1
jam	1
Stiva	1
says	1
it	1
s	1
much	1
better	1
to	1
give	1
money	1
Dolly	1
took	1
up	1
meanwhile	1
the	1
weighty	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
what	1
presents	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
servants	1
But	1
Money	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Kitty	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
They	1
appreciate	1
a	1
present	1
Well	1
last	1
year	1
for	1
instance	1
I	1
bought	1
our	1
Matrona	1
Semyenovna	1
not	1
a	1
poplin	1
but	1
something	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
I	1
remember	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
it	1
on	1
your	1
nameday	1
A	1
charming	1
pattern	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
refined	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
it	1
myself	1
if	1
she	1
hadn	1
t	1
had	1
it	1
Something	1
like	1
Varenka	1
s	1
So	1
pretty	1
and	1
inexpensive	1
Well	1
now	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
done	1
said	1
Dolly	1
dropping	1
the	1

angrily	1
It	1

added	1
Ah	1
how	1

Kitty	1
said	1
suddenly	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
sparrow	1
that	1
had	1
settled	1
on	1
the	1
step	1
and	1
was	1
pecking	1
at	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
a	1
raspberry	1
Yes	1
but	1
you	1
keep	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
stove	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
`A	1

Varenka	1
said	1
Kitty	1
speaking	1
in	1
French	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
so	1
that	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
should	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
you	1
know	1
mamma	1
I	1
somehow	1
expect	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
settled	1
today	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
How	1
splendid	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
famous	1
matchmaker	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
Dolly	1
How	1
carefully	1
and	1
cleverly	1
she	1
throws	1
them	1
together	1
No	1
tell	1
me	1
mamma	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
think	1
He	1
he	1
meant	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
anyone	1
in	1
Russia	1
now	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
still	1
I	1
know	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
girls	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
marry	1
him	1
even	1
now	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
girl	1
but	1
he	1
might	1
Oh	1
no	1
mamma	1
do	1
understand	1
why	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
too	1
nothing	1
better	1
could	1
be	1
imagined	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
she	1
s	1
charming	1
said	1
Kitty	1
crooking	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
fingers	1
He	1
thinks	1
her	1
very	1
attractive	1
that	1
s	1
certain	1
assented	1
Dolly	1
Then	1
he	1
occupies	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
either	1
fortune	1
or	1
position	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
All	1
he	1
needs	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
sweet	1
wife	1
a	1
restful	1
one	1
Well	1
with	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
restful	1
Dolly	1
assented	1
Thirdly	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
love	1
him	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
is	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
splendid	1
I	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
seeing	1
them	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
everything	1
settled	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
their	1
eyes	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
delighted	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
Dolly	1
But	1
don	1
t	1
excite	1
yourself	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
excited	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
Oh	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
excited	1
mamma	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
today	1
Ah	1
that	1
s	1
so	1
strange	1
how	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
makes	1
an	1
offer	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
barrier	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
s	1
broken	1
down	1
said	1
Dolly	1
smiling	1
pensively	1
and	1
recalling	1
her	1
past	1
with	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Mamma	1
how	1
did	1
papa	1
make	1
you	1
an	1
offer	1
Kitty	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
simple	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
beamed	1
all	1
over	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
Oh	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
You	1
loved	1
him	1
anyway	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
a	1
peculiar	1
pleasure	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
now	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
on	1
equal	1
terms	1
about	1
those	1
questions	1
of	1
such	1
paramount	1
interest	1
in	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
life	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
did	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
But	1
how	1
was	1
it	1
settled	1
between	1
you	1
mamma	1
You	1
imagine	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
invented	1
something	1
quite	1
new	1
It	1
s	1
always	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
by	1
the	1
eyes	1
by	1
smiles	1
How	1
nicely	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
mamma	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
by	1
the	1
eyes	1
by	1
smiles	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
done	1
Dolly	1
assented	1
But	1
what	1
words	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
What	1
did	1
Kostya	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
He	1
wrote	1
it	1
in	1
chalk	1
It	1
was	1
wonderful	1
How	1
long	1
ago	1
it	1
seems	1
she	1
said	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
women	1
all	1
fell	1
to	1
musing	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
Kitty	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
silence	1
She	1
remembered	1
all	1
that	1
last	1
winter	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
and	1
her	1
passion	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
There	1
s	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
old	1
love	1
affair	1
of	1
Varenka	1
s	1
she	1
said	1
a	1
natural	1
chain	1
of	1
ideas	1
bringing	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
point	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
They	1
re	1
all	1
all	1
men	1
I	1
mean	1
she	1
added	1
awfully	1
jealous	1
over	1
our	1
past	1
Not	1
all	1
said	1
Dolly	1
You	1
judge	1
by	1
your	1
own	1
husband	1
It	1
makes	1
him	1
miserable	1
even	1
now	1
to	1
remember	1
Vronsky	1
Eh	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
Yes	1
Kitty	1
answered	1
a	1
pensive	1
smile	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
But	1
I	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
the	1
mother	1
put	1
in	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
her	1
motherly	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
daughter	1
what	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
your	1
past	1
that	1
could	1
worry	1
him	1
That	1
Vronsky	1
paid	1
you	1
attentions	1
that	1
happens	1
to	1
every	1
girl	1
Oh	1
yes	1
but	1
we	1
didn	1
t	1
mean	1
that	1
Kitty	1
said	1
flushing	1
a	1
little	1
No	1
let	1
me	1
speak	1
her	1
mother	1
went	1
on	1
why	1
you	1
yourself	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
remember	1
Oh	1
mamma	1
said	1
Kitty	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
suffering	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
keeping	1
you	1
young	1
people	1
in	1
check	1
nowadays	1
Your	1
friendship	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
beyond	1
what	1
was	1
suitable	1
I	1
should	1
myself	1
have	1
called	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
explain	1
himself	1
But	1
my	1
darling	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
agitated	1
Please	1
remember	1
that	1
and	1
calm	1
yourself	1
I	1
m	1
perfectly	1
calm	1
maman	1
How	1
happy	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Kitty	1
that	1
Anna	1
came	1
then	1
said	1
Dolly	1
and	1
how	1
unhappy	1
for	1
her	1
It	1
turned	1
out	1
quite	1
the	1
opposite	1
she	1
said	1
struck	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
ideas	1
Then	1
Anna	1
was	1
so	1
happy	1
and	1
Kitty	1
thought	1
herself	1
unhappy	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
opposite	1
I	1
often	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
A	1
nice	1
person	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
Horrid	1
repulsive	1
woman	1
no	1
heart	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
Kitty	1
had	1
married	1
not	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
Levin	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
Kitty	1
said	1
with	1
annoyance	1
I	1
never	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
catching	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
well	1
known	1
step	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
terrace	1
What	1
s	1
that	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
inquired	1
Levin	1
coming	1
onto	1
the	1
terrace	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
repeat	1
the	1
question	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
I	1
ve	1
broken	1
in	1
on	1
your	1
feminine	1
parliament	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
round	1
on	1
everyone	1
discontentedly	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
something	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
before	1
him	1
For	1
a	1
second	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sharing	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
vexation	1
at	1
their	1
making	1
jam	1
without	1
water	1
and	1
altogether	1
at	1
the	1
outside	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
element	1
He	1
smiled	1
however	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Well	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
everyone	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
now	1
Oh	1
very	1
well	1
said	1
Kitty	1
smiling	1
and	1
how	1
have	1
things	1
gone	1
with	1
you	1
The	1
wagons	1
held	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
carts	1
did	1
Well	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
I	1
ve	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
What	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
Kitty	1
in	1
the	1
wagonette	1
her	1
mother	1
said	1
reproachfully	1
Yes	1
at	1
a	1
walking	1
pace	1
princess	1
Levin	1
never	1
called	1
the	1
princess	1
maman	1
as	1
men	1
often	1
do	1
call	1
their	1
mothers	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
disliked	1
his	1
not	1
doing	1
so	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
respected	1
the	1
princess	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
call	1
her	1
so	1
without	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
profaning	1
his	1
feeling	1
for	1
his	1
dead	1
mother	1
Come	1
with	1
us	1
maman	1
said	1
Kitty	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
imprudence	1
Well	1
I	1
ll	1
walk	1
then	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
well	1
Kitty	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
You	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
but	1
everything	1
in	1
moderation	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Well	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
is	1
the	1
jam	1
done	1
said	1
Levin	1
smiling	1
to	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
cheer	1
her	1
up	1
Is	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
way	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
For	1
our	1
notions	1
it	1
s	1
boiled	1
too	1
long	1
It	1
ll	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
mildew	1
even	1
though	1
our	1
ice	1
has	1
begun	1
to	1
thaw	1
already	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
ve	1
no	1
cool	1
cellar	1
to	1
store	1
it	1
said	1
Kitty	1
at	1
once	1
divining	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
motive	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
old	1
housekeeper	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
but	1
your	1
pickle	1
s	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
mamma	1
says	1
she	1
never	1
tasted	1
any	1
like	1
it	1
she	1
added	1
smiling	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
kerchief	1
straight	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
Kitty	1
You	1
needn	1
t	1
try	1
to	1
console	1
me	1
mistress	1
I	1
need	1
only	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
happy	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
rough	1
familiarity	1
of	1
that	1
with	1
him	1
touched	1
Kitty	1
Come	1
along	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
you	1
will	1
show	1
us	1
the	1
best	1
places	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
smiled	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
you	1
too	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
Do	1
it	1
please	1
by	1
my	1
receipt	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
put	1
some	1
paper	1
over	1
the	1
jam	1
and	1
moisten	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
rum	1
and	1
without	1
even	1
ice	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
go	1
mildewy	1
Chapter	1
3	1
Kitty	1
was	1
particularly	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
mortification	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
always	1
so	1
quick	1
to	1
reflect	1
every	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
onto	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
and	1
had	1
got	1
no	1
answer	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
off	1
on	1
foot	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
onto	1
the	1
beaten	1
dusty	1
road	1
marked	1
with	1
rusty	1
wheels	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
grains	1
of	1
corn	1
she	1
clung	1
faster	1
to	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
closer	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
the	1
momentary	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
and	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
approaching	1
motherhood	1
was	1
never	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
absent	1
from	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
delicious	1
bliss	1
quite	1
pure	1
from	1
all	1
alloy	1
of	1
sense	1
in	1
the	1
being	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
speech	1
yet	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
which	1
like	1
her	1
eyes	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
child	1
In	1
her	1
voice	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
softness	1
and	1
gravity	1
which	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
people	1
continually	1
concentrated	1
on	1
some	1
cherished	1
pursuit	1
So	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
tired	1
Lean	1
more	1
on	1
me	1
said	1
he	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
alone	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
though	1
I	1
m	1
happy	1
with	1
them	1
I	1
do	1
regret	1
our	1
winter	1
evenings	1
alone	1
That	1
was	1
good	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
even	1
better	1
Both	1
are	1
better	1
he	1
said	1
squeezing	1
her	1
hand	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
in	1
About	1
jam	1
Oh	1
yes	1
about	1
jam	1
too	1
but	1
afterwards	1
about	1
how	1
men	1
make	1
offers	1
Ah	1
said	1
Levin	1
listening	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
paying	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
which	1
passed	1
now	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
avoiding	1
places	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
make	1
a	1
false	1
step	1
And	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Varenka	1
You	1
ve	1
noticed	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
anxious	1
for	1
it	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
she	1
peeped	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
Levin	1
answered	1
smiling	1
Sergey	1
seems	1
very	1
strange	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
you	1
know	1
Yes	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
girl	1
who	1
died	1
That	1
was	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
it	1
from	1
hearsay	1
and	1
tradition	1
I	1
remember	1
him	1
then	1
He	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
sweet	1
But	1
I	1
ve	1
watched	1
him	1
since	1
with	1
women	1
he	1
is	1
friendly	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
likes	1
but	1
one	1
feels	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
re	1
simply	1
people	1
not	1
women	1
Yes	1
but	1
now	1
with	1
Varenka	1
I	1
fancy	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
Perhaps	1
there	1
is	1
But	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
peculiar	1
wonderful	1
person	1
He	1
lives	1
a	1
spiritual	1
life	1
only	1
He	1
s	1
too	1
pure	1
too	1
exalted	1
a	1
nature	1
Why	1
Would	1
this	1
lower	1
him	1
then	1
No	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
a	1
spiritual	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
with	1
actual	1
fact	1
and	1
Varenka	1
is	1
after	1
all	1
fact	1
Levin	1
had	1
grown	1
used	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
uttering	1
his	1
thought	1
boldly	1
without	1
taking	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
clothing	1
it	1
in	1
exact	1
language	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
such	1
moments	1
of	1
loving	1
tenderness	1
as	1
now	1
would	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
from	1
a	1
hint	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
understand	1
him	1
Yes	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
actual	1
fact	1
about	1
her	1
as	1
about	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
cared	1
for	1
me	1
She	1
is	1
altogether	1
spiritual	1
Oh	1
no	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
so	1
glad	1
when	1
my	1
people	1
like	1
you	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
very	1
nice	1
to	1
me	1
but	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
poor	1
Nikolay	1
you	1
really	1
cared	1
for	1
each	1
other	1
Levin	1
finished	1
Why	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
added	1
I	1
sometimes	1
blame	1
myself	1
for	1
not	1
it	1
ends	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
forgetting	1
Ah	1
how	1
terrible	1
and	1
dear	1
he	1
was	1
Yes	1
what	1
were	1
we	1
talking	1
about	1
Levin	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
You	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
said	1
Kitty	1
translating	1
into	1
her	1
own	1
language	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
Levin	1
said	1
smiling	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
weakness	1
necessary	1
I	1
ve	1
always	1
envied	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
happy	1
I	1
still	1
envy	1
him	1
You	1
envy	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
I	1
envy	1
him	1
for	1
being	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
said	1
Levin	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
live	1
for	1
himself	1
His	1
whole	1
life	1
is	1
subordinated	1
to	1
his	1
duty	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
contented	1
And	1
you	1
Kitty	1
asked	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
and	1
loving	1
smile	1
She	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
explained	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
smile	1
but	1
the	1
last	1
link	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
exalting	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
abasing	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
sincere	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
insincerity	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
from	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
at	1
being	1
too	1
happy	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
from	1
his	1
unflagging	1
craving	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
she	1
loved	1
it	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
smiled	1
And	1
you	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
she	1
asked	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
Her	1
disbelief	1
in	1
his	1
self	1
dissatisfaction	1
delighted	1
him	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
giving	1
utterance	1
to	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
her	1
disbelief	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
but	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
myself	1
he	1
said	1
Why	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
yourself	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
Well	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
In	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
really	1
care	1
for	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
stumble	1
see	1
Oh	1
but	1
really	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
skip	1
about	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
breaking	1
off	1
to	1
scold	1
her	1
for	1
too	1
agile	1
a	1
movement	1
in	1
stepping	1
over	1
a	1
branch	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
think	1
about	1
myself	1
and	1
compare	1
myself	1
with	1
others	1
especially	1
with	1
my	1
brother	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
poor	1
creature	1
But	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
Kitty	1
pursued	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
too	1
work	1
for	1
others	1
What	1
about	1
your	1
co	1
operative	1
settlement	1
and	1
your	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
and	1
your	1
book	1
Oh	1
but	1
I	1
feel	1
and	1
particularly	1
just	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
your	1
fault	1
he	1
said	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
doesn	1
t	1
count	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
halfheartedly	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
care	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
Instead	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
like	1
a	1
task	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
me	1
Well	1
what	1
would	1
you	1
say	1
about	1
papa	1
asked	1
Kitty	1
Is	1
he	1
a	1
poor	1
creature	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
He	1
no	1
But	1
then	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
simplicity	1
the	1
straightforwardness	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
got	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
I	1
fret	1
about	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
your	1
doing	1
Before	1
there	1
was	1
you	1
and	1
this	1
too	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
towards	1
her	1
waist	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
I	1
put	1
all	1
my	1
energies	1
into	1
work	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
ashamed	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
task	1
set	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
pretending	1
Well	1
but	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
change	1
this	1
minute	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
said	1
Kitty	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
task	1
set	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
and	1
nothing	1
else	1
Of	1
course	1
not	1
said	1
Levin	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
happy	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
anything	1
So	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
ll	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
today	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
silence	1
I	1
think	1
so	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
so	1
Only	1
I	1
m	1
awfully	1
anxious	1
for	1
it	1
Here	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
She	1
stooped	1
down	1
and	1
picked	1
a	1
wild	1
camomile	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
path	1
Come	1
count	1
he	1
does	1
propose	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
flower	1
He	1
does	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
said	1
Levin	1
tearing	1
off	1
the	1
white	1
petals	1
No	1
no	1
Kitty	1
snatching	1
at	1
his	1
hand	1
stopped	1
him	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
his	1
fingers	1
with	1
interest	1
You	1
picked	1
off	1
two	1
Oh	1
but	1
see	1
this	1
little	1
one	1
shan	1
t	1
count	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
said	1
Levin	1
tearing	1
off	1
a	1
little	1
half	1
grown	1
petal	1
Here	1
s	1
the	1
wagonette	1
overtaking	1
us	1
Aren	1
t	1
you	1
tired	1
Kitty	1
called	1
the	1
princess	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
in	1
as	1
the	1
horses	1
are	1
quiet	1
and	1
walking	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
they	1
were	1
quite	1
near	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
all	1
walked	1
on	1
together	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Varenka	1
with	1
her	1
white	1
kerchief	1
on	1
her	1
black	1
hair	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
children	1
gaily	1
and	1
good	1
humoredly	1
looking	1
after	1
them	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
visibly	1
excited	1
at	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
receiving	1
a	1
declaration	1
from	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
cared	1
for	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
walked	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
never	1
left	1
off	1
admiring	1
her	1
Looking	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
delightful	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
he	1
knew	1
about	1
her	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
conscious	1
that	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
something	1
special	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
long	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
only	1
once	1
in	1
his	1
early	1
youth	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
happiness	1
in	1
being	1
near	1
her	1
continually	1
grew	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
huge	1
slender	1
stalked	1
agaric	1
fungus	1
in	1
her	1
basket	1
he	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
flush	1
of	1
glad	1
and	1
alarmed	1
excitement	1
that	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
he	1
was	1
confused	1
himself	1
and	1
smiled	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
silence	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
said	1
too	1
much	1
If	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
like	1
a	1
boy	1
to	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
pick	1
by	1
myself	1
apart	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
or	1
else	1
my	1
efforts	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
show	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
on	1
low	1
silky	1
grass	1
between	1
old	1
birch	1
trees	1
standing	1
far	1
apart	1
and	1
went	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
where	1
between	1
the	1
white	1
birch	1
trunks	1
there	1
were	1
gray	1
trunks	1
of	1
aspen	1
and	1
dark	1
bushes	1
of	1
hazel	1
Walking	1
some	1
forty	1
paces	1
away	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
knowing	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
stood	1
still	1
behind	1
a	1
bushy	1
spindle	1
tree	1
in	1
full	1
flower	1
with	1
its	1
rosy	1
red	1
catkins	1
It	1
was	1
perfectly	1
still	1
all	1
round	1
him	1
Only	1
overhead	1
in	1
the	1
birches	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
stood	1
the	1
flies	1
like	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
bees	1
buzzed	1
unceasingly	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
voices	1
were	1
floated	1
across	1
to	1
him	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
heard	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Varenka	1
s	1
contralto	1
voice	1
calling	1
Grisha	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
passed	1
over	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
face	1
Conscious	1
of	1
this	1
smile	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
condition	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
cigar	1
he	1
began	1
lighting	1
it	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
a	1
match	1
to	1
light	1
against	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
tree	1
The	1
soft	1
scales	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
bark	1
rubbed	1
off	1
the	1
phosphorus	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
went	1
out	1
At	1
last	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
matches	1
burned	1
and	1
the	1
fragrant	1
cigar	1
smoke	1
hovering	1
uncertainly	1
in	1
flat	1
wide	1
coils	1
stretched	1
away	1
forwards	1
and	1
upwards	1
over	1
a	1
bush	1
under	1
the	1
overhanging	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
birch	1
tree	1
Watching	1
the	1
streak	1
of	1
smoke	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
walked	1
gently	1
on	1
deliberating	1
on	1
his	1
position	1
Why	1
not	1
he	1
thought	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
a	1
passing	1
fancy	1
or	1
a	1
passion	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
this	1
attraction	1
this	1
mutual	1
attraction	1
I	1
can	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
mutual	1
attraction	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
contradiction	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
bent	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
if	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
this	1
attraction	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
my	1
vocation	1
and	1
my	1
duty	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
against	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
lost	1
Marie	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
remain	1
faithful	1
to	1
her	1
memory	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
against	1
my	1
feeling	1
That	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
this	1
consideration	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
importance	1
for	1
him	1
personally	1
but	1
would	1
only	1
perhaps	1
detract	1
from	1
his	1
romantic	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
others	1
But	1
apart	1
from	1
that	1
however	1
much	1
I	1
searched	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
find	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
my	1
feeling	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
choosing	1
by	1
considerations	1
of	1
suitability	1
alone	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
found	1
anything	1
better	1
However	1
many	1
women	1
and	1
girls	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
united	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
all	1
positively	1
all	1
the	1
qualities	1
he	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
She	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
and	1
freshness	1
of	1
youth	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
consciously	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
ought	1
to	1
love	1
that	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
Another	1
point	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
worldly	1
but	1
had	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
distaste	1
for	1
worldly	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
society	1
which	1
were	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
life	1
Thirdly	1
she	1
was	1
religious	1
and	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
unconsciously	1
religious	1
and	1
good	1
as	1
Kitty	1
for	1
example	1
was	1
but	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
founded	1
on	1
religious	1
principles	1
Even	1
in	1
trifling	1
matters	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
found	1
in	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
so	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
bring	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
relations	1
and	1
their	1
influence	1
into	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
house	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
now	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
case	1
She	1
would	1
owe	1
everything	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
desired	1
too	1
for	1
his	1
future	1
family	1
life	1
And	1
this	1
girl	1
who	1
united	1
all	1
these	1
qualities	1
loved	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
modest	1
man	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
it	1
And	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
consideration	1
against	1
it	1
his	1
age	1
But	1
he	1
came	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
lived	1
family	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
gray	1
hair	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him	1
for	1
forty	1
and	1
he	1
remembered	1
Varenka	1
s	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
Russia	1
that	1
men	1
of	1
fifty	1
thought	1
themselves	1
old	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
France	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
fifty	1
considers	1
himself	1
dans	1
la	1
force	1
de	1
l	1
^age	1
while	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
forty	1
is	1
un	1
jeune	1
homme	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
mere	1
reckoning	1
of	1
years	1
matter	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
young	1
in	1
heart	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
youth	1
to	1
feel	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
now	1
when	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
glowing	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
slanting	1
sunbeams	1
the	1
gracious	1
figure	1
of	1
Varenka	1
in	1
her	1
yellow	1
gown	1
with	1
her	1
basket	1
walking	1
lightly	1
by	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
birch	1
tree	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Varenka	1
blended	1
so	1
harmoniously	1
with	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
yellow	1
oatfield	1
lying	1
bathed	1
in	1
the	1
slanting	1
sunshine	1
and	1
beyond	1
it	1
the	1
distant	1
ancient	1
forest	1
flecked	1
with	1
yellow	1
and	1
melting	1
into	1
the	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
His	1
heart	1
throbbed	1
joyously	1
A	1
softened	1
feeling	1
came	1
over	1
him	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
Varenka	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
crouched	1
down	1
to	1
pick	1
a	1
mushroom	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
movement	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
Flinging	1
away	1
the	1
cigar	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
advanced	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps	1
towards	1
her	1
Chapter	1
5	1
Varvara	1
Andreevna	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
young	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
myself	1
the	1
ideal	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
I	1
loved	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
call	1
my	1
wife	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
through	1
a	1
long	1
life	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
what	1
I	1
sought	1
in	1
you	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
hand	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
saying	1
this	1
to	1
himself	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
ten	1
paces	1
from	1
Varvara	1
Kneeling	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
over	1
the	1
mushrooms	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
from	1
Grisha	1
she	1
was	1
calling	1
little	1
Masha	1
Come	1
here	1
little	1
ones	1
There	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
her	1
sweet	1
deep	1
voice	1
Seeing	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
approaching	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
change	1
her	1
position	1
but	1
everything	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
Well	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
some	1
she	1
asked	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
white	1
kerchief	1
turning	1
her	1
handsome	1
gently	1
smiling	1
face	1
to	1
him	1
Not	1
one	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Did	1
you	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
busy	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
who	1
thronged	1
about	1
her	1
That	1
one	1
too	1
near	1
the	1
twig	1
she	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
little	1
Masha	1
a	1
little	1
fungus	1
split	1
in	1
half	1
across	1
its	1
rosy	1
cap	1
by	1
the	1
dry	1
grass	1
from	1
under	1
which	1
it	1
thrust	1
itself	1
Varenka	1
got	1
up	1
while	1
Masha	1
picked	1
the	1
fungus	1
breaking	1
it	1
into	1
two	1
white	1
halves	1
This	1
brings	1
back	1
my	1
childhood	1
she	1
added	1
moving	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
beside	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
They	1
walked	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
steps	1
in	1
silence	1
Varenka	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
speak	1
she	1
guessed	1
of	1
what	1
and	1
felt	1
faint	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
panic	1
They	1
had	1
walked	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
hear	1
them	1
now	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
Varenka	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
After	1
a	1
silence	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
easier	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
after	1
talking	1
about	1
mushrooms	1
But	1
against	1
her	1
own	1
will	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
accidentally	1
Varenka	1
said	1
So	1
you	1
found	1
nothing	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
there	1
are	1
always	1
fewer	1
though	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
He	1
was	1
annoyed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
about	1
the	1
mushrooms	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
uttered	1
about	1
her	1
childhood	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
some	1
length	1
as	1
though	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
observation	1
in	1
response	1
to	1
her	1
last	1
words	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
edible	1
funguses	1
are	1
found	1
principally	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
though	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
them	1
apart	1
Some	1
minutes	1
more	1
passed	1
they	1
moved	1
still	1
further	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
were	1
quite	1
alone	1
Varenka	1
s	1
heart	1
throbbed	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
heard	1
it	1
beating	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
turning	1
red	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
red	1
again	1
To	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
Koznishev	1
after	1
her	1
position	1
with	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
was	1
to	1
her	1
imagination	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
happiness	1
Besides	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
certain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
And	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
She	1
felt	1
frightened	1
She	1
dreaded	1
both	1
his	1
speaking	1
and	1
his	1
not	1
speaking	1
Now	1
or	1
never	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
felt	1
too	1
Everything	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
the	1
flushed	1
cheeks	1
and	1
the	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
of	1
Varenka	1
betrayed	1
a	1
painful	1
suspense	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
saw	1
it	1
and	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
He	1
felt	1
even	1
that	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
slight	1
to	1
her	1
Rapidly	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
he	1
ran	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
arguments	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
decision	1
He	1
even	1
said	1
over	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
offer	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
those	1
words	1
some	1
utterly	1
unexpected	1
reflection	1
that	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
made	1
him	1
ask	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
birch	1
mushroom	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
mushroom	1
Varenka	1
s	1
lips	1
quivered	1
with	1
emotion	1
as	1
she	1
answered	1
In	1
the	1
top	1
part	1
there	1
is	1
scarcely	1
any	1
difference	1
it	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
stalk	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
said	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
and	1
their	1
emotion	1
which	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
then	1
been	1
continually	1
growing	1
more	1
intense	1
began	1
to	1
subside	1
The	1
birch	1
mushroom	1
s	1
stalk	1
suggests	1
a	1
dark	1
man	1
s	1
chin	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
without	1
shaving	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
speaking	1
quite	1
calmly	1
now	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
answered	1
Varenka	1
smiling	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
their	1
walk	1
changed	1
They	1
began	1
to	1
turn	1
towards	1
the	1
children	1
Varenka	1
felt	1
both	1
sore	1
and	1
ashamed	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
home	1
again	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
subject	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
thought	1
his	1
previous	1
decision	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
mistaken	1
one	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Marie	1
Gently	1
children	1
gently	1
Levin	1
shouted	1
quite	1
angrily	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
standing	1
before	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
protect	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
children	1
flew	1
with	1
shrieks	1
of	1
delight	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
Behind	1
the	1
children	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Varenka	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
Kitty	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
Varenka	1
she	1
saw	1
from	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
somewhat	1
crestfallen	1
faces	1
of	1
both	1
that	1
her	1
plans	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
off	1
Well	1
her	1
husband	1
questioned	1
her	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
home	1
again	1
It	1
doesn	1
t	1
bite	1
said	1
Kitty	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
recalling	1
her	1
father	1
a	1
likeness	1
Levin	1
often	1
noticed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
How	1
doesn	1
t	1
bite	1
I	1
ll	1
show	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
taking	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
hand	1
lifting	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mouth	1
and	1
just	1
faintly	1
brushing	1
it	1
with	1
closed	1
lips	1
Like	1
a	1
kiss	1
on	1
a	1
priest	1
s	1
hand	1
Which	1
didn	1
t	1
it	1
bite	1
with	1
he	1
said	1
laughing	1
Both	1
But	1
it	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
like	1
this	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
peasants	1
coming	1
Oh	1

Chapter	1
6	1
During	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
tea	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
balcony	1
and	1
talked	1
as	1
though	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
though	1
they	1
all	1
especially	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Varenka	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
happened	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
though	1
negative	1
was	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
importance	1
They	1
both	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
rather	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
after	1
an	1
examination	1
which	1
has	1
left	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
class	1
or	1
shut	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
school	1
forever	1
Everyone	1
present	1
feeling	1
too	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
talked	1
eagerly	1
about	1
extraneous	1
subjects	1
Levin	1
and	1
Kitty	1
were	1
particularly	1
happy	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
their	1
love	1
that	1
evening	1
And	1
their	1
happiness	1
in	1
their	1
love	1
seemed	1
to	1
imply	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
slur	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
they	1
felt	1
a	1
prick	1
of	1
conscience	1
Mark	1
my	1
words	1
Alexander	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
That	1
evening	1
they	1
were	1
expecting	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
by	1
train	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
had	1
written	1
that	1
possibly	1
he	1
might	1
come	1
too	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
why	1
the	1
princess	1
went	1
on	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
young	1
people	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
at	1
first	1
But	1
papa	1
has	1
left	1
us	1
alone	1
We	1
ve	1
never	1
seen	1
him	1
said	1
Kitty	1
Besides	1
we	1
re	1
not	1
young	1
people	1
we	1
re	1
old	1
married	1
people	1
by	1
now	1
Only	1
if	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
come	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
you	1
children	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
sighing	1
mournfully	1
What	1
nonsense	1
mamma	1
both	1
the	1
daughters	1
fell	1
upon	1
her	1
at	1
once	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
is	1
feeling	1
Why	1
now	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
unexpected	1
quiver	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
voice	1
Her	1
daughters	1
were	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
Maman	1
always	1
finds	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
miserable	1
about	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
that	1
glance	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
happy	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
useful	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
extremely	1
miserable	1
both	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
account	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
ever	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
married	1
their	1
last	1
and	1
favorite	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
home	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
empty	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
Kitty	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
a	1
mysterious	1
air	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
About	1
supper	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
right	1
said	1
Dolly	1
you	1
go	1
and	1
arrange	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
hear	1
Grisha	1
repeat	1
his	1
lesson	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
done	1
all	1
day	1
That	1
s	1
my	1
lesson	1
No	1
Dolly	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
said	1
Levin	1
jumping	1
up	1
Grisha	1
who	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
at	1
a	1
high	1
school	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
holidays	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
studying	1
Latin	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
in	1
Moscow	1
before	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
Levins	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
least	1
once	1
a	1
day	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
lessons	1
of	1
Latin	1
and	1
arithmetic	1
Levin	1
had	1
offered	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
but	1
the	1
mother	1
having	1
once	1
overheard	1
Levin	1
s	1
lesson	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
given	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
teacher	1
in	1
Moscow	1
had	1
given	1
it	1
said	1
resolutely	1
though	1
with	1
much	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
anxiety	1
not	1
to	1
mortify	1
Levin	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
keep	1
strictly	1
to	1
the	1
book	1
as	1
the	1
teacher	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
undertake	1
it	1
again	1
herself	1
Levin	1
was	1
amazed	1
both	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
by	1
neglecting	1
his	1
duty	1
threw	1
upon	1
the	1
mother	1
the	1
supervision	1
of	1
studies	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
comprehension	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
teachers	1
for	1
teaching	1
the	1
children	1
so	1
badly	1
But	1
he	1
promised	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
lessons	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
wished	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
teaching	1
Grisha	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
so	1
took	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
often	1
forgot	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
lesson	1
So	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
today	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
Dolly	1
you	1
sit	1
still	1
he	1
said	1
We	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
all	1
properly	1
like	1
the	1
book	1
Only	1
when	1
Stiva	1
comes	1
and	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
shooting	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
miss	1
it	1
And	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
Grisha	1
Varenka	1
was	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
well	1
ordered	1
household	1
of	1
the	1
Levins	1
Varenka	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
herself	1
useful	1
I	1
ll	1
see	1
to	1
the	1
supper	1
you	1
sit	1
still	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
Yes	1
yes	1
most	1
likely	1
they	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
chickens	1
If	1
so	1
ours	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
Varenka	1
vanished	1
with	1
her	1
What	1
a	1
nice	1
girl	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Not	1
nice	1
maman	1
she	1
s	1
an	1
exquisite	1
girl	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
like	1
her	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
expecting	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
today	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
evidently	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
conversation	1
about	1
Varenka	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
two	1
sons	1
in	1
law	1
more	1
unlike	1
than	1
yours	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
One	1
all	1
movement	1
only	1
living	1
in	1
society	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
in	1
water	1
the	1
other	1
our	1
Kostya	1
lively	1
alert	1
quick	1
in	1
everything	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
society	1
he	1
either	1
sinks	1
into	1
apathy	1
or	1
struggles	1
helplessly	1
like	1
a	1
fish	1
on	1
land	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
very	1
heedless	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
addressing	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
indeed	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
her	1
she	1
indicated	1
Kitty	1
to	1
stay	1
here	1
that	1
she	1
positively	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
Moscow	1
He	1
talks	1
of	1
getting	1
a	1
doctor	1
down	1
Maman	1
he	1
ll	1
do	1
everything	1
he	1
has	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything	1
Kitty	1
said	1
angry	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
for	1
appealing	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
to	1
judge	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
matter	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
snorting	1
of	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
on	1
the	1
gravel	1
Dolly	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
meet	1
her	1
husband	1
when	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
below	1
where	1
Grisha	1
was	1
having	1
his	1
lesson	1
Levin	1
leaped	1
out	1
and	1
helped	1
Grisha	1
out	1
after	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
Stiva	1
Levin	1
shouted	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
balcony	1
We	1
ve	1
finished	1
Dolly	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
afraid	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
started	1
running	1
like	1
a	1
boy	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
carriage	1
Is	1
ea	1
id	1
ejus	1
ejus	1
ejus	1
	1
shouted	1
Grisha	1
skipping	1
along	1
the	1
avenue	1
And	1
someone	1
else	1
too	1
Papa	1
of	1
course	1
cried	1
Levin	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
Kitty	1
don	1
t	1
come	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
staircase	1
go	1
round	1
But	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken	1
in	1
taking	1
the	1
person	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
As	1
he	1
got	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
saw	1
beside	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
not	1
the	1
prince	1
but	1
a	1
handsome	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
Scotch	1
cap	1
with	1
long	1
ends	1
of	1
ribbon	1
behind	1
This	1
was	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
a	1
distant	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
Shtcherbatskys	1
a	1
brilliant	1
young	1
gentleman	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
Moscow	1
society	1
A	1
capital	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
keen	1
sportsman	1
as	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
introducing	1
him	1
Not	1
a	1
whit	1
abashed	1
by	1
the	1
disappointment	1
caused	1
by	1
his	1
having	1
come	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
Veslovsky	1
greeted	1
Levin	1
gaily	1
claiming	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
snatching	1
up	1
Grisha	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
lifted	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
pointer	1
that	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
but	1
walked	1
behind	1
He	1
was	1
rather	1
vexed	1
at	1
the	1
non	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
saw	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
this	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
a	1
quite	1
uncongenial	1
and	1
superfluous	1
person	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
still	1
more	1
uncongenial	1
and	1
superfluous	1
when	1
on	1
approaching	1
the	1
steps	1
where	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
children	1
and	1
grown	1
up	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
much	1
excitement	1
Levin	1
saw	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
with	1
a	1
particularly	1
warm	1
and	1
gallant	1
air	1
kissing	1
Kitty	1
s	1
hand	1
Your	1
wife	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
cousins	1
and	1
very	1
old	1
friends	1
said	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
once	1
more	1
shaking	1
Levin	1
s	1
hand	1
with	1
great	1
warmth	1
Well	1
are	1
there	1
plenty	1
of	1
birds	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
hardly	1
leaving	1
time	1
for	1
everyone	1
to	1
utter	1
their	1
greetings	1
We	1
ve	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
savage	1
intentions	1
Why	1
maman	1
they	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
Moscow	1
since	1
Look	1
Tanya	1
here	1
s	1
something	1
for	1
you	1
Get	1
it	1
please	1
it	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
behind	1
he	1
talked	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
How	1
pretty	1
you	1
ve	1
grown	1
Dolly	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
once	1
more	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
holding	1
it	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
patting	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
Levin	1
who	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
happiest	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
now	1
looked	1
darkly	1
at	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything	1
displeased	1
him	1
Who	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
kissed	1
yesterday	1
with	1
those	1
lips	1
he	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
tender	1
demonstrations	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolly	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
her	1
either	1
She	1
doesn	1
t	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
So	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
so	1
pleased	1
about	1
Revolting	1
thought	1
Levin	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
welcomed	1
this	1
Vassenka	1
with	1
his	1

just	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
Even	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
too	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
unpleasant	1
with	1
the	1
show	1
of	1
cordiality	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
met	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
though	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
neither	1
liked	1
nor	1
respected	1
Oblonsky	1
And	1
Varenka	1
even	1
she	1
seemed	1
hateful	1
with	1
her	1
air	1
sainte	1
nitouche	1
making	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
this	1
gentleman	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
getting	1
married	1
And	1
more	1
hateful	1
than	1
anyone	1
was	1
Kitty	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
gaiety	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
gentleman	1
regarded	1
his	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
holiday	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
everyone	1
else	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
unpleasant	1
was	1
that	1
particular	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
smile	1
Noisily	1
talking	1
they	1
all	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
seated	1
Levin	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
Kitty	1
saw	1
something	1
was	1
wrong	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
seize	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
alone	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
saying	1
he	1
was	1
wanted	1
at	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
his	1
own	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
estate	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
holiday	1
for	1
them	1
he	1
thought	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
no	1
holiday	1
matters	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
wait	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
living	1
without	1
them	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Levin	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
only	1
when	1
they	1
sent	1
to	1
summon	1
him	1
to	1
supper	1
On	1
the	1
stairs	1
were	1
standing	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
consulting	1
about	1
wines	1
for	1
supper	1
But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
making	1
all	1
this	1
fuss	1
Have	1
what	1
we	1
usually	1
do	1
No	1
Stiva	1
doesn	1
t	1
drink	1
Kostya	1
stop	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
matter	1
Kitty	1
began	1
hurrying	1
after	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
strode	1
ruthlessly	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
lively	1
general	1
conversation	1
which	1
was	1
being	1
maintained	1
there	1
by	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
shooting	1
tomorrow	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Please	1
do	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
moving	1
to	1
another	1
chair	1
where	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
sideways	1
with	1
one	1
fat	1
leg	1
crossed	1
under	1
him	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
And	1
have	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
shooting	1
yet	1
this	1
year	1
said	1
Levin	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
his	1
leg	1
but	1
speaking	1
with	1
that	1
forced	1
amiability	1
that	1
Kitty	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
answer	1
for	1
our	1
finding	1
grouse	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
snipe	1
Only	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
start	1
early	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
tired	1
Aren	1
t	1
you	1
tired	1
Stiva	1
Me	1
tired	1
I	1
ve	1
never	1
been	1
tired	1
yet	1
Suppose	1
we	1
stay	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
Let	1
s	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
Yes	1
really	1
let	1
s	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
at	1
all	1
Capital	1
Veslovsky	1
chimed	1
in	1
Oh	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
sleep	1
and	1
keep	1
other	1
people	1
up	1
too	1
Dolly	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
with	1
that	1
faint	1
note	1
of	1
irony	1
in	1
her	1
voice	1
which	1
she	1
almost	1
always	1
had	1
now	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
for	1
bed	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1

No	1
do	1

little	1
Dolly	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
going	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
side	1
behind	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
having	1
supper	1
I	1
ve	1
so	1
much	1
still	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
Nothing	1
really	1
I	1
suppose	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Veslovsky	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
Anna	1
s	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
them	1
again	1
You	1
know	1
they	1
re	1
hardly	1
fifty	1
miles	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
too	1
must	1
certainly	1
go	1
over	1
there	1
Veslovsky	1
come	1
here	1
Vassenka	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Kitty	1
Ah	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
please	1
you	1
have	1
stayed	1
with	1
her	1
How	1
was	1
she	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
appealed	1
to	1
him	1
Levin	1
was	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
though	1
never	1
pausing	1
in	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Varenka	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
eager	1
and	1
mysterious	1
conversation	1
going	1
on	1
between	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Dolly	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
He	1
saw	1
on	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
face	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
real	1
feeling	1
as	1
she	1
gazed	1
with	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
handsome	1
face	1
of	1
Vassenka	1
who	1
was	1
telling	1
them	1
something	1
with	1
great	1
animation	1
It	1
s	1
exceedingly	1
nice	1
at	1
their	1
place	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
telling	1
them	1
about	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
of	1
course	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
house	1
you	1
feel	1
the	1
real	1
feeling	1
of	1
home	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
intend	1
doing	1
I	1
believe	1
they	1
think	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
Moscow	1
How	1
jolly	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
them	1
together	1
When	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
there	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
asked	1
Vassenka	1
I	1
m	1
spending	1
July	1
there	1
Will	1
you	1
go	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
wanting	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
go	1
said	1
Dolly	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
splendid	1
woman	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
alone	1
when	1
you	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
one	1
s	1
way	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
indeed	1
without	1
you	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
And	1
you	1
Kitty	1
I	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
go	1
Kitty	1
said	1
flushing	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
then	1
Veslovsky	1
asked	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
fascinating	1
woman	1
Yes	1
she	1
answered	1
Veslovsky	1
crimsoning	1
still	1
more	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
across	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
shooting	1
then	1
tomorrow	1
she	1
said	1
His	1
jealousy	1
had	1
in	1
these	1
few	1
moments	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
flush	1
that	1
had	1
overspread	1
her	1
cheeks	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
gone	1
far	1
indeed	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
words	1
he	1
construed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
fashion	1
Strange	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
afterwards	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
clear	1
that	1
in	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
shooting	1
all	1
she	1
cared	1
to	1
know	1
was	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
that	1
pleasure	1
to	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
with	1
whom	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
himself	1
No	1
better	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
here	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
Dolly	1
won	1
t	1
see	1
anything	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
said	1
Kitty	1
The	1
motive	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
words	1
was	1
interpreted	1
by	1
Levin	1
thus	1
Don	1
t	1
separate	1
me	1
from	1
him	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
about	1
your	1
going	1
but	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
enjoy	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
this	1
delightful	1
young	1
man	1
Oh	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
we	1
ll	1
stay	1
here	1
tomorrow	1
Levin	1
answered	1
with	1
peculiar	1
amiability	1
Vassenka	1
meanwhile	1
utterly	1
unsuspecting	1
the	1
misery	1
his	1
presence	1
had	1
occasioned	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
after	1
Kitty	1
and	1
watching	1
her	1
with	1
smiling	1
and	1
admiring	1
eyes	1
he	1
followed	1
her	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
look	1
He	1
turned	1
white	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
breathe	1
How	1
dare	1
he	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
wife	1
like	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
boiled	1
within	1
him	1
Tomorrow	1
then	1
Do	1
please	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
said	1
Vassenka	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
again	1
crossing	1
his	1
leg	1
as	1
his	1
habit	1
was	1
Levin	1
s	1
jealousy	1
went	1
further	1
still	1
Already	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
a	1
deceived	1
husband	1
looked	1
upon	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
lover	1
as	1
simply	1
necessary	1
to	1
provide	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
conveniences	1
and	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
polite	1
and	1
hospitable	1
inquiries	1
of	1
Vassenka	1
about	1
his	1
shooting	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
shooting	1
next	1
day	1
Happily	1
for	1
Levin	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
cut	1
short	1
his	1
agonies	1
by	1
getting	1
up	1
herself	1
and	1
advising	1
Kitty	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
But	1
even	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
escape	1
another	1
agony	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
good	1
night	1
to	1
his	1
hostess	1
Vassenka	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
Kitty	1
reddening	1
drew	1
back	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
na"ive	1
bluntness	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
scolded	1
her	1
afterwards	1
We	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
that	1
fashion	1
In	1
Levin	1
s	1
eyes	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
having	1
allowed	1
such	1
relations	1
to	1
arise	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
showing	1
so	1
awkwardly	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
them	1
Why	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
after	1
drinking	1
several	1
glasses	1
of	1
wine	1
at	1
supper	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
most	1
charming	1
and	1
sentimental	1
humor	1
Look	1
Kitty	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
moon	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
risen	1
behind	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
how	1
exquisite	1
Veslovsky	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
a	1
serenade	1
You	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
splendid	1
voice	1
we	1
practiced	1
songs	1
together	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
He	1
has	1
brought	1
some	1
lovely	1
songs	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
new	1
ones	1
Varvara	1
Andreevna	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
sing	1
some	1
duets	1
When	1
the	1
party	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
walked	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
about	1
the	1
avenue	1
with	1
Veslovsky	1
their	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
singing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
songs	1
Levin	1
hearing	1
these	1
voices	1
sat	1
scowling	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
bedroom	1
and	1
maintained	1
an	1
obstinate	1
silence	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
But	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
she	1
hazarded	1
the	1
question	1
Was	1
there	1
perhaps	1
something	1
you	1
disliked	1
about	1
Veslovsky	1
it	1
all	1
burst	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
He	1
was	1
humiliated	1
himself	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
and	1
that	1
exasperated	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
He	1
stood	1
facing	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
glittering	1
menacingly	1
under	1
his	1
scowling	1
brows	1
and	1
he	1
squeezed	1
his	1
strong	1
arms	1
across	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
straining	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
hold	1
himself	1
in	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
grim	1
and	1
even	1
cruel	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
had	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
suffering	1
which	1
touched	1
her	1
His	1
jaws	1
were	1
twitching	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
kept	1
breaking	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
nasty	1
word	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
jealous	1
and	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
feel	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
wounded	1
humiliated	1
that	1
anybody	1
dare	1
think	1
that	1
anybody	1
dare	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
with	1
eyes	1
like	1
that	1
Eyes	1
like	1
what	1
said	1
Kitty	1
trying	1
as	1
conscientiously	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
recall	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
gesture	1
of	1
that	1
evening	1
and	1
every	1
shade	1
implied	1
in	1
them	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
did	1
think	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
something	1
precisely	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
crossed	1
over	1
after	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
own	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
more	1
unable	1
to	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
increase	1
his	1
suffering	1
And	1
what	1
can	1
there	1
possibly	1
be	1
attractive	1
about	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
Ah	1
he	1
cried	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
you	1
shouldn	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
attractive	1
then	1
Oh	1
no	1
Kostya	1
oh	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
oh	1
do	1
listen	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
pained	1
commiseration	1
Why	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
thinking	1
about	1
When	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
no	1
one	1
no	1
one	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
me	1
never	1
to	1
see	1
anyone	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
offended	1
at	1
his	1
jealousy	1
she	1
was	1
angry	1
that	1
the	1
slightest	1
amusement	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
innocent	1
should	1
be	1
forbidden	1
her	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
would	1
readily	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
not	1
merely	1
such	1
trifles	1
but	1
everything	1
for	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
agony	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
You	1
must	1
understand	1
the	1
horror	1
and	1
comedy	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
desperate	1
whisper	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
done	1
nothing	1
improper	1
positively	1
except	1
his	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
airs	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
sits	1
on	1
his	1
legs	1
He	1
thinks	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
form	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
m	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
Kostya	1
you	1
re	1
exaggerating	1
said	1
Kitty	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
shown	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
jealousy	1
The	1
most	1
awful	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
always	1
are	1
and	1
especially	1
now	1
when	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
re	1
something	1
sacred	1
and	1
we	1
re	1
so	1
happy	1
so	1
particularly	1
happy	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
a	1
little	1
wretch	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
wretch	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
abuse	1
him	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
my	1
and	1
your	1
happiness	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
understand	1
now	1
what	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
come	1
from	1
Kitty	1
was	1
beginning	1
Well	1
what	1
what	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
you	1
looked	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
at	1
supper	1
Well	1
well	1
Levin	1
said	1
in	1
dismay	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
about	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
breathless	1
with	1
emotion	1
Levin	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
space	1
then	1
he	1
scanned	1
her	1
pale	1
and	1
distressed	1
face	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
Katya	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
worrying	1
you	1
Darling	1
forgive	1
me	1
It	1
s	1
madness	1
Katya	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
criminal	1
And	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
distressed	1
at	1
such	1
idiocy	1
Oh	1
I	1
was	1
sorry	1
for	1
you	1
For	1
me	1
for	1
me	1
How	1
mad	1
I	1
am	1
But	1
why	1
make	1
you	1
miserable	1
It	1
s	1
awful	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
any	1
outsider	1
can	1
shatter	1
our	1
happiness	1
It	1
s	1
humiliating	1
too	1
of	1
course	1
Oh	1
then	1
I	1
ll	1
keep	1
him	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
summer	1
and	1
will	1
overwhelm	1
him	1
with	1
civility	1
said	1
Levin	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
You	1
shall	1
see	1
Tomorrow	1
Oh	1
yes	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Next	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
up	1
the	1
wagonette	1
and	1
a	1
trap	1
for	1
the	1
shooting	1
party	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
Laska	1
aware	1
since	1
early	1
morning	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
shooting	1
after	1
much	1
whining	1
and	1
darting	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
had	1
sat	1
herself	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
wagonette	1
beside	1
the	1
coachman	1
and	1
disapproving	1
of	1
the	1
delay	1
was	1
excitedly	1
watching	1
the	1
door	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
was	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
in	1
new	1
high	1
boots	1
that	1
reached	1
half	1
way	1
up	1
his	1
thick	1
thighs	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
blouse	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
Russian	1
leather	1
cartridge	1
belt	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
Scotch	1
cap	1
with	1
ribbons	1
with	1
a	1
brand	1
new	1
English	1
gun	1
without	1
a	1
sling	1
Laska	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
welcomed	1
him	1
and	1
jumping	1
up	1
asked	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
whether	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
coming	1
soon	1
but	1
getting	1
no	1
answer	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
post	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
repose	1
again	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
one	1
ear	1
pricked	1
up	1
to	1
listen	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
with	1
a	1
creak	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
spot	1
and	1
tan	1
pointer	1
Krak	1
flew	1
out	1
running	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
himself	1
followed	1
with	1
a	1
gun	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
cigar	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
Good	1
dog	1
good	1
dog	1
Krak	1
he	1
cried	1
encouragingly	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1
who	1
put	1
his	1
paws	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
catching	1
at	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
rough	1
leggings	1
and	1
spats	1
in	1
torn	1
trousers	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
coat	1
On	1
his	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wreck	1
of	1
a	1
hat	1
of	1
indefinite	1
form	1
but	1
his	1
gun	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
patent	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
gem	1
and	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
and	1
cartridge	1
belt	1
though	1
worn	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
quality	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
before	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
truly	1
chic	1
for	1
a	1
sportsman	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
tatters	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
shooting	1
outfit	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
quality	1
He	1
saw	1
it	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
radiant	1
in	1
his	1
rags	1
graceful	1
well	1
fed	1
and	1
joyous	1
a	1
typical	1
Russian	1
nobleman	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
next	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
shooting	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
adopt	1
the	1
same	1
get	1
up	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
about	1
our	1
host	1
he	1
asked	1
A	1
young	1
wife	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
charming	1
one	1
He	1
came	1
down	1
dressed	1
No	1
doubt	1
he	1
s	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
again	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
guessed	1
right	1
Levin	1
had	1
run	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
once	1
more	1
if	1
she	1
forgave	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
idiocy	1
yesterday	1
and	1
moreover	1
to	1
beg	1
her	1
for	1
Christ	1
s	1
sake	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
careful	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
was	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
keep	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
they	1
might	1
any	1
minute	1
push	1
against	1
her	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
declare	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
going	1
away	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
to	1
beg	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
note	1
next	1
morning	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
on	1
horseback	1
to	1
write	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
two	1
words	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
her	1
Kitty	1
was	1
distressed	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
was	1
at	1
parting	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
eager	1
figure	1
looking	1
big	1
and	1
strong	1
in	1
his	1
shooting	1
boots	1
and	1
his	1
white	1
blouse	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
sportsman	1
elation	1
and	1
excitement	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
forgot	1
her	1
own	1
chagrin	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
pleasure	1
and	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
him	1
cheerfully	1
Pardon	1
gentlemen	1
he	1
said	1
running	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
Have	1
you	1
put	1
the	1
lunch	1
in	1
Why	1
is	1
the	1
chestnut	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
Well	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
matter	1
Laska	1
down	1
go	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
Put	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
oxen	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
herdsman	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
some	1
question	1
Excuse	1
me	1
here	1
comes	1
another	1
villain	1
Levin	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wagonette	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
his	1
seat	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
carpenter	1
who	1
came	1
towards	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
a	1
rule	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
yesterday	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
re	1
detaining	1
me	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
Would	1
your	1
honor	1
let	1
me	1
make	1
another	1
turning	1
It	1
s	1
only	1
three	1
steps	1
to	1
add	1
And	1
we	1
make	1
it	1
just	1
fit	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
convenient	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
me	1
Levin	1
answered	1
with	1
annoyance	1
I	1
said	1
Put	1
the	1
lines	1
and	1
then	1
fit	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
Now	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
setting	1
it	1
right	1
Do	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
staircase	1
The	1
point	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
lodge	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
built	1
the	1
carpenter	1
had	1
spoiled	1
the	1
staircase	1
fitting	1
it	1
together	1
without	1
calculating	1
the	1
space	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
fill	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
steps	1
were	1
all	1
sloping	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
place	1
Now	1
the	1
carpenter	1
wanted	1
keeping	1
the	1
same	1
staircase	1
to	1
add	1
three	1
steps	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
But	1
where	1
s	1
your	1
staircase	1
coming	1
out	1
with	1
its	1
three	1
steps	1
Why	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
sir	1
the	1
carpenter	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
smile	1
It	1
comes	1
out	1
right	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
It	1
starts	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
persuasive	1
gesture	1
it	1
comes	1
down	1
and	1
comes	1
down	1
and	1
comes	1
out	1
But	1
three	1
steps	1
will	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
length	1
too	1
where	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
Why	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
ll	1
start	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
so	1
the	1
carpenter	1
said	1
obstinately	1
and	1
convincingly	1
It	1
ll	1
reach	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
Why	1
it	1
ll	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
like	1
this	1
Levin	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
ramrod	1
and	1
began	1
sketching	1
him	1
the	1
staircase	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
There	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
As	1
your	1
honor	1
likes	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
gleam	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
obviously	1
understanding	1
the	1
thing	1
at	1
last	1
It	1
seems	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
Well	1
then	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
told	1
Levin	1
shouted	1
seating	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
wagonette	1
Down	1
Hold	1
the	1
dogs	1
Philip	1
Levin	1
felt	1
now	1
at	1
leaving	1
behind	1
all	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
household	1
cares	1
such	1
an	1
eager	1
sense	1
of	1
joy	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
expectation	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
talk	1
Besides	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
feeling	1
of	1
concentrated	1
excitement	1
that	1
every	1
sportsman	1
experiences	1
as	1
he	1
approaches	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
anything	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
doubt	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
start	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
Kolpensky	1
marsh	1
whether	1
Laska	1
would	1
show	1
to	1
advantage	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
Krak	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
shoot	1
well	1
that	1
day	1
himself	1
Not	1
to	1
disgrace	1
himself	1
before	1
a	1
new	1
spectator	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
outdone	1
by	1
Oblonsky	1
that	1
too	1
was	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
crossed	1
his	1
brain	1
Oblonsky	1
was	1
feeling	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
not	1
talkative	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
kept	1
up	1
alone	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
flow	1
of	1
cheerful	1
chatter	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
Levin	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
unfair	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
Vassenka	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
nice	1
fellow	1
simple	1
good	1
hearted	1
and	1
very	1
good	1
humored	1
If	1
Levin	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
married	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
rather	1
disliked	1
his	1
holiday	1
attitude	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
assumption	1
of	1
elegance	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
high	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
disputed	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
nails	1
and	1
a	1
stylish	1
cap	1
and	1
everything	1
else	1
to	1
correspond	1
but	1
this	1
could	1
be	1
forgiven	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
nature	1
and	1
good	1
breeding	1
Levin	1
liked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
education	1
for	1
speaking	1
French	1
and	1
English	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
excellent	1
accent	1
and	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
world	1
Vassenka	1
was	1
extremely	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
left	1
horse	1
a	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
Don	1
Steppes	1
He	1
kept	1
praising	1
him	1
enthusiastically	1
How	1
fine	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
galloping	1
over	1
the	1
steppes	1
on	1
a	1
steppe	1
horse	1
Eh	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
He	1
had	1
imagined	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
steppe	1
horse	1
as	1
something	1
wild	1
and	1
romantic	1
and	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
But	1
his	1
simplicity	1
particularly	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
good	1
looks	1
his	1
amiable	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
his	1
movements	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
Either	1
because	1
his	1
nature	1
was	1
sympathetic	1
to	1
Levin	1
or	1
because	1
Levin	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
his	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
by	1
seeing	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
him	1
anyway	1
he	1
liked	1
his	1
society	1
After	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
over	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
home	1
Veslovsky	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
felt	1
for	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
his	1
pocketbook	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
them	1
or	1
left	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
In	1
the	1
pocketbook	1
there	1
were	1
thirty	1
seven	1
pounds	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
matter	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
Levin	1
I	1
ll	1
gallop	1
home	1
on	1
that	1
left	1
trace	1
horse	1
That	1
will	1
be	1
splendid	1
Eh	1
he	1
said	1
preparing	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
No	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
answered	1
Levin	1
calculating	1
that	1
Vassenka	1
could	1
hardly	1
weigh	1
less	1
than	1
seventeen	1
stone	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
the	1
coachman	1
The	1
coachman	1
rode	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
trace	1
horse	1
and	1
Levin	1
himself	1
drove	1
the	1
remaining	1
pair	1

Well	1
now	1
what	1
s	1
our	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign	1
Tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Our	1
plan	1
is	1
this	1
Now	1
we	1
re	1
driving	1
to	1
Gvozdyov	1
In	1
Gvozdyov	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
grouse	1
marsh	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
and	1
beyond	1
Gvozdyov	1
come	1
some	1
magnificent	1
snipe	1
marshes	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
grouse	1
too	1
It	1
s	1
hot	1
now	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
get	1
there	1
it	1
s	1
fifteen	1
miles	1
or	1
so	1
towards	1
evening	1
and	1
have	1
some	1
evening	1
shooting	1
we	1
ll	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
there	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
tomorrow	1
to	1
the	1
bigger	1
moors	1
And	1
is	1
there	1
nothing	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
Yes	1
but	1
we	1
ll	1
reserve	1
ourselves	1
besides	1
it	1
s	1
hot	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
nice	1
little	1
places	1
but	1
I	1
doubt	1
there	1
being	1
anything	1
to	1
shoot	1
Levin	1
would	1
himself	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
these	1
little	1
places	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
near	1
home	1
he	1
could	1
shoot	1
them	1
over	1
any	1
time	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
little	1
places	1
there	1
would	1
hardly	1
be	1
room	1
for	1
three	1
to	1
shoot	1
And	1
so	1
with	1
some	1
insincerity	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
doubted	1
there	1
being	1
anything	1
to	1
shoot	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
little	1
marsh	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
driven	1
by	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
the	1
experienced	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
sportsman	1
at	1
once	1
detected	1
reeds	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
Shan	1
t	1
we	1
try	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
marsh	1
Levin	1
do	1
please	1
how	1
delightful	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
began	1
begging	1
and	1
Levin	1
could	1
but	1
consent	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
dogs	1
had	1
flown	1
one	1
before	1
the	1
other	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
Krak	1
Laska	1
The	1
dogs	1
came	1
back	1
There	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
room	1
for	1
three	1
I	1
ll	1
stay	1
here	1
said	1
Levin	1
hoping	1
they	1
would	1
find	1
nothing	1
but	1
peewits	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
dogs	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
in	1
their	1
flight	1
were	1
plaintively	1
wailing	1
over	1
the	1
marsh	1
No	1
Come	1
along	1
Levin	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
together	1
Veslovsky	1
called	1
Really	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
room	1
Laska	1
back	1
Laska	1
You	1
won	1
t	1
want	1
another	1
dog	1
will	1
you	1
Levin	1
remained	1
with	1
the	1
wagonette	1
and	1
looked	1
enviously	1
at	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
They	1
walked	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
marsh	1
Except	1
little	1
birds	1
and	1
peewits	1
of	1
which	1
Vassenka	1
killed	1
one	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
marsh	1
Come	1
you	1
see	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
grudged	1
the	1
marsh	1
said	1
Levin	1
only	1
it	1
s	1
wasting	1
time	1
Oh	1
no	1
it	1
was	1
jolly	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
us	1
said	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
clambering	1
awkwardly	1
into	1
the	1
wagonette	1
with	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
peewit	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
How	1
splendidly	1
I	1
shot	1
this	1
bird	1
Didn	1
t	1
I	1
Well	1
shall	1
we	1
soon	1
be	1
getting	1
to	1
the	1
real	1
place	1
The	1
horses	1
started	1
off	1
suddenly	1
Levin	1
knocked	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
someone	1
s	1
gun	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
shot	1
The	1
gun	1
did	1
actually	1
go	1
off	1
first	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
had	1
pulled	1
only	1
one	1
trigger	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
other	1
hammer	1
still	1
cocked	1
The	1
charge	1
flew	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
without	1
doing	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
laughed	1
reprovingly	1
at	1
Veslovsky	1
But	1
Levin	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
reprove	1
him	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
any	1
reproach	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
danger	1
he	1
had	1
incurred	1
and	1
the	1
bump	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
Levin	1
s	1
forehead	1
And	1
besides	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
so	1
na"ively	1
distressed	1
and	1
then	1
laughed	1
so	1
good	1
humoredly	1
and	1
infectiously	1
at	1
their	1
general	1
dismay	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
laugh	1
with	1
him	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
second	1
marsh	1
which	1
was	1
fairly	1
large	1
and	1
would	1
inevitably	1
take	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
shoot	1
over	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
them	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
by	1
But	1
Veslovsky	1
again	1
overpersuaded	1
him	1
Again	1
as	1
the	1
marsh	1
was	1
narrow	1
Levin	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
host	1
remained	1
with	1
the	1
carriage	1
Krak	1
made	1
straight	1
for	1
some	1
clumps	1
of	1
sedge	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
run	1
after	1
the	1
dog	1
Before	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
a	1
grouse	1
flew	1
out	1
Veslovsky	1
missed	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
flew	1
into	1
an	1
unmown	1
meadow	1
This	1
grouse	1
was	1
left	1
for	1
Veslovsky	1
to	1
follow	1
up	1
Krak	1
found	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
pointed	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
shot	1
it	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
Now	1
you	1
go	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
stay	1
with	1
the	1
horses	1
he	1
said	1
Levin	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
a	1
sportsman	1
s	1
envy	1
He	1
handed	1
the	1
reins	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
Laska	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
plaintively	1
whining	1
and	1
fretting	1
against	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
her	1
treatment	1
flew	1
straight	1
ahead	1
to	1
a	1
hopeful	1
place	1
that	1
Levin	1
knew	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
Krak	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
upon	1
Why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
stop	1
her	1
shouted	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
She	1
won	1
t	1
scare	1
them	1
answered	1
Levin	1
sympathizing	1
with	1
his	1
bitch	1
s	1
pleasure	1
and	1
hurrying	1
after	1
her	1
As	1
she	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
familiar	1
breeding	1
places	1
there	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
earnestness	1
in	1
Laska	1
s	1
exploration	1
A	1
little	1
marsh	1
bird	1
did	1
not	1
divert	1
her	1
attention	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
instant	1
She	1
made	1
one	1
circuit	1
round	1
the	1
clump	1
of	1
reeds	1
was	1
beginning	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
suddenly	1
quivered	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
became	1
motionless	1
Come	1
come	1
Stiva	1
shouted	1
Levin	1
feeling	1
his	1
heart	1
beginning	1
to	1
beat	1
more	1
violently	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
shutter	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
back	1
from	1
his	1
straining	1
ears	1
all	1
sounds	1
confused	1
but	1
loud	1
began	1
to	1
beat	1
on	1
his	1
hearing	1
losing	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
distance	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
mistaking	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
brittle	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
twigs	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
trodden	1
taking	1
this	1
sound	1
for	1
the	1
flying	1
of	1
a	1
grouse	1
He	1
heard	1
too	1
not	1
far	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
splashing	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
explain	1
to	1
himself	1
Picking	1
his	1
steps	1
he	1
moved	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1
Fetch	1
it	1
Not	1
a	1
grouse	1
but	1
a	1
snipe	1
flew	1
up	1
from	1
beside	1
the	1
dog	1
Levin	1
had	1
lifted	1
his	1
gun	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
aim	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
splashing	1
grew	1
louder	1
came	1
closer	1
and	1
was	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Veslovsky	1
s	1
voice	1
shouting	1
something	1
with	1
strange	1
loudness	1
Levin	1
saw	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
gun	1
pointed	1
behind	1
the	1
snipe	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
fired	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
missed	1
Levin	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
wagonette	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
marsh	1
Veslovsky	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
shooting	1
had	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
got	1
the	1
horses	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
Damn	1
the	1
fellow	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
had	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
mire	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
drive	1
in	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
dryly	1
and	1
calling	1
the	1
coachman	1
he	1
began	1
pulling	1
the	1
horses	1
out	1
Levin	1
was	1
vexed	1
both	1
at	1
being	1
hindered	1
from	1
shooting	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
horses	1
getting	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
neither	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
nor	1
Veslovsky	1
helped	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
unharness	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
get	1
them	1
out	1
since	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
the	1
slightest	1
notion	1
of	1
harnessing	1
Without	1
vouchsafing	1
a	1
syllable	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
Vassenka	1
s	1
protestations	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
dry	1
there	1
Levin	1
worked	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
the	1
coachman	1
at	1
extricating	1
the	1
horses	1
But	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
warm	1
at	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
assiduously	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
tugging	1
at	1
the	1
wagonette	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
guards	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
broke	1
it	1
indeed	1
Levin	1
blamed	1
himself	1
for	1
having	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
yesterday	1
s	1
feelings	1
been	1
too	1
cold	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
genial	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
his	1
chilliness	1
When	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
right	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
Levin	1
had	1
the	1
lunch	1
served	1
Bon	1

Vassenka	1
who	1
had	1
recovered	1
his	1
spirits	1
quoted	1
the	1
French	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
finished	1
his	1
second	1
chicken	1
Well	1
now	1
our	1
troubles	1
are	1
over	1
now	1
everything	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
go	1
well	1
Only	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
my	1
sins	1
I	1
m	1
bound	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
That	1
s	1
so	1

No	1

You	1

how	1
I	1

get	1
you	1
along	1
he	1
answered	1
not	1
letting	1
go	1
the	1
rein	1
when	1
Levin	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
coachman	1
drive	1
No	1
I	1
must	1
atone	1
for	1
my	1
sins	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
comfortable	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
And	1
he	1
drove	1
Levin	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
afraid	1
he	1
would	1
exhaust	1
the	1
horses	1
especially	1
the	1
chestnut	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
hold	1
in	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
fell	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
gaiety	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
songs	1
he	1
sang	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
or	1
the	1
descriptions	1
and	1
representations	1
he	1
gave	1
of	1
driving	1
in	1
the	1
English	1
fashion	1
four	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
of	1
spirits	1
that	1
after	1
lunch	1
they	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Gvozdyov	1
marsh	1
Chapter	1
10	1
Vassenka	1
drove	1
the	1
horses	1
so	1
smartly	1
that	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
marsh	1
too	1
early	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
hot	1
As	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
this	1
more	1
important	1
marsh	1
the	1
chief	1
aim	1
of	1
their	1
expedition	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
considering	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
Vassenka	1
and	1
be	1
free	1
in	1
his	1
movements	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
evidently	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
desire	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
Levin	1
saw	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
always	1
present	1
in	1
a	1
true	1
sportsman	1
when	1
beginning	1
shooting	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
good	1
humored	1
slyness	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
splendid	1
marsh	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
hawks	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
pointing	1
to	1
two	1
great	1
birds	1
hovering	1
over	1
the	1
reeds	1
Where	1
there	1
are	1
hawks	1
there	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
game	1
Now	1
gentlemen	1
said	1
Levin	1
pulling	1
up	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
examining	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
his	1
gun	1
with	1
rather	1
a	1
gloomy	1
expression	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
those	1
reeds	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
an	1
oasis	1
of	1
blackish	1
green	1
in	1
the	1
huge	1
half	1
mown	1
wet	1
meadow	1
that	1
stretched	1
along	1
the	1
right	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
The	1
marsh	1
begins	1
here	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
greener	1
From	1
here	1
it	1
runs	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
where	1
the	1
horses	1
are	1
there	1
are	1
breeding	1
places	1
there	1
and	1
grouse	1
and	1
all	1
round	1
those	1
reeds	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
that	1
alder	1
and	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mill	1
Over	1
there	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
pools	1
are	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
There	1
I	1
once	1
shot	1
seventeen	1
snipe	1
We	1
ll	1
separate	1
with	1
the	1
dogs	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
and	1
then	1
meet	1
over	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
mill	1
Well	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
which	1
to	1
right	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
It	1
s	1
wider	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
you	1
two	1
go	1
that	1
way	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
take	1
the	1
left	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
apparent	1
carelessness	1
Capital	1
we	1
ll	1
make	1
the	1
bigger	1
bag	1
Yes	1
come	1
along	1
come	1
along	1
Vassenka	1
exclaimed	1
Levin	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
agree	1
and	1
they	1
divided	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
marsh	1
the	1
two	1
dogs	1
began	1
hunting	1
about	1
together	1
and	1
made	1
towards	1
the	1
green	1
slime	1
covered	1
pool	1
Levin	1
knew	1
Laska	1
s	1
method	1
wary	1
and	1
indefinite	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
place	1
too	1
and	1
expected	1
a	1
whole	1
covey	1
of	1
snipe	1
Veslovsky	1
beside	1
me	1
walk	1
beside	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
faint	1
voice	1
to	1
his	1
companion	1
splashing	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
behind	1
him	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
his	1
gun	1
was	1
pointed	1
after	1
that	1
casual	1
shot	1
near	1
the	1
Kolpensky	1
marsh	1
Oh	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
get	1
in	1
your	1
way	1
don	1
t	1
trouble	1
about	1
me	1
But	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
troubling	1
and	1
recalled	1
Kitty	1
s	1
words	1
at	1
parting	1
Mind	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
shoot	1
one	1
another	1
The	1
dogs	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
passed	1
each	1
other	1
each	1
pursuing	1
its	1
own	1
scent	1
The	1
expectation	1
of	1
snipe	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
that	1
to	1
Levin	1
the	1
squelching	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heel	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
it	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mire	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
a	1
snipe	1
and	1
he	1
clutched	1
and	1
pressed	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
his	1
gun	1
Bang	1
bang	1
sounded	1
almost	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
Vassenka	1
had	1
fired	1
at	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
ducks	1
which	1
was	1
hovering	1
over	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
flying	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
towards	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
Before	1
Levin	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
whir	1
of	1
one	1
snipe	1
another	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
some	1
eight	1
more	1
rose	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
hit	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
beginning	1
its	1
zigzag	1
movements	1
and	1
the	1
snipe	1
fell	1
in	1
a	1
heap	1
into	1
the	1
mud	1
Oblonsky	1
aimed	1
deliberately	1
at	1
another	1
still	1
flying	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
reeds	1
and	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
that	1
snipe	1
too	1
fell	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
fluttering	1
out	1
where	1
the	1
sedge	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
its	1
unhurt	1
wing	1
showing	1
white	1
beneath	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
lucky	1
he	1
aimed	1
at	1
his	1
first	1
bird	1
too	1
low	1
and	1
missed	1
he	1
aimed	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
rising	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
another	1
snipe	1
flew	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
feet	1
distracting	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
missed	1
again	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
loading	1
their	1
guns	1
another	1
snipe	1
rose	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
load	1
again	1
sent	1
two	1
charges	1
of	1
small	1
shot	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
snipe	1
and	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
Levin	1
Well	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
separate	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
limping	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
holding	1
his	1
gun	1
in	1
readiness	1
and	1
whistling	1
to	1
his	1
dog	1
he	1
walked	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
Levin	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
It	1
always	1
happened	1
with	1
Levin	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
first	1
shots	1
were	1
a	1
failure	1
he	1
got	1
hot	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
shot	1
badly	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
day	1
The	1
snipe	1
showed	1
themselves	1
in	1
numbers	1
They	1
kept	1
flying	1
up	1
from	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
dogs	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
s	1
legs	1
and	1
Levin	1
might	1
have	1
retrieved	1
his	1
ill	1
luck	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
shot	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
disgraced	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Veslovsky	1
who	1
kept	1
popping	1
away	1
merrily	1
and	1
indiscriminately	1
killing	1
nothing	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
abashed	1
by	1
his	1
ill	1
success	1
Levin	1
in	1
feverish	1
haste	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
himself	1
got	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
ended	1
by	1
shooting	1
almost	1
without	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
hitting	1
Laska	1
indeed	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
this	1
She	1
began	1
looking	1
more	1
languidly	1
and	1
gazed	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
perplexity	1
or	1
reproach	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
Shots	1
followed	1
shots	1
in	1
rapid	1
succession	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
powder	1
hung	1
about	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
roomy	1
net	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
bag	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
three	1
light	1
little	1
snipe	1
And	1
of	1
these	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
by	1
Veslovsky	1
alone	1
and	1
one	1
by	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together	1
Meanwhile	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
shots	1
not	1
frequent	1
but	1
as	1
Levin	1
fancied	1
well	1
directed	1
for	1
almost	1
after	1
each	1
they	1
heard	1
Krak	1
Krak	1
apporte	1
This	1
excited	1
Levin	1
still	1
more	1
The	1
snipe	1
were	1
floating	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
over	1
the	1
reeds	1
Their	1
whirring	1
wings	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
their	1
harsh	1
cries	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
the	1
snipe	1
that	1
had	1
risen	1
first	1
and	1
flown	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
settled	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
Instead	1
of	1
two	1
hawks	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
dozens	1
of	1
them	1
hovering	1
with	1
shrill	1
cries	1
over	1
the	1
marsh	1
After	1
walking	1
through	1
the	1
larger	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
Levin	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
peasants	1
mowing	1
grass	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
long	1
strips	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
reeds	1
marked	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
by	1
the	1
trampled	1
grass	1
in	1
another	1
by	1
a	1
path	1
mown	1
through	1
it	1
Half	1
of	1
these	1
strips	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
mown	1
Though	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
birds	1
in	1
the	1
uncut	1
part	1
as	1
the	1
cut	1
part	1
Levin	1
had	1
promised	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
companion	1
through	1
the	1
cut	1
and	1
uncut	1
patches	1
Hi	1
sportsmen	1
shouted	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
peasants	1
sitting	1
on	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
cart	1
come	1
and	1
have	1
some	1
lunch	1
with	1
us	1
Have	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
wine	1
Levin	1
looked	1
round	1
Come	1
along	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
shouted	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
looking	1
bearded	1
peasant	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face	1
showing	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
grin	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
greenish	1
bottle	1
that	1
flashed	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
Qu	1

asked	1
Veslovsky	1
They	1
invite	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
vodka	1
Most	1
likely	1
they	1
ve	1
been	1
dividing	1
the	1
meadow	1
into	1
lots	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
some	1
said	1
Levin	1
not	1
without	1
some	1
guile	1
hoping	1
Veslovsky	1
would	1
be	1
tempted	1
by	1
the	1
vodka	1
and	1
would	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
them	1
Why	1
do	1
they	1
offer	1
it	1
Oh	1
they	1
re	1
merry	1
making	1
Really	1
you	1
should	1
join	1
them	1
You	1
would	1
be	1
interested	1

You	1
go	1
you	1
go	1
you	1
ll	1
find	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
mill	1
cried	1
Levin	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
he	1
perceived	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
Veslovsky	1
bent	1
and	1
stumbling	1
with	1
weariness	1
holding	1
his	1
gun	1
out	1
at	1
arm	1
s	1
length	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
towards	1
the	1
peasants	1
You	1
come	1
too	1
the	1
peasants	1
shouted	1
to	1
Levin	1
Never	1
fear	1
You	1
taste	1
our	1
cake	1
Levin	1
felt	1
a	1
strong	1
inclination	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
little	1
vodka	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
some	1
bread	1
He	1
was	1
exhausted	1
and	1
felt	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
to	1
drag	1
his	1
staggering	1
legs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mire	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
he	1
hesitated	1
But	1
Laska	1
was	1
setting	1
And	1
immediately	1
all	1
his	1
weariness	1
vanished	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
lightly	1
through	1
the	1
swamp	1
towards	1
the	1
dog	1
A	1
snipe	1
flew	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
he	1
fired	1
and	1
killed	1
it	1
Laska	1
still	1
pointed	1
Fetch	1
it	1
Another	1
bird	1
flew	1
up	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1
Levin	1
fired	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
unlucky	1
day	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
missed	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
that	1
either	1
He	1
wandered	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
reeds	1
but	1
Laska	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
sent	1
her	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
she	1
pretended	1
to	1
hunt	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Vassenka	1
on	1
whom	1
Levin	1
threw	1
the	1
blame	1
of	1
his	1
failure	1
things	1
went	1
no	1
better	1
There	1
were	1
plenty	1
of	1
snipe	1
still	1
but	1
Levin	1
made	1
one	1
miss	1
after	1
another	1
The	1
slanting	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
still	1
hot	1
his	1
clothes	1
soaked	1
through	1
with	1
perspiration	1
stuck	1
to	1
his	1
body	1
his	1
left	1
boot	1
full	1
of	1
water	1
weighed	1
heavily	1
on	1
his	1
leg	1
and	1
squeaked	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
the	1
sweat	1
ran	1
in	1
drops	1
down	1
his	1
powder	1
grimed	1
face	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
bitter	1
taste	1
his	1
nose	1
of	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
powder	1
and	1
stagnant	1
water	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
ringing	1
with	1
the	1
incessant	1
whir	1
of	1
the	1
snipe	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
touch	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
his	1
gun	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
hot	1
his	1
heart	1
beat	1
with	1
short	1
rapid	1
throbs	1
his	1
hands	1
shook	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
his	1
weary	1
legs	1
stumbled	1
and	1
staggered	1
over	1
the	1
hillocks	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
swamp	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
and	1
still	1
he	1
shot	1
At	1
last	1
after	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
miss	1
he	1
flung	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
No	1
I	1
must	1
control	1
myself	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
Picking	1
up	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
his	1
hat	1
he	1
called	1
Laska	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
swamp	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
ground	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
boot	1
and	1
emptied	1
it	1
then	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
marsh	1
drank	1
some	1
stagnant	1
tasting	1
water	1
moistened	1
his	1
burning	1
hot	1
gun	1
and	1
washed	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
hands	1
Feeling	1
refreshed	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
a	1
snipe	1
had	1
settled	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
to	1
keep	1
cool	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
again	1
His	1
finger	1
pressed	1
the	1
cock	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
good	1
aim	1
at	1
the	1
bird	1
It	1
got	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
He	1
had	1
only	1
five	1
birds	1
in	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
when	1
he	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
towards	1
the	1
alders	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
rejoin	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Before	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
dog	1
Krak	1
darted	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
twisted	1
root	1
of	1
an	1
alder	1
black	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
stinking	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
conqueror	1
sniffed	1
at	1
Laska	1
Behind	1
Krak	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
alder	1
tree	1
the	1
shapely	1
figure	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
red	1
and	1
perspiring	1
with	1
unbuttoned	1
neckband	1
still	1
limping	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Well	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
popping	1
away	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
good	1
humoredly	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
on	1
queried	1
Levin	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
the	1
full	1
game	1
bag	1
Oh	1
pretty	1
fair	1
He	1
had	1
fourteen	1
birds	1
A	1
splendid	1
marsh	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
doubt	1
Veslovsky	1
got	1
in	1
your	1
way	1
It	1
s	1
awkward	1
too	1
shooting	1
with	1
one	1
dog	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
soften	1
his	1
triumph	1
Chapter	1
11	1
When	1
Levin	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
reached	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
hut	1
where	1
Levin	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
stay	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
already	1
there	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
clinging	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
bench	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
pulled	1
by	1
a	1
soldier	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
helping	1
him	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
miry	1
boots	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
laughing	1
his	1
infectious	1
good	1
humored	1
laugh	1
I	1
ve	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
Ils	1
ont	1

charmants	1
Just	1
fancy	1
they	1
gave	1
me	1
drink	1
fed	1
me	1
Such	1
bread	1
it	1
was	1
exquisite	1
D'elicieux	1
	1
And	1
the	1
vodka	1
I	1
never	1
tasted	1
any	1
better	1
And	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
penny	1
for	1
anything	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
saying	1
Excuse	1
our	1
homely	1
ways	1
What	1
should	1
they	1
take	1
anything	1
for	1
They	1
were	1
entertaining	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
they	1
keep	1
vodka	1
for	1
sale	1
said	1
the	1
soldier	1
succeeding	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
pulling	1
the	1
soaked	1
boot	1
off	1
the	1
blackened	1
stocking	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
dirtiness	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
muddied	1
by	1
their	1
boots	1
and	1
the	1
filthy	1
dogs	1
licking	1
themselves	1
clean	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
marsh	1
mud	1
and	1
powder	1
that	1
filled	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
forks	1
the	1
party	1
drank	1
their	1
tea	1
and	1
ate	1
their	1
supper	1
with	1
a	1
relish	1
only	1
known	1
to	1
sportsmen	1
Washed	1
and	1
clean	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
hay	1
barn	1
swept	1
ready	1
for	1
them	1
where	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
up	1
beds	1
for	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
dusk	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
After	1
wavering	1
among	1
reminiscences	1
and	1
anecdotes	1
of	1
guns	1
of	1
dogs	1
and	1
of	1
former	1
shooting	1
parties	1
the	1
conversation	1
rested	1
on	1
a	1
topic	1
that	1
interested	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
After	1
Vassenka	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
over	1
expressed	1
his	1
appreciation	1
of	1
this	1
delightful	1
sleeping	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
fragrant	1
hay	1
this	1
delightful	1
broken	1
cart	1
he	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
because	1
the	1
shafts	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
that	1
had	1
treated	1
him	1
to	1
vodka	1
of	1
the	1
dogs	1
who	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
masters	1
Oblonsky	1
began	1
telling	1
them	1
of	1
a	1
delightful	1
shooting	1
party	1
at	1
Malthus	1
s	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
stayed	1
the	1
previous	1
summer	1
Malthus	1
was	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
capitalist	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
money	1
by	1
speculation	1
in	1
railway	1
shares	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
described	1
what	1
grouse	1
moors	1
this	1
Malthus	1
had	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
Tver	1
province	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
preserved	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
and	1
dogcarts	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
shooting	1
party	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
and	1
the	1
luncheon	1
pavilion	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
rigged	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
marsh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
hay	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
such	1
people	1
don	1
t	1
disgust	1
you	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
a	1
lunch	1
with	1
Lafitte	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
pleasant	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
dislike	1
just	1
that	1
very	1
sumptuousness	1
All	1
these	1
people	1
just	1
like	1
our	1
spirit	1
monopolists	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
get	1
their	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
gains	1
them	1
the	1
contempt	1
of	1
everyone	1
They	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
their	1
contempt	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
use	1
their	1
dishonest	1
gains	1
to	1
buy	1
off	1
the	1
contempt	1
they	1
have	1
deserved	1
Perfectly	1
true	1
chimed	1
in	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
Perfectly	1
Oblonsky	1
of	1
course	1
goes	1
out	1
of	1
bonhomie	1
but	1
other	1
people	1
say	1
Well	1
Oblonsky	1
stays	1
with	1
them	1
Not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it	1
Levin	1
could	1
hear	1
that	1
Oblonsky	1
was	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
I	1
simply	1
don	1
t	1
consider	1
him	1
more	1
dishonest	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
wealthy	1
merchant	1
or	1
nobleman	1
They	1
ve	1
all	1
made	1
their	1
money	1
alike	1
by	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
their	1
intelligence	1
Oh	1
by	1
what	1
work	1
Do	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
work	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
concessions	1
and	1
speculate	1
with	1
them	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
s	1
work	1
Work	1
in	1
this	1
sense	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
him	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
railways	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
work	1
like	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
peasant	1
or	1
a	1
learned	1
profession	1
Granted	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
his	1
activity	1
produces	1
a	1
result	1
the	1
railways	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
railways	1
useless	1
No	1
that	1
s	1
another	1
question	1
I	1
am	1
prepared	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
they	1
re	1
useful	1
But	1
all	1
profit	1
that	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
labor	1
expended	1
is	1
dishonest	1
But	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
define	1
what	1
is	1
proportionate	1
Making	1
profit	1
by	1
dishonest	1
means	1
by	1
trickery	1
said	1
Levin	1
conscious	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
a	1
distinct	1
line	1
between	1
honesty	1
and	1
dishonesty	1
Such	1
as	1
banking	1
for	1
instance	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
It	1
s	1
an	1
evil	1
the	1
amassing	1
of	1
huge	1
fortunes	1
without	1
labor	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
monopolies	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
the	1
form	1
that	1
s	1
changed	1
Le	1

No	1
sooner	1
were	1
the	1
spirit	1
monopolies	1
abolished	1
than	1
the	1
railways	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
banking	1
companies	1
that	1
too	1
is	1
profit	1
without	1
work	1
Yes	1
that	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
very	1
true	1
and	1
clever	1
Lie	1
down	1
Krak	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
dog	1
who	1
was	1
scratching	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
hay	1
He	1
was	1
obviously	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
and	1
so	1
talked	1
serenely	1
and	1
without	1
haste	1
But	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
drawn	1
the	1
line	1
between	1
honest	1
and	1
dishonest	1
work	1
That	1
I	1
receive	1
a	1
bigger	1
salary	1
than	1
my	1
chief	1
clerk	1
though	1
he	1
knows	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
work	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
s	1
dishonest	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
Well	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
your	1
receiving	1
some	1
five	1
thousand	1
let	1
s	1
say	1
for	1
your	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
while	1
our	1
host	1
the	1
peasant	1
here	1
however	1
hard	1
he	1
works	1
can	1
never	1
get	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
roubles	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
dishonest	1
as	1
my	1
earning	1
more	1
than	1
my	1
chief	1
clerk	1
and	1
Malthus	1
getting	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
station	1
master	1
No	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
society	1
takes	1
up	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
antagonistic	1
attitude	1
to	1
these	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
utterly	1
baseless	1
and	1
I	1
fancy	1
there	1
s	1
envy	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it	1
No	1
that	1
s	1
unfair	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
how	1
could	1
envy	1
come	1
in	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
not	1
nice	1
about	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
business	1
You	1
say	1
Levin	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
unjust	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
receive	1
five	1
thousand	1
while	1
the	1
peasant	1
has	1
fifty	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
It	1
is	1
unfair	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
but	1
It	1
really	1
is	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
we	1
spend	1
our	1
time	1
riding	1
drinking	1
shooting	1
doing	1
nothing	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
forever	1
at	1
work	1
said	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
obviously	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
reflecting	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
consequently	1
considering	1
it	1
with	1
perfect	1
sincerity	1
Yes	1
you	1
feel	1
it	1
but	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
give	1
him	1
your	1
property	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
intentionally	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
provoking	1
Levin	1
There	1
had	1
arisen	1
of	1
late	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
secret	1
antagonism	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
brothers	1
in	1
law	1
as	1
though	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
married	1
sisters	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
rivalry	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
between	1
them	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
was	1
ordering	1
his	1
life	1
best	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
hostility	1
showed	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
as	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
personal	1
note	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
give	1
it	1
away	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
demands	1
that	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
away	1
answered	1
Levin	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
Give	1
it	1
to	1
this	1
peasant	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
it	1
Yes	1
but	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
Am	1
I	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
deed	1
of	1
conveyance	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
convinced	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
convinced	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
duties	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
family	1
No	1
excuse	1
me	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
consider	1
this	1
inequality	1
is	1
unjust	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
act	1
accordingly	1
Well	1
I	1
do	1
act	1
negatively	1
on	1
that	1
idea	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
not	1
trying	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
position	1
existing	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
me	1
No	1
excuse	1
me	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
paradox	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
sophistry	1
about	1
that	1
Veslovsky	1
agreed	1
Ah	1
our	1
host	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
asleep	1
yet	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
barn	1
opening	1
the	1
creaking	1
door	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
asleep	1
No	1
how	1
s	1
one	1
to	1
sleep	1
I	1
thought	1
our	1
gentlemen	1
would	1
be	1
asleep	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
chattering	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
hook	1
from	1
here	1
She	1
won	1
t	1
bite	1
he	1
added	1
stepping	1
cautiously	1
with	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
And	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
We	1
are	1
going	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
Ah	1
what	1
a	1
night	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
looking	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
and	1
the	1
unharnessed	1
wagonette	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
faint	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
glow	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
doors	1
But	1
listen	1
there	1
are	1
women	1
s	1
voices	1
singing	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
not	1
badly	1
too	1
Who	1
s	1
that	1
singing	1
my	1
friend	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
maids	1
from	1
hard	1
by	1
here	1
Let	1
s	1
go	1
let	1
s	1
have	1
a	1
walk	1
We	1
shan	1
t	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
you	1
know	1
Oblonsky	1
come	1
along	1
If	1
one	1
could	1
only	1
do	1
both	1
lie	1
here	1
and	1
go	1
answered	1
Oblonsky	1
stretching	1
It	1
s	1
capital	1
lying	1
here	1
Well	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
by	1
myself	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
getting	1
up	1
eagerly	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings	1
Good	1
bye	1
gentlemen	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
fun	1
I	1
ll	1
fetch	1
you	1
You	1
ve	1
treated	1
me	1
to	1
some	1
good	1
sport	1
and	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
forget	1
you	1
He	1
really	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow	1
isn	1
t	1
he	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
when	1
Veslovsky	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
peasant	1
had	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him	1
Yes	1
capital	1
answered	1
Levin	1
still	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
just	1
before	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
clearly	1
expressed	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
feelings	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
capacity	1
and	1
yet	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
straightforward	1
men	1
and	1
not	1
fools	1
had	1
said	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
comforting	1
himself	1
with	1
sophistries	1
This	1
disconcerted	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
this	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
One	1
must	1
do	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
things	1
either	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
existing	1
order	1
of	1
society	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
then	1
stick	1
up	1
for	1
one	1
s	1
rights	1
in	1
it	1
or	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
enjoying	1
unjust	1
privileges	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
and	1
then	1
enjoy	1
them	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
No	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
unjust	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
enjoy	1
these	1
advantages	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
why	1
not	1
go	1
after	1
all	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
evidently	1
weary	1
of	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
thought	1
We	1
shan	1
t	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
you	1
know	1
Come	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
What	1
they	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
he	1
acted	1
justly	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
negative	1
sense	1
absorbed	1
his	1
thoughts	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
possible	1
to	1
be	1
just	1
negatively	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
himself	1
How	1
strong	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
fresh	1
hay	1
is	1
though	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
getting	1
up	1
There	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
sleeping	1
Vassenka	1
has	1
been	1
getting	1
up	1
some	1
fun	1
there	1
Do	1
you	1
hear	1
the	1
laughing	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
Hadn	1
t	1
we	1
better	1
go	1
Come	1
along	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
coming	1
answered	1
Levin	1
Surely	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
principle	1
too	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
for	1
his	1
cap	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
principle	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
go	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
preparing	1
trouble	1
for	1
yourself	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
finding	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
How	1
so	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
the	1
line	1
you	1
ve	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
your	1
wife	1
I	1
heard	1
how	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
consequence	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
you	1
re	1
to	1
be	1
away	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
shooting	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
as	1
an	1
idyllic	1
episode	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
that	1
won	1
t	1
answer	1
A	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
independent	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
masculine	1
interests	1
A	1
man	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
manly	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
In	1
what	1
way	1
To	1
go	1
running	1
after	1
servant	1
girls	1
said	1
Levin	1
Why	1
not	1
if	1
it	1
amuses	1
him	1
Ca	1
ne	1
tire	1
pas	1
`a	1
cons'equence	1
It	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
my	1
wife	1
any	1
harm	1
and	1
it	1
ll	1
amuse	1
me	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
respect	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
the	1
home	1
There	1
should	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
home	1
But	1
don	1
t	1
tie	1
your	1
own	1
hands	1
Perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
Levin	1
dryly	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
Tomorrow	1
early	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
shooting	1
and	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
wake	1
anyone	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
daybreak	1
Messieurs	1
venez	1
vite	1
	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Veslovsky	1
coming	1
back	1
Charmante	1
	1
I	1
ve	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
discovery	1
Charmante	1
	1
a	1
perfect	1
Gretchen	1
and	1
I	1
ve	1
already	1
made	1
friends	1
with	1
her	1
Really	1
exceedingly	1
pretty	1
he	1
declared	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
approval	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
pretty	1
entirely	1
on	1
his	1
account	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
expressing	1
his	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
entertainment	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
provided	1
for	1
him	1
Levin	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
asleep	1
while	1
Oblonsky	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
slippers	1
and	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigar	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
and	1
soon	1
their	1
voices	1
were	1
lost	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
to	1
sleep	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
horses	1
munching	1
hay	1
then	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
peasant	1
and	1
his	1
elder	1
boy	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
going	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
watch	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
then	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
soldier	1
arranging	1
his	1
bed	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
with	1
his	1
nephew	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
of	1
their	1
peasant	1
host	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
boy	1
in	1
his	1
shrill	1
little	1
voice	1
telling	1
his	1
uncle	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
about	1
the	1
dogs	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
huge	1
and	1
terrible	1
creatures	1
and	1
asking	1
what	1
the	1
dogs	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
hunt	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
husky	1
sleepy	1
voice	1
telling	1
him	1
the	1
sportsmen	1
were	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
would	1
shoot	1
with	1
their	1
guns	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
boy	1
s	1
questions	1
he	1
said	1
Go	1
to	1
sleep	1
Vaska	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
or	1
you	1
ll	1
catch	1
it	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
began	1
snoring	1
himself	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
still	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
the	1
snort	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
guttural	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
snipe	1
Is	1
it	1
really	1
only	1
negative	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
Well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
thinking	1
about	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
Tomorrow	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
out	1
early	1
and	1
I	1
ll	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
keeping	1
cool	1
There	1
are	1
lots	1
of	1
snipe	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
grouse	1
too	1
When	1
I	1
come	1
back	1
there	1
ll	1
be	1
the	1
note	1
from	1
Kitty	1
Yes	1
Stiva	1
may	1
be	1
right	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
manly	1
with	1
her	1
I	1
m	1
tied	1
to	1
her	1
apron	1
strings	1
Well	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
Negative	1
again	1
Half	1
asleep	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
laughter	1
and	1
mirthful	1
talk	1
of	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
doorway	1
brightly	1
lighted	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
moonlight	1
they	1
were	1
standing	1
talking	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
one	1
girl	1
comparing	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
freshly	1
peeled	1
nut	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
with	1
his	1
infectious	1
laugh	1
was	1
repeating	1
some	1
words	1
probably	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
peasant	1
Ah	1
you	1
do	1
your	1
best	1
to	1
get	1
round	1
her	1
Levin	1
half	1
asleep	1
said	1
Gentlemen	1
tomorrow	1
before	1
daylight	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
Chapter	1

Waking	1
up	1
at	1
earliest	1
dawn	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
wake	1
his	1
companions	1
Vassenka	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
stomach	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
in	1
a	1
stocking	1
thrust	1
out	1
was	1
sleeping	1
so	1
soundly	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
elicit	1
no	1
response	1
Oblonsky	1
half	1
asleep	1
declined	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
so	1
early	1
Even	1
Laska	1
who	1
was	1
asleep	1
curled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
hay	1
got	1
up	1
unwillingly	1
and	1
lazily	1
stretched	1
out	1
and	1
straightened	1
her	1
hind	1
legs	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
Getting	1
on	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
stockings	1
taking	1
his	1
gun	1
and	1
carefully	1
opening	1
the	1
creaking	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
Levin	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
road	1
The	1
coachmen	1
were	1
sleeping	1
in	1
their	1
carriages	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
dozing	1
Only	1
one	1
was	1
lazily	1
eating	1
oats	1
dipping	1
its	1
nose	1
into	1
the	1
manger	1
It	1
was	1
still	1
gray	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
up	1
so	1
early	1
my	1
dear	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
their	1
hostess	1
said	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
and	1
addressing	1
him	1
affectionately	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
Going	1
shooting	1
granny	1
Do	1
I	1
go	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
marsh	1
Straight	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
by	1
our	1
threshing	1
floor	1
my	1
dear	1
and	1
hemp	1
patches	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
little	1
footpath	1
Stepping	1
carefully	1
with	1
her	1
sunburnt	1
bare	1
feet	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
conducted	1
Levin	1
and	1
moved	1
back	1
the	1
fence	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor	1
Straight	1
on	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
marsh	1
Our	1
lads	1
drove	1
the	1
cattle	1
there	1
yesterday	1
evening	1
Laska	1
ran	1
eagerly	1
forward	1
along	1
the	1
little	1
path	1
Levin	1
followed	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
rapid	1
step	1
continually	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
He	1
hoped	1
the	1
sun	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
up	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
marsh	1
But	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
not	1
delay	1
The	1
moon	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
bright	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
now	1
shone	1
only	1
like	1
a	1
crescent	1
of	1
quicksilver	1
The	1
pink	1
flush	1
of	1
dawn	1
which	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
before	1
now	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
sought	1
to	1
be	1
discerned	1
at	1
all	1
What	1
were	1
before	1
undefined	1
vague	1
blurs	1
in	1
the	1
distant	1
countryside	1
could	1
now	1
be	1
distinctly	1
seen	1
They	1
were	1
sheaves	1
of	1
rye	1
The	1
dew	1
not	1
visible	1
till	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up	1
wetted	1
Levin	1
s	1
legs	1
and	1
his	1
blouse	1
above	1
his	1
belt	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
growing	1
fragrant	1
hemp	1
patch	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
pollen	1
had	1
already	1
fallen	1
out	1
In	1
the	1
transparent	1
stillness	1
of	1
morning	1
the	1
smallest	1
sounds	1
were	1
audible	1
A	1
bee	1
flew	1
by	1
Levin	1
s	1
ear	1
with	1
the	1
whizzing	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
bullet	1
He	1
looked	1
carefully	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
beehives	1
behind	1
the	1
hedge	1
and	1
they	1
disappeared	1
over	1
the	1
hemp	1
patch	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
The	1
path	1
led	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
marsh	1
The	1
marsh	1
could	1
be	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
mist	1
which	1
rose	1
from	1
it	1
thicker	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
and	1
thinner	1
in	1
another	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
reeds	1
and	1
willow	1
bushes	1
swayed	1
like	1
islands	1
in	1
this	1
mist	1
At	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
and	1
the	1
road	1
peasant	1
boys	1
and	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
herding	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
were	1
lying	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
dawn	1
all	1
were	1
asleep	1
under	1
their	1
coats	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
them	1
were	1
three	1
hobbled	1
horses	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
clanked	1
a	1
chain	1
Laska	1
walked	1
beside	1
her	1
master	1
pressing	1
a	1
little	1
forward	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
Passing	1
the	1
sleeping	1
peasants	1
and	1
reaching	1
the	1
first	1
reeds	1
Levin	1
examined	1
his	1
pistols	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
dog	1
off	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
a	1
sleek	1
dark	1
brown	1
three	1
year	1
old	1
seeing	1
the	1
dog	1
started	1
away	1
switched	1
its	1
tail	1
and	1
snorted	1
The	1
other	1
horses	1
too	1
were	1
frightened	1
and	1
splashing	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
their	1
hobbled	1
legs	1
and	1
drawing	1
their	1
hoofs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thick	1
mud	1
with	1
a	1
squelching	1
sound	1
they	1
bounded	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
marsh	1
Laska	1
stopped	1
looking	1
ironically	1
at	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
patted	1
Laska	1
and	1
whistled	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
begin	1
Laska	1
ran	1
joyfully	1
and	1
anxiously	1
through	1
the	1
slush	1
that	1
swayed	1
under	1
her	1
Running	1
into	1
the	1
marsh	1
among	1
the	1
familiar	1
scents	1
of	1
roots	1
marsh	1
plants	1
and	1
slime	1
and	1
the	1
extraneous	1
smell	1
of	1
horse	1
dung	1
Laska	1
detected	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
smell	1
that	1
pervaded	1
the	1
whole	1
marsh	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
that	1
strong	1
smelling	1
bird	1
that	1
always	1
excited	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
among	1
the	1
moss	1
and	1
marsh	1
plants	1
this	1
scent	1
was	1
very	1
strong	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
determine	1
in	1
which	1
direction	1
it	1
grew	1
stronger	1
or	1
fainter	1
To	1
find	1
the	1
direction	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wind	1
Not	1
feeling	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
her	1
legs	1
Laska	1
bounded	1
with	1
a	1
stiff	1
gallop	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
each	1
bound	1
she	1
could	1
stop	1
short	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
blew	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
before	1
sunrise	1
and	1
turned	1
facing	1
the	1
wind	1
Sniffing	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
dilated	1
nostrils	1
she	1
felt	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
not	1
their	1
tracks	1
only	1
but	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
here	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
but	1
many	1
Laska	1
slackened	1
her	1
speed	1
They	1
were	1
here	1
but	1
where	1
precisely	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
determine	1
To	1
find	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
circle	1
when	1
suddenly	1
her	1
master	1
s	1
voice	1
drew	1
her	1
off	1
Laska	1
here	1
he	1
asked	1
pointing	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
direction	1
She	1
stopped	1
asking	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
doing	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
But	1
he	1
repeated	1
his	1
command	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
covered	1
with	1
water	1
where	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
anything	1
She	1
obeyed	1
him	1
pretending	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
went	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
position	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
scent	1
again	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
hindering	1
her	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
under	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
vexation	1
stumbling	1
over	1
a	1
high	1
stump	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
but	1
righting	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
strong	1
supple	1
legs	1
she	1
began	1
making	1
the	1
circle	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
clear	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
scent	1
of	1
them	1
reached	1
her	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
defined	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
became	1
perfectly	1
clear	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
here	1
behind	1
this	1
tuft	1
of	1
reeds	1
five	1
paces	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
stopped	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
rigid	1
On	1
her	1
short	1
legs	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
scent	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
sitting	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
paces	1
off	1
She	1
stood	1
still	1
feeling	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
enjoying	1
it	1
in	1
anticipation	1
Her	1
tail	1
was	1
stretched	1
straight	1
and	1
tense	1
and	1
only	1
wagging	1
at	1
the	1
extreme	1
end	1
Her	1
mouth	1
was	1
slightly	1
open	1
her	1
ears	1
raised	1
One	1
ear	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
wrong	1
side	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
she	1
breathed	1
heavily	1
but	1
warily	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
warily	1
looked	1
round	1
but	1
more	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
than	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
master	1
He	1
was	1
coming	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
face	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
though	1
the	1
eyes	1
were	1
always	1
terrible	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
stumbled	1
over	1
the	1
stump	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
moved	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
extraordinarily	1
slowly	1
She	1
thought	1
he	1
came	1
slowly	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
Noticing	1
Laska	1
s	1
special	1
attitude	1
as	1
she	1
crouched	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
scratching	1
big	1
prints	1
with	1
her	1
hind	1
paws	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
mouth	1
slightly	1
open	1
Levin	1
knew	1
she	1
was	1
pointing	1
at	1
grouse	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
inward	1
prayer	1
for	1
luck	1
especially	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
bird	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
Coming	1
quite	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
could	1
from	1
his	1
height	1
look	1
beyond	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
with	1
her	1
nose	1
In	1
a	1
space	1
between	1
two	1
little	1
thickets	1
at	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
yards	1
distance	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
grouse	1
Turning	1
its	1
head	1
it	1
was	1
listening	1
Then	1
lightly	1
preening	1
and	1
folding	1
its	1
wings	1
it	1
disappeared	1
round	1
a	1
corner	1
with	1
a	1
clumsy	1
wag	1
of	1
its	1
tail	1
Fetch	1
it	1
fetch	1
it	1
shouted	1
Levin	1
giving	1
Laska	1
a	1
shove	1
from	1
behind	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
thought	1
Laska	1
Where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
go	1
From	1
here	1
I	1
feel	1
them	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
move	1
forward	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
or	1
who	1
they	1
are	1
But	1
then	1
he	1
shoved	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
excited	1
whisper	1
said	1
Fetch	1
it	1
Laska	1
Well	1
if	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
he	1
wishes	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
answer	1
for	1
myself	1
now	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
darted	1
forward	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
her	1
legs	1
would	1
carry	1
her	1
between	1
the	1
thick	1
bushes	1
She	1
scented	1
nothing	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
without	1
understanding	1
anything	1
Ten	1
paces	1
from	1
her	1
former	1
place	1
a	1
grouse	1
rose	1
with	1
a	1
guttural	1
cry	1
and	1
the	1
peculiar	1
round	1
sound	1
of	1
its	1
wings	1
And	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
shot	1
it	1
splashed	1
heavily	1
with	1
its	1
white	1
breast	1
on	1
the	1
wet	1
mire	1
Another	1
bird	1
did	1
not	1
linger	1
but	1
rose	1
behind	1
Levin	1
without	1
the	1
dog	1
When	1
Levin	1
turned	1
towards	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
some	1
way	1
off	1
But	1
his	1
shot	1
caught	1
it	1
Flying	1
twenty	1
paces	1
further	1
the	1
second	1
grouse	1
rose	1
upwards	1
and	1
whirling	1
round	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
dropped	1
heavily	1
on	1
a	1
dry	1
place	1
Come	1
this	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
good	1
thought	1
Levin	1
packing	1
the	1
warm	1
and	1
fat	1
grouse	1
into	1
his	1
game	1
bag	1
Eh	1
Laska	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
When	1
Levin	1
after	1
loading	1
his	1
gun	1
moved	1
on	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
fully	1
risen	1
though	1
unseen	1
behind	1
the	1
storm	1
clouds	1
The	1
moon	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
of	1
its	1
luster	1
and	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
white	1
cloud	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
star	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
The	1
sedge	1
silvery	1
with	1
dew	1
before	1
now	1
shone	1
like	1
gold	1
The	1
stagnant	1
pools	1
were	1
all	1
like	1
amber	1
The	1
blue	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
had	1
changed	1
to	1
yellow	1
green	1
The	1
marsh	1
birds	1
twittered	1
and	1
swarmed	1
about	1
the	1
brook	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
bushes	1
that	1
glittered	1
with	1
dew	1
and	1
cast	1
long	1
shadows	1
A	1
hawk	1
woke	1
up	1
and	1
settled	1
on	1
a	1
haycock	1
turning	1
its	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
and	1
looking	1
discontentedly	1
at	1
the	1
marsh	1
Crows	1
were	1
flying	1
about	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
a	1
bare	1
legged	1
boy	1
was	1
driving	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
long	1
coat	1
and	1
was	1
combing	1
his	1
hair	1
The	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
gun	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
milk	1
over	1
the	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
Levin	1
Uncle	1
there	1
were	1
ducks	1
here	1
yesterday	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
off	1
behind	1
him	1
And	1
Levin	1
was	1
doubly	1
pleased	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
boy	1
who	1
expressed	1
his	1
approval	1
at	1
killing	1
three	1
snipe	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
straight	1
off	1

Levin	1
weary	1
hungry	1
and	1
happy	1
after	1
a	1
tramp	1
of	1
twenty	1
miles	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
night	1
s	1
lodging	1
with	1
nineteen	1
head	1
of	1
fine	1
game	1
and	1
one	1
duck	1
which	1
he	1
tied	1
to	1
his	1
belt	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
game	1
bag	1
His	1
companions	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
awake	1
and	1
had	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
hungry	1
and	1
have	1
breakfast	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
I	1
know	1
there	1
are	1
nineteen	1
said	1
Levin	1
counting	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
over	1
the	1
grouse	1
and	1
snipe	1
that	1
looked	1
so	1
much	1
less	1
important	1
now	1
bent	1
and	1
dry	1
and	1
bloodstained	1
with	1
heads	1
crooked	1
aside	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
flying	1
The	1
number	1
was	1
verified	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
envy	1
pleased	1
Levin	1
He	1
was	1
pleased	1
too	1
on	1
returning	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
by	1
Kitty	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
was	1
already	1
there	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
well	1
and	1
happy	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
uneasy	1
about	1
me	1
you	1
can	1
feel	1
easier	1
than	1
ever	1
I	1
ve	1
a	1
new	1
bodyguard	1
Marya	1
Vlasyevna	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
midwife	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
important	1
personage	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
domestic	1
life	1
She	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
She	1
found	1
me	1
perfectly	1
well	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
kept	1
her	1
till	1
you	1
are	1
back	1
All	1
are	1
happy	1
and	1
well	1
and	1
please	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
sport	1
is	1
good	1
stay	1
another	1
day	1
These	1
two	1
pleasures	1
his	1
lucky	1
shooting	1
and	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
two	1
slightly	1
disagreeable	1
incidents	1
passed	1
lightly	1
over	1
Levin	1
One	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
chestnut	1
trace	1
horse	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
unmistakably	1
overworked	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
was	1
off	1
his	1
feed	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
sorts	1
The	1
coachman	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
Overdriven	1
yesterday	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Yes	1
indeed	1
driven	1
ten	1
miles	1
with	1
no	1
sense	1
The	1
other	1
unpleasant	1
incident	1
which	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
destroyed	1
his	1
good	1
humor	1
though	1
later	1
he	1
laughed	1
at	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
provisions	1
Kitty	1
had	1
provided	1
in	1
such	1
abundance	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
nothing	1
was	1
left	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
tired	1
and	1
hungry	1
from	1
shooting	1
Levin	1
had	1
so	1
distinct	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
meat	1
pies	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
smell	1
and	1
taste	1
them	1
as	1
Laska	1
had	1
smelt	1
the	1
game	1
and	1
he	1
immediately	1
told	1
Philip	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
pies	1
left	1
nor	1
even	1
any	1
chicken	1
Well	1
this	1
fellow	1
s	1
appetite	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
laughing	1
and	1
pointing	1
at	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
I	1
never	1
suffer	1
from	1
loss	1
of	1
appetite	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
really	1
marvelous	1
Well	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
said	1
Levin	1
looking	1
gloomily	1
at	1
Veslovsky	1
Well	1
Philip	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
beef	1
then	1
The	1
beef	1
s	1
been	1
eaten	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
dogs	1
answered	1
Philip	1
Levin	1
was	1
so	1
hurt	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
vexation	1
You	1
might	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
something	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
Then	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
game	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
to	1
Philip	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Vassenka	1
and	1
cover	1
them	1
with	1
some	1
nettles	1
And	1
you	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
ask	1
for	1
some	1
milk	1
for	1
me	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
some	1
milk	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
immediately	1
at	1
having	1
shown	1
his	1
annoyance	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
his	1
hungry	1
mortification	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
they	1
went	1
shooting	1
again	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
had	1
several	1
successful	1
shots	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
drove	1
home	1
Their	1
homeward	1
journey	1
was	1
as	1
lively	1
as	1
their	1
drive	1
out	1
had	1
been	1
Veslovsky	1
sang	1
songs	1
and	1
related	1
with	1
enjoyment	1
his	1
adventures	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
regaled	1
him	1
with	1
vodka	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
Excuse	1
our	1
homely	1
ways	1
and	1
his	1
night	1
s	1
adventures	1
with	1
kiss	1
in	1
the	1
ring	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
girl	1
and	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
was	1
he	1
married	1
and	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
Well	1
mind	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
run	1
after	1
other	1
men	1
s	1
wives	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
get	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
These	1
words	1
had	1
particularly	1
amused	1
Veslovsky	1
Altogether	1
I	1
ve	1
enjoyed	1
our	1
outing	1
awfully	1
And	1
you	1
Levin	1
I	1
have	1
very	1
much	1
Levin	1
said	1
quite	1
sincerely	1
It	1
was	1
particularly	1
delightful	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
hostility	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
feeling	1
towards	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
to	1
feel	1
instead	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
disposition	1
to	1
him	1
Chapter	1

Next	1
day	1
at	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
Levin	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
his	1
rounds	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Vassenka	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
Entrez	1
	1
Veslovsky	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
Excuse	1
me	1
I	1
ve	1
only	1
just	1
finished	1
my	1
ablutions	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
standing	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
underclothes	1
only	1
Don	1
t	1
mind	1
me	1
please	1
Levin	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
Have	1
you	1
slept	1
well	1
Like	1
the	1
dead	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
day	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
shooting	1
What	1
will	1
you	1
take	1
tea	1
or	1
coffee	1
Neither	1
I	1
ll	1
wait	1
till	1
lunch	1
I	1
m	1
really	1
ashamed	1
I	1
suppose	1
the	1
ladies	1
are	1
down	1
A	1
walk	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
capital	1
You	1
show	1
me	1
your	1
horses	1
After	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
visiting	1
the	1
stable	1
and	1
even	1
doing	1
some	1
gymnastic	1
exercises	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
parallel	1
bars	1
Levin	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
his	1
guest	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
We	1
had	1
splendid	1
shooting	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
delightful	1
experiences	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Kitty	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
samovar	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
ladies	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
these	1
delights	1
Well	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
must	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
Again	1
he	1
fancied	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
smile	1
in	1
the	1
all	1
conquering	1
air	1
with	1
which	1
their	1
guest	1
addressed	1
Kitty	1
The	1
princess	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
Marya	1
Vlasyevna	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
called	1
Levin	1
to	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
moving	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
Kitty	1
s	1
confinement	1
and	1
getting	1
ready	1
rooms	1
for	1
them	1
Just	1
as	1
Levin	1
had	1
disliked	1
all	1
the	1
trivial	1
preparations	1
for	1
his	1
wedding	1
as	1
derogatory	1
to	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
now	1
he	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
offensive	1
the	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
birth	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
reckoned	1
it	1
seemed	1
on	1
their	1
fingers	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
deaf	1
ear	1
to	1
these	1
discussions	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
patterns	1
of	1
long	1
clothes	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
baby	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
and	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
the	1
mysterious	1
endless	1
strips	1
of	1
knitting	1
the	1
triangles	1
of	1
linen	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
which	1
Dolly	1
attached	1
special	1
importance	1
The	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
son	1
he	1
was	1
certain	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
son	1
which	1
was	1
promised	1
him	1
but	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
so	1
marvelous	1
it	1
seemed	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
one	1
hand	1
as	1
a	1
happiness	1
so	1
immense	1
and	1
therefore	1
so	1
incredible	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
an	1
event	1
so	1
mysterious	1
that	1
this	1
assumption	1
of	1
a	1
definite	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
and	1
consequent	1
preparation	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
for	1
something	1
ordinary	1
that	1
did	1
happen	1
to	1
people	1
jarred	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
confusing	1
and	1
humiliating	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
his	1
feelings	1
and	1
put	1
down	1
his	1
reluctance	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
carelessness	1
and	1
indifference	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
peace	1
She	1
had	1
commissioned	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
flat	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
called	1
Levin	1
up	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
princess	1
Do	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
fit	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
must	1
decide	1
when	1
you	1
will	1
move	1
I	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
millions	1
of	1
children	1
are	1
born	1
away	1
from	1
Moscow	1
and	1
doctors	1
why	1
But	1
if	1
so	1
Oh	1
no	1
as	1
Kitty	1
wishes	1
We	1
can	1
t	1
talk	1
to	1
Kitty	1
about	1
it	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
frighten	1
her	1
Why	1
this	1
spring	1
Natalia	1
Golitzina	1
died	1
from	1
having	1
an	1
ignorant	1
doctor	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
just	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
he	1
said	1
gloomily	1
The	1
princess	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
Though	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
had	1
indeed	1
jarred	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
gloomy	1
not	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
that	1
conversation	1
but	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
samovar	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
impossible	1
he	1
thought	1
glancing	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
Vassenka	1
bending	1
over	1
Kitty	1
telling	1
her	1
something	1
with	1
his	1
charming	1
smile	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
flushed	1
and	1
disturbed	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
nice	1
in	1
Vassenka	1
s	1
attitude	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
his	1
smile	1
Levin	1
even	1
saw	1
something	1
not	1
nice	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
attitude	1
and	1
look	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
light	1
died	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
Again	1
as	1
before	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
transition	1
he	1
felt	1
cast	1
down	1
from	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
happiness	1
peace	1
and	1
dignity	1
into	1
an	1
abyss	1
of	1
despair	1
rage	1
and	1
humiliation	1
Again	1
everything	1
and	1
everyone	1
had	1
become	1
hateful	1
to	1
him	1
You	1
do	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
best	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
again	1
looking	1
round	1
Heavy	1
is	1
the	1
cap	1
of	1
Monomach	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
playfully	1
hinting	1
evidently	1
not	1
simply	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
conversation	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
agitation	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
How	1
late	1
you	1
are	1
today	1
Dolly	1
Everyone	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
greet	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Vassenka	1
only	1
rose	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
courtesy	1
to	1
ladies	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
scarcely	1
bowed	1
and	1
resumed	1
his	1
conversation	1
again	1
laughing	1
at	1
something	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
worried	1
about	1
Masha	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
well	1
and	1
is	1
dreadfully	1
tiresome	1
today	1
said	1
Dolly	1
The	1
conversation	1
Vassenka	1
had	1
started	1
with	1
Kitty	1
was	1
running	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
lines	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
discussing	1
Anna	1
and	1
whether	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
higher	1
than	1
worldly	1
considerations	1
Kitty	1
disliked	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
disturbed	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
the	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
conducted	1
and	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
on	1
her	1
husband	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
and	1
innocent	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
this	1
conversation	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
superficial	1
pleasure	1
afforded	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
s	1
very	1
obvious	1
admiration	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
stop	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
Whatever	1
she	1
did	1
she	1
knew	1
would	1
be	1
observed	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
interpretation	1
put	1
on	1
it	1
And	1
in	1
fact	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
what	1
was	1
wrong	1
with	1
Masha	1
and	1
Vassenka	1
waiting	1
till	1
this	1
uninteresting	1
conversation	1
was	1
over	1
began	1
to	1
gaze	1
indifferently	1
at	1
Dolly	1
the	1
question	1
struck	1
Levin	1
as	1
an	1
unnatural	1
and	1
disgusting	1
piece	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
mushrooms	1
today	1
said	1
Dolly	1
By	1
all	1
means	1
please	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
too	1
said	1
Kitty	1
and	1
she	1
blushed	1
She	1
wanted	1
from	1
politeness	1
to	1
ask	1
Vassenka	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
Kostya	1
she	1
asked	1
her	1
husband	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
resolute	1
step	1
This	1
guilty	1
air	1
confirmed	1
all	1
his	1
suspicions	1
The	1
mechanician	1
came	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
away	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
seen	1
him	1
yet	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
He	1
went	1
downstairs	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
study	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
familiar	1
footsteps	1
running	1
with	1
reckless	1
speed	1
to	1
him	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
shortly	1
We	1
are	1
busy	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
German	1
mechanician	1
I	1
want	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
with	1
my	1
husband	1
The	1
German	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
Don	1
t	1
disturb	1
yourself	1
The	1
train	1
is	1
at	1
three	1
queried	1
the	1
German	1
I	1
mustn	1
t	1
be	1
late	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
but	1
walked	1
out	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Well	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
French	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
in	1
her	1
condition	1
was	1
trembling	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
piteous	1
crushed	1
look	1
I	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
misery	1
she	1
said	1
The	1
servants	1
are	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
sideboard	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
don	1
t	1
make	1
a	1
scene	1
Well	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
in	1
here	1
They	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
Kitty	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
but	1
there	1
the	1
English	1
governess	1
was	1
giving	1
Tanya	1
a	1
lesson	1
Well	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
In	1
the	1
garden	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
peasant	1
weeding	1
the	1
path	1
And	1
no	1
longer	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
peasant	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
tear	1
stained	1
and	1
his	1
agitated	1
face	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
people	1
fleeing	1
from	1
some	1
disaster	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps	1
feeling	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
speak	1
out	1
and	1
clear	1
up	1
misunderstandings	1
must	1
be	1
alone	1
together	1
and	1
so	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
misery	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
feeling	1
We	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
It	1
s	1
misery	1
I	1
am	1
wretched	1
you	1
are	1
wretched	1
What	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
reached	1
a	1
solitary	1
garden	1
seat	1
at	1
a	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
lime	1
tree	1
avenue	1
But	1
tell	1
me	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
his	1
tone	1
anything	1
unseemly	1
not	1
nice	1
humiliatingly	1
horrible	1
he	1
said	1
standing	1
before	1
her	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
with	1
his	1
clenched	1
fists	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
before	1
her	1
that	1
night	1
Yes	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
shaking	1
voice	1
but	1
Kostya	1
surely	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
All	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
tone	1
but	1
such	1
people	1
Why	1
did	1
he	1
come	1
How	1
happy	1
we	1
were	1
she	1
said	1
breathless	1
with	1
the	1
sobs	1
that	1
shook	1
her	1
Although	1
nothing	1
had	1
been	1
pursuing	1
them	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
found	1
anything	1
very	1
delightful	1
on	1
that	1
garden	1
seat	1
the	1
gardener	1
saw	1
with	1
astonishment	1
that	1
they	1
passed	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
home	1
with	1
comforted	1
and	1
radiant	1
faces	1
Chapter	1
15	1
After	1
escorting	1
his	1
wife	1
upstairs	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
Dolly	1
s	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
was	1
in	1
great	1
distress	1
too	1
that	1
day	1
She	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
talking	1
angrily	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
roaring	1
And	1
you	1
shall	1
stand	1
all	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
have	1
your	1
dinner	1
all	1
alone	1
and	1
not	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
dolls	1
and	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
new	1
frock	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
punish	1
her	1
Oh	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
disgusting	1
child	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Levin	1
Where	1
does	1
she	1
get	1
such	1
wicked	1
propensities	1
Why	1
what	1
has	1
she	1
done	1
Levin	1
said	1
without	1
much	1
interest	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
advice	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
annoyed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
an	1
unlucky	1
moment	1
Grisha	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
raspberries	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
you	1
really	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
thousand	1
pities	1
Miss	1
Elliot	1
s	1
not	1
with	1
us	1
This	1
one	1
sees	1
to	1
nothing	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
machine	1
Figurez	1
vous	1
que	1
la	1
petite	1
And	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
described	1
Masha	1
s	1
crime	1
That	1
proves	1
nothing	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
evil	1
propensities	1
at	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
simply	1
mischief	1
Levin	1
assured	1
her	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
upset	1
about	1
something	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
for	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
What	1
s	1
going	1
on	1
there	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
question	1
Levin	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
there	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
Kitty	1
We	1
ve	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
for	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
since	1
Stiva	1
came	1
Dolly	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
shrewd	1
comprehending	1
eyes	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
honor	1
bright	1
has	1
there	1
been	1
not	1
in	1
Kitty	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
gentleman	1
s	1
behavior	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
unpleasant	1
not	1
unpleasant	1
but	1
horrible	1
offensive	1
to	1
a	1
husband	1
You	1
mean	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
Stay	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Masha	1
who	1
detecting	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
in	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
face	1
had	1
been	1
turning	1
round	1
The	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
behaving	1
as	1
young	1
men	1
do	1
behave	1
Il	1
fait	1
la	1
cour	1
`a	1
une	1
jeune	1
et	1
jolie	1
femme	1
and	1
a	1
husband	1
who	1
s	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
only	1
be	1
flattered	1
by	1
it	1
Yes	1
yes	1
said	1
Levin	1
gloomily	1
but	1
you	1
noticed	1
it	1
Not	1
only	1
I	1
but	1
Stiva	1
noticed	1
it	1
Just	1
after	1
breakfast	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
words	1
Je	1
crois	1
que	1
Veslovsky	1
fait	1
un	1
petit	1
brin	1
de	1
cour	1
`a	1
Kitty	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
then	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
satisfied	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
him	1
away	1
said	1
Levin	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Are	1
you	1
crazy	1
Dolly	1
cried	1
in	1
horror	1
nonsense	1
Kostya	1
only	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
laughing	1
You	1
can	1
go	1
now	1
to	1
Fanny	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Masha	1
No	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it	1
I	1
ll	1
speak	1
to	1
Stiva	1
He	1
ll	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
He	1
can	1
say	1
you	1
re	1
expecting	1
visitors	1
Altogether	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
fit	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
No	1
no	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
it	1
myself	1
But	1
you	1
ll	1
quarrel	1
with	1
him	1
Not	1
a	1
bit	1
I	1
shall	1
so	1
enjoy	1
it	1
Levin	1
said	1
his	1
eyes	1
flashing	1
with	1
real	1
enjoyment	1
Come	1
forgive	1
her	1
Dolly	1
she	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
sinner	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
Fanny	1
but	1
was	1
standing	1
irresolutely	1
before	1
her	1
mother	1
waiting	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
to	1
catch	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
eye	1
The	1
mother	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
The	1
child	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
on	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
lap	1
and	1
Dolly	1
laid	1
her	1
thin	1
tender	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
common	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
him	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
Veslovsky	1
As	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
ready	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
The	1
spring	1
was	1
broken	1
yesterday	1
said	1
the	1
footman	1
Well	1
the	1
covered	1
trap	1
then	1
and	1
make	1
haste	1
Where	1
s	1
the	1
visitor	1
The	1
gentleman	1
s	1
gone	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
Levin	1
came	1
upon	1
Veslovsky	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
having	1
unpacked	1
his	1
things	1
from	1
his	1
trunk	1
and	1
laid	1
out	1
some	1
new	1
songs	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
gaiters	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
riding	1
Whether	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
exceptional	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
face	1
or	1
that	1
Vassenka	1
was	1
himself	1
conscious	1
that	1
ce	1
petit	1
brin	1
de	1
cour	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
this	1
family	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
society	1
can	1
be	1
disconcerted	1
at	1
Levin	1
s	1
entrance	1
You	1
ride	1
in	1
gaiters	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
much	1
cleaner	1
said	1
Vassenka	1
putting	1
his	1
fat	1
leg	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
fastening	1
the	1
bottom	1
hook	1
and	1
smiling	1
with	1
simple	1
hearted	1
good	1
humor	1
He	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
and	1
Levin	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
host	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
shy	1
look	1
on	1
Vassenka	1
s	1
face	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
lay	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
stick	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
broken	1
together	1
that	1
morning	1
trying	1
their	1
strength	1
Levin	1
took	1
the	1
fragment	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
began	1
smashing	1
it	1
up	1
breaking	1
bits	1
off	1
the	1
stick	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
begin	1
I	1
wanted	1
He	1
paused	1
but	1
suddenly	1
remembering	1
Kitty	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
him	1
resolutely	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
I	1
have	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
for	1
you	1
How	1
so	1
Vassenka	1
began	1
in	1
surprise	1
To	1
drive	1
where	1
For	1
you	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
Levin	1
said	1
gloomily	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
away	1
or	1
has	1
something	1
happened	1
It	1
happens	1
that	1
I	1
expect	1
visitors	1
said	1
Levin	1
his	1
strong	1
fingers	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rapidly	1
breaking	1
off	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
split	1
stick	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
expecting	1
visitors	1
and	1
nothing	1
has	1
happened	1
but	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
You	1
can	1
explain	1
my	1
rudeness	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
Vassenka	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
explain	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
dignity	1
understanding	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
explain	1
Levin	1
said	1
softly	1
and	1
deliberately	1
trying	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
trembling	1
of	1
his	1
jaw	1
and	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
ask	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
split	1
ends	1
were	1
all	1
broken	1
off	1
Levin	1
clutched	1
the	1
thick	1
ends	1
in	1
his	1
finger	1
broke	1
the	1
stick	1
in	1
two	1
and	1
carefully	1
caught	1
the	1
end	1
as	1
it	1
fell	1
Probably	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
nervous	1
fingers	1
of	1
the	1
muscles	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
that	1
morning	1
at	1
gymnastics	1
of	1
the	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
the	1
soft	1
voice	1
and	1
quivering	1
jaws	1
convinced	1
Vassenka	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
words	1
He	1
bowed	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
smiling	1
contemptuously	1
Can	1
I	1
not	1
see	1
Oblonsky	1
The	1
shrug	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
did	1
not	1
irritate	1
Levin	1
What	1
else	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
thought	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
at	1
once	1
What	1
madness	1
is	1
this	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
when	1
after	1
hearing	1
from	1
his	1
friend	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
found	1
Levin	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
guest	1

What	1
did	1
you	1
think	1
if	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
But	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
stung	1
was	1
evidently	1
still	1
sore	1
for	1
he	1
turned	1
pale	1
again	1
when	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
would	1
have	1
enlarged	1
on	1
the	1
reason	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
into	1
it	1
I	1
can	1

help	1
it	1
I	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
of	1
how	1
I	1
m	1
treating	1
you	1
and	1
him	1
But	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
I	1
imagine	1
a	1
great	1
grief	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
distasteful	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
But	1
it	1
s	1
insulting	1
to	1
him	1
Et	1

And	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
s	1
both	1
insulting	1
and	1
distressing	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
at	1

in	1
any	1
way	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
no	1

Levin	1
turned	1
quickly	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
alone	1
Soon	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
saw	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
trees	1
how	1
Vassenka	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
hay	1
unluckily	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
in	1
his	1
Scotch	1
cap	1
was	1
driven	1
along	1
the	1
avenue	1
jolting	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
ruts	1
What	1
s	1
this	1
Levin	1
thought	1
when	1
a	1
footman	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
stopped	1
the	1
trap	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
mechanician	1
whom	1
Levin	1
had	1
totally	1
forgotten	1
The	1
mechanician	1
bowing	1
low	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
then	1
clambered	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
they	1
drove	1
off	1
together	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
were	1
much	1
upset	1
by	1
Levin	1
s	1
action	1
And	1
he	1
himself	1
felt	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
ridicule	1
but	1
also	1
utterly	1
guilty	1
and	1
disgraced	1
But	1
remembering	1
what	1
sufferings	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
been	1
through	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
how	1
he	1
should	1
act	1
another	1
time	1
he	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
again	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
everyone	1
except	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
pardon	1
Levin	1
s	1
action	1
became	1
extraordinarily	1
lively	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
like	1
children	1
after	1
a	1
punishment	1
or	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
after	1
a	1
dreary	1
ceremonious	1
reception	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
Vassenka	1
s	1
dismissal	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
some	1
remote	1
event	1
And	1
Dolly	1
who	1
had	1
inherited	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
gift	1
of	1
humorous	1
storytelling	1
made	1
Varenka	1
helpless	1
with	1
laughter	1
as	1
she	1
related	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
time	1
always	1
with	1
fresh	1
humorous	1
additions	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
new	1
shoes	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
visitor	1
and	1
on	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
heard	1
suddenly	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
And	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
but	1
Vassenka	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
Scotch	1
cap	1
and	1
his	1
songs	1
and	1
his	1
gaiters	1
and	1
all	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
hay	1
If	1
only	1
you	1
d	1
ordered	1
out	1
the	1
carriage	1
But	1
no	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
hear	1
Stop	1
Oh	1
I	1
thought	1
they	1
ve	1
relented	1
I	1
look	1
out	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
fat	1
German	1
being	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
driving	1
away	1
And	1
my	1
new	1
shoes	1
all	1
for	1
nothing	1
Chapter	1
16	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
carried	1
out	1
her	1
intention	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
She	1
was	1
sorry	1
to	1
annoy	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
Levin	1
disliked	1
She	1
quite	1
understood	1
how	1
right	1
the	1
Levins	1
were	1
in	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
But	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
Anna	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
feelings	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
That	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
Levins	1
in	1
this	1
expedition	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
hire	1
horses	1
for	1
the	1
drive	1
but	1
Levin	1
learning	1
of	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
protest	1
What	1
makes	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
dislike	1
your	1
going	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
dislike	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
still	1
more	1
dislike	1
your	1
not	1
taking	1
my	1
horses	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
never	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
for	1
certain	1
Hiring	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
is	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
they	1
ll	1
undertake	1
the	1
job	1
and	1
never	1
get	1
you	1
there	1
I	1
have	1
horses	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
wound	1
me	1
you	1
ll	1
take	1
mine	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
to	1
consent	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
Levin	1
had	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
four	1
horses	1
and	1
relays	1
getting	1
them	1
together	1
from	1
the	1
farm	1
and	1
saddle	1
horses	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
a	1
smart	1
looking	1
set	1
but	1
capable	1
of	1
taking	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
the	1
whole	1
distance	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
day	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
when	1
horses	1
were	1
wanted	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
midwife	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
difficult	1
matter	1
for	1
Levin	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
number	1
but	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
hospitality	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
allow	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
to	1
hire	1
horses	1
when	1
staying	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
Moreover	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
twenty	1
roubles	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
were	1
a	1
serious	1
matter	1
for	1
her	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
pecuniary	1
affairs	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
unsatisfactory	1
state	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
heart	1
by	1
the	1
Levins	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
their	1
own	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
by	1
Levin	1
s	1
advice	1
started	1
before	1
daybreak	1
The	1
road	1
was	1
good	1
the	1
carriage	1
comfortable	1
the	1
horses	1
trotted	1
along	1
merrily	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
besides	1
the	1
coachman	1
sat	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
whom	1
Levin	1
was	1
sending	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
groom	1
for	1
greater	1
security	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
dozed	1
and	1
waked	1
up	1
only	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
inn	1
where	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
changed	1
After	1
drinking	1
tea	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
well	1
to	1
do	1
peasant	1
s	1
with	1
whom	1
Levin	1
had	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
and	1
chatting	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
about	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
about	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
whom	1
the	1
latter	1
praised	1
very	1
highly	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
at	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
At	1
home	1
looking	1
after	1
her	1
children	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
So	1
now	1
after	1
this	1
journey	1
of	1
four	1
hours	1
all	1
the	1
thoughts	1
she	1
had	1
suppressed	1
before	1
rushed	1
swarming	1
into	1
her	1
brain	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
over	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
as	1
she	1
never	1
had	1
before	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
different	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
seemed	1
strange	1
even	1
to	1
herself	1
At	1
first	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
the	1
children	1
about	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
uneasy	1
although	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Kitty	1
she	1
reckoned	1
more	1
upon	1
her	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
them	1
If	1
only	1
Masha	1
does	1
not	1
begin	1
her	1
naughty	1
tricks	1
if	1
Grisha	1
isn	1
t	1
kicked	1
by	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
Lily	1
s	1
stomach	1
isn	1
t	1
upset	1
again	1
she	1
thought	1
But	1
these	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
were	1
succeeded	1
by	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
immediate	1
future	1
She	1
began	1
thinking	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
new	1
flat	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
winter	1
to	1
renew	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
furniture	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
elder	1
girl	1
a	1
cloak	1
Then	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
remote	1
future	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
place	1
her	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
The	1
girls	1
are	1
all	1
right	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
the	1
boys	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
teaching	1
Grisha	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
s	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
myself	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
with	1
child	1
Stiva	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
counting	1
on	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
good	1
natured	1
friends	1
I	1
can	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
another	1
baby	1
coming	1
And	1
the	1
thought	1
struck	1
her	1
how	1
untruly	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
curse	1
laid	1
on	1
woman	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
sorrow	1
she	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
children	1
The	1
birth	1
itself	1
that	1
s	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
months	1
of	1
carrying	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
s	1
so	1
intolerable	1
she	1
thought	1
picturing	1
to	1
herself	1
her	1
last	1
pregnancy	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
baby	1
And	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
On	1
being	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
any	1
children	1
the	1
handsome	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
answered	1
cheerfully	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
girl	1
baby	1
but	1
God	1
set	1
me	1
free	1
I	1
buried	1
her	1
last	1
Lent	1
Well	1
did	1
you	1
grieve	1
very	1
much	1
for	1
her	1
asked	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Why	1
grieve	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
has	1
grandchildren	1
enough	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
trouble	1
No	1
working	1
nor	1
nothing	1
Only	1
a	1
tie	1
This	1
answer	1
had	1
struck	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
as	1
revolting	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
natured	1
and	1
pleasing	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
recalling	1
these	1
words	1
In	1
those	1
cynical	1
words	1
there	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
truth	1
Yes	1
altogether	1
thought	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
looking	1
back	1
over	1
her	1
whole	1
existence	1
during	1
those	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
married	1
life	1
pregnancy	1
sickness	1
mental	1
incapacity	1
indifference	1
to	1
everything	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
hideousness	1
Kitty	1
young	1
and	1
pretty	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
even	1
Kitty	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
I	1
when	1
I	1
m	1
with	1
child	1
become	1
hideous	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
The	1
birth	1
the	1
agony	1
the	1
hideous	1
agonies	1
that	1
last	1
moment	1
then	1
the	1
nursing	1
the	1
sleepless	1
nights	1
the	1
fearful	1
pains	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
from	1
sore	1
breasts	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
with	1
almost	1
every	1
child	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
illnesses	1
that	1
everlasting	1
apprehension	1
then	1
bringing	1
them	1
up	1
evil	1
propensities	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
little	1
Masha	1
s	1
crime	1
among	1
the	1
raspberries	1
education	1
Latin	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
difficult	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
these	1
children	1
And	1
there	1
rose	1
again	1
before	1
her	1
imagination	1
the	1
cruel	1
memory	1
that	1
always	1
tore	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
last	1
little	1
baby	1
who	1
had	1
died	1
of	1
croup	1
his	1
funeral	1
the	1
callous	1
indifference	1
of	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
pink	1
coffin	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
torn	1
heart	1
and	1
her	1
lonely	1
anguish	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
pale	1
little	1
brow	1
with	1
its	1
projecting	1
temples	1
and	1
the	1
open	1
wondering	1
little	1
mouth	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
coffin	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
being	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
pink	1
lid	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
braided	1
on	1
it	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
what	1
s	1
it	1
for	1
What	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
That	1
I	1
m	1
wasting	1
my	1
life	1
never	1
having	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
peace	1
either	1
with	1
child	1
or	1
nursing	1
a	1
child	1
forever	1
irritable	1
peevish	1
wretched	1
myself	1
and	1
worrying	1
others	1
repulsive	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
growing	1
up	1
unhappy	1
badly	1
educated	1
and	1
penniless	1
Even	1
now	1
if	1
it	1
weren	1
t	1
for	1
spending	1
the	1
summer	1
at	1
the	1
Levins	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
managing	1
to	1
live	1
Of	1
course	1
Kostya	1
and	1
Kitty	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
tact	1
that	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
They	1
ll	1
have	1
children	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
us	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
drag	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
How	1
is	1
papa	1
who	1
has	1
hardly	1
anything	1
left	1
for	1
himself	1
to	1
help	1
us	1
So	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
even	1
bring	1
the	1
children	1
up	1
by	1
myself	1
and	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
hard	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
humiliation	1
Why	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
suppose	1
the	1
greatest	1
good	1
luck	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
don	1
t	1
die	1
and	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
somehow	1
At	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
they	1
ll	1
simply	1
be	1
decent	1
people	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
hope	1
for	1
And	1
to	1
gain	1
simply	1
that	1
what	1
agonies	1
what	1
toil	1
One	1
s	1
whole	1
life	1
ruined	1
Again	1
she	1
recalled	1
what	1
the	1
young	1
peasant	1
woman	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
was	1
revolted	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
admitting	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
brutal	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
Is	1
it	1
far	1
now	1
Mihail	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
asked	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
mind	1
from	1
thoughts	1
that	1
were	1
frightening	1
her	1
From	1
this	1
village	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
five	1
miles	1
The	1
carriage	1
drove	1
along	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
and	1
onto	1
a	1
bridge	1
On	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
peasant	1
women	1
with	1
coils	1
of	1
ties	1
for	1
the	1
sheaves	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
gaily	1
and	1
noisily	1
chattering	1
They	1
stood	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
staring	1
inquisitively	1
at	1
the	1
carriage	1
All	1
the	1
faces	1
turned	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
looked	1
to	1
her	1
healthy	1
and	1
happy	1
making	1
her	1
envious	1
of	1
their	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
life	1
They	1
re	1
all	1
living	1
they	1
re	1
all	1
enjoying	1
life	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
still	1
mused	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
peasant	1
women	1
and	1
was	1
driving	1
uphill	1
again	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
seated	1
comfortably	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
carriage	1
while	1
I	1
let	1
out	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
from	1
prison	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
worries	1
that	1
fret	1
me	1
to	1
death	1
am	1
only	1
looking	1
about	1
me	1
now	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
They	1
all	1
live	1
those	1
peasant	1
women	1
and	1
my	1
sister	1
Natalia	1
and	1
Varenka	1
and	1
Anna	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
but	1
not	1
I	1
And	1
they	1
attack	1
Anna	1
What	1
for	1
am	1
I	1
any	1
better	1
I	1
have	1
anyway	1
a	1
husband	1
I	1
love	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
still	1
I	1
do	1
love	1
him	1
while	1
Anna	1
never	1
loved	1
hers	1
How	1
is	1
she	1
to	1
blame	1
She	1
wants	1
to	1
live	1
God	1
has	1
put	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
Very	1
likely	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
Even	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
sure	1
I	1
did	1
right	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
terrible	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
Moscow	1
I	1
ought	1
then	1
to	1
have	1
cast	1
off	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
have	1
begun	1
my	1
life	1
fresh	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
loved	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
loved	1
in	1
reality	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
any	1
better	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
respect	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
necessary	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
Is	1
that	1
any	1
better	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
could	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
admired	1
I	1
had	1
beauty	1
left	1
me	1
still	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
pursued	1
her	1
thoughts	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
traveling	1
looking	1
glass	1
in	1
her	1
handbag	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
coachman	1
and	1
the	1
swaying	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
ashamed	1
if	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
out	1
the	1
glass	1
But	1
without	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
particularly	1
attentive	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
Stiva	1
s	1
good	1
hearted	1
friend	1
Turovtsin	1
who	1
had	1
helped	1
her	1
nurse	1
her	1
children	1
through	1
the	1
scarlatina	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
someone	1
else	1
a	1
quite	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
joke	1
thought	1
her	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
And	1
the	1
most	1
passionate	1
and	1
impossible	1
romances	1
rose	1
before	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
imagination	1
Anna	1
did	1
quite	1
right	1
and	1
certainly	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
reproach	1
her	1
for	1
it	1
She	1
is	1
happy	1
she	1
makes	1
another	1
person	1
happy	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
not	1
broken	1
down	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
most	1
likely	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
was	1
bright	1
clever	1
open	1
to	1
every	1
impression	1
thought	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
a	1
sly	1
smile	1
curved	1
her	1
lips	1
for	1
as	1
she	1
pondered	1
on	1
Anna	1
s	1
love	1
affair	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
constructed	1
on	1
parallel	1
lines	1
an	1
almost	1
identical	1
love	1
affair	1
for	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
imaginary	1
composite	1
figure	1
the	1
ideal	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
like	1
Anna	1
confessed	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
And	1
the	1
amazement	1
and	1
perplexity	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
at	1
this	1
avowal	1
made	1
her	1
smile	1
In	1
such	1
daydreams	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
turning	1
of	1
the	1
highroad	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
Chapter	1
17	1
The	1
coachman	1
pulled	1
up	1
his	1
four	1
horses	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
rye	1
where	1
some	1
peasants	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
cart	1
The	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
jump	1
down	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
he	1
shouted	1
peremptorily	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
instead	1
and	1
beckoned	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
The	1
wind	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
blow	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
dropped	1
when	1
the	1
carriage	1
stood	1
still	1
gadflies	1
settled	1
on	1
the	1
steaming	1
horses	1
that	1
angrily	1
shook	1
them	1
off	1
The	1
metallic	1
clank	1
of	1
a	1
whetstone	1
against	1
a	1
scythe	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
ceased	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
towards	1
the	1
carriage	1
Well	1
you	1
are	1
slow	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
shouted	1
angrily	1
to	1
the	1
peasant	1
who	1
was	1
stepping	1
slowly	1
with	1
his	1
bare	1
feet	1
over	1
the	1
ruts	1
of	1
the	1
rough	1
dry	1
road	1
Come	1
along	1
do	1
A	1
curly	1
headed	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
bast	1
tied	1
round	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
his	1
bent	1
back	1
dark	1
with	1
perspiration	1
came	1
towards	1
the	1
carriage	1
quickening	1
his	1
steps	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
mud	1
guard	1
with	1
his	1
sunburnt	1
hand	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
the	1
manor	1
house	1
the	1
count	1
s	1
he	1
repeated	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
track	1
Then	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
Straight	1
along	1
the	1
avenue	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
right	1
upon	1
it	1
But	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
The	1
count	1
himself	1
Well	1
are	1
they	1
at	1
home	1
my	1
good	1
man	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
said	1
vaguely	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
Anna	1
even	1
of	1
this	1
peasant	1
At	1
home	1
for	1
sure	1
said	1
the	1
peasant	1
shifting	1
from	1
one	1
bare	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
leaving	1
a	1
distinct	1
print	1
of	1
five	1
toes	1
and	1
a	1
heel	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
Sure	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
he	1
repeated	1
evidently	1
eager	1
to	1
talk	1
Only	1
yesterday	1
visitors	1
arrived	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
sight	1
of	1
visitors	1
come	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
He	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
a	1
lad	1
who	1
was	1
shouting	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
Oh	1
They	1
all	1
rode	1
by	1
here	1
not	1
long	1
since	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
reaping	1
machine	1
They	1
ll	1
be	1
home	1
by	1
now	1
And	1
who	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
belonging	1
to	1
We	1
ve	1
come	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
said	1
the	1
coachman	1
climbing	1
onto	1
the	1
box	1
So	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
far	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
here	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
get	1
out	1
he	1
said	1
keeping	1
hold	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
A	1
healthy	1
looking	1
broad	1
shouldered	1
young	1
fellow	1
came	1
up	1
too	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
laborers	1
they	1
want	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
he	1
asked	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
my	1
boy	1
So	1
you	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
right	1
on	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
peasant	1
unmistakably	1
loth	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
travelers	1
go	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
converse	1
The	1
coachman	1
started	1
the	1
horses	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
just	1
turning	1
off	1
when	1
the	1
peasant	1
shouted	1
Stop	1
Hi	1
friend	1
Stop	1
called	1
the	1
two	1
voices	1
The	1
coachman	1
stopped	1
They	1
re	1
coming	1
They	1
re	1
yonder	1
shouted	1
the	1
peasant	1
See	1
what	1
a	1
turn	1
out	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
four	1
persons	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
two	1
in	1
a	1
char	1
`a	1
banc	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
They	1
were	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
a	1
jockey	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
and	1
Sviazhsky	1
in	1
the	1
char	1
`a	1

They	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
reaping	1
machine	1
When	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped	1
the	1
party	1
on	1
horseback	1
were	1
coming	1
at	1
a	1
walking	1
pace	1
Anna	1
was	1
in	1

quietly	1

all	1
the	1
ease	1
and	1
grace	1
of	1
her	1
deportment	1
impressed	1
Dolly	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
unsuitable	1
for	1
Anna	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
horseback	1
The	1
conception	1
of	1
riding	1
on	1
horseback	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
was	1
in	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
mind	1
associated	1
with	1
ideas	1
of	1
youthful	1
flirtation	1
and	1
frivolity	1
which	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
was	1
unbecoming	1
in	1
Anna	1
s	1
position	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
scrutinized	1
her	1
seeing	1
her	1
closer	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
riding	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
elegance	1
everything	1
was	1
so	1
simple	1
quiet	1
and	1
dignified	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
the	1
dress	1
and	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
Anna	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
natural	1
Beside	1
Anna	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
looking	1
gray	1
cavalry	1
horse	1
was	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
in	1
his	1
Scotch	1
cap	1
with	1
floating	1
ribbons	1
his	1
stout	1
legs	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
obviously	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
appearance	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
could	1
not	1
suppress	1
a	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
as	1
she	1
recognized	1
him	1
Behind	1
rode	1
Vronsky	1
on	1
a	1
dark	1
bay	1
mare	1
obviously	1
heated	1
from	1
galloping	1
He	1
was	1
holding	1
her	1
in	1
pulling	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
After	1
him	1
rode	1
a	1
little	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
jockey	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
char	1
`a	1
banc	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
raven	1
black	1
trotting	1
horse	1
overtook	1
the	1
party	1
on	1
horseback	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
suddenly	1
beamed	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
figure	1
huddled	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
carriage	1
she	1
recognized	1
Dolly	1
She	1
uttered	1
a	1
cry	1
started	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
horse	1
into	1
a	1
gallop	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
carriage	1
she	1
jumped	1
off	1
without	1
assistance	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
her	1
riding	1
habit	1
she	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
greet	1
Dolly	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
and	1
dared	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
How	1
delightful	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
fancy	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
pressing	1
her	1
face	1
against	1
Dolly	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
holding	1
her	1
off	1
and	1
examining	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Here	1
s	1
a	1
delightful	1
surprise	1
Alexey	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
had	1
dismounted	1
and	1
was	1
walking	1
towards	1
them	1
Vronsky	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
tall	1
gray	1
hat	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Dolly	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
glad	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
giving	1
peculiar	1
significance	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
strong	1
white	1
teeth	1
in	1
a	1
smile	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
without	1
getting	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
greeted	1
the	1
visitor	1
by	1
gleefully	1
waving	1
the	1
ribbons	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
That	1
s	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
Anna	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
a	1
glance	1
of	1
inquiry	1
from	1
Dolly	1
as	1
the	1
char	1
`a	1
banc	1
drove	1
up	1
Ah	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
her	1
face	1
betrayed	1
her	1
dissatisfaction	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
was	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
aunt	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
long	1
known	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
respect	1
her	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
had	1
passed	1
her	1
whole	1
life	1
toadying	1
on	1
her	1
rich	1
relations	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
now	1
be	1
sponging	1
on	1
Vronsky	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
mortified	1
Dolly	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
kinship	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
Anna	1
noticed	1
Dolly	1
s	1
expression	1
and	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
it	1
She	1
blushed	1
dropped	1
her	1
riding	1
habit	1
and	1
stumbled	1
over	1
it	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
char	1
`a	1
banc	1
and	1
coldly	1
greeted	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
Sviazhsky	1
too	1
she	1
knew	1
He	1
inquired	1
how	1
his	1
queer	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
wife	1
was	1
and	1
running	1
his	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
ill	1
matched	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
its	1
patched	1
mud	1
guards	1
proposed	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
char	1
`a	1
banc	1
And	1
I	1
ll	1
get	1
into	1
this	1
vehicle	1
he	1
said	1
The	1
horse	1
is	1
quiet	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
drives	1
capitally	1
No	1
stay	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
said	1
Anna	1
coming	1
up	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
taking	1
Dolly	1
s	1
arm	1
she	1
drew	1
her	1
away	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
fairly	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
elegant	1
carriage	1
of	1
a	1
pattern	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
the	1
splendid	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
elegant	1
and	1
gorgeous	1
people	1
surrounding	1
her	1
But	1
what	1
struck	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
Anna	1
whom	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
loved	1
Any	1
other	1
woman	1
a	1
less	1
close	1
observer	1
not	1
knowing	1
Anna	1
before	1
or	1
not	1
having	1
thought	1
as	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
noticed	1
anything	1
special	1
in	1
Anna	1
But	1
now	1
Dolly	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
that	1
temporary	1
beauty	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
women	1
during	1
the	1
moments	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
now	1
in	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
Everything	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
the	1
clearly	1
marked	1
dimples	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks	1
and	1
chin	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
the	1
smile	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fluttered	1
about	1
her	1
face	1
the	1
brilliance	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
the	1
grace	1
and	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
movements	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
even	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
angry	1
friendliness	1
she	1
answered	1
Veslovsky	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
her	1
cob	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
teach	1
it	1
to	1
gallop	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
leg	1
foremost	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
peculiarly	1
fascinating	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
herself	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
it	1
When	1
both	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
a	1
sudden	1
embarrassment	1
came	1
over	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
Anna	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
the	1
intent	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry	1
Dolly	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
Dolly	1
was	1
embarrassed	1
because	1
after	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
phrase	1
about	1
this	1
vehicle	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
dirty	1
old	1
carriage	1
in	1
which	1
Anna	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
The	1
coachman	1
Philip	1
and	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
were	1
experiencing	1
the	1
same	1
sensation	1
The	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
confusion	1
busied	1
himself	1
settling	1
the	1
ladies	1
but	1
Philip	1
the	1
coachman	1
became	1
sullen	1
and	1
was	1
bracing	1
himself	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overawed	1
in	1
future	1
by	1
this	1
external	1
superiority	1
He	1
smiled	1
ironically	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
raven	1
horse	1
and	1
was	1
already	1
deciding	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
this	1
smart	1
trotter	1
in	1
the	1
char	1
`a	1
banc	1
was	1
only	1
good	1
for	1
promenage	1
and	1
wouldn	1
t	1
do	1
thirty	1
miles	1
straight	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
The	1
peasants	1
had	1
all	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
were	1
inquisitively	1
and	1
mirthfully	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
making	1
their	1
comments	1
on	1
it	1
They	1
re	1
pleased	1
too	1
haven	1
t	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
said	1
the	1
curly	1
headed	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
bast	1
round	1
his	1
hair	1
I	1
say	1

in	1

Chapter	1
18	1
Anna	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolly	1
s	1
thin	1
care	1
worn	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
wrinkles	1
filled	1
with	1
dust	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
saying	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
Dolly	1
had	1
got	1
thinner	1
But	1
conscious	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
grown	1
handsomer	1
and	1
that	1
Dolly	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
telling	1
her	1
so	1
she	1
sighed	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
herself	1
You	1
are	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
wondering	1
how	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
Well	1
it	1
s	1
shameful	1
to	1
confess	1
but	1
I	1
I	1
m	1
inexcusably	1
happy	1
Something	1
magical	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
frightened	1
panic	1
stricken	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
you	1
wake	1
up	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
horrors	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
have	1
waked	1
up	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
through	1
the	1
misery	1
the	1
dread	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
past	1
especially	1
since	1
we	1
ve	1
been	1
here	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
so	1
happy	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
smile	1
of	1
inquiry	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolly	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
said	1
Dolly	1
smiling	1
involuntarily	1
speaking	1
more	1
coldly	1
than	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
for	1
you	1
Why	1
haven	1
t	1
you	1
written	1
to	1
me	1
Why	1
Because	1
I	1
hadn	1
t	1
the	1
courage	1
You	1
forget	1
my	1
position	1
To	1
me	1
Hadn	1
t	1
the	1
courage	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
how	1
I	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
wanted	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
later	1
What	1
s	1
this	1
what	1
are	1
all	1
these	1
buildings	1
she	1
asked	1
wanting	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
red	1
and	1
green	1
roofs	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
behind	1
the	1
green	1
hedges	1
of	1
acacia	1
and	1
lilac	1
Quite	1
a	1
little	1
town	1
But	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
No	1
no	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
position	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
asked	1
I	1
consider	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
cob	1
to	1
gallop	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
leg	1
foremost	1
galloped	1
past	1
them	1
bumping	1
heavily	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
short	1
jacket	1
on	1
the	1
chamois	1
leather	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
saddle	1
He	1
s	1
doing	1
it	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
he	1
shouted	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
glance	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
again	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
cut	1
short	1
her	1
thought	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
loved	1
you	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
loves	1
anyone	1
one	1
loves	1
the	1
whole	1
person	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
like	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
Anna	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
friend	1
s	1
face	1
and	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyelids	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
habit	1
Dolly	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
before	1
pondered	1
trying	1
to	1
penetrate	1
the	1
full	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
And	1
obviously	1
interpreting	1
them	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
wished	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
Dolly	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
sins	1
she	1
said	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
these	1
words	1
And	1
Dolly	1
saw	1
that	1
tears	1
stood	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
She	1
pressed	1
Anna	1
s	1
hand	1
in	1
silence	1
Well	1
what	1
are	1
these	1
buildings	1
How	1
many	1
there	1
are	1
of	1
them	1
After	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
she	1
repeated	1
her	1
question	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
houses	1
barns	1
and	1
stables	1
answered	1
Anna	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
park	1
begins	1
It	1
had	1
all	1
gone	1
to	1
ruin	1
but	1
Alexey	1
had	1
everything	1
renewed	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
never	1
expected	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
intensely	1
interested	1
in	1
looking	1
after	1
it	1
But	1
his	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
rich	1
nature	1
Whatever	1
he	1
takes	1
up	1
he	1
does	1
splendidly	1
So	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
bored	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
works	1
with	1
passionate	1
interest	1
He	1
with	1
his	1
temperament	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
become	1
careful	1
and	1
businesslike	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
manager	1
he	1
positively	1
reckons	1
every	1
penny	1
in	1
his	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
But	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
When	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
money	1
She	1
spoke	1
with	1
that	1
gleefully	1
sly	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
women	1
often	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
characteristics	1
only	1
known	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
those	1
they	1
love	1
Do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
big	1
building	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
new	1
hospital	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
cost	1
over	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
that	1
s	1
his	1
hobby	1
just	1
now	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
all	1
came	1
about	1
The	1
peasants	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
meadowland	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
cheaper	1
rate	1
and	1
he	1
refused	1
and	1
I	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
being	1
miserly	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
but	1
everything	1
together	1
he	1
began	1
this	1
hospital	1
to	1
prove	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
miserly	1
about	1
money	1
C	1
est	1
une	1
petitesse	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
but	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
for	1
it	1
And	1
now	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
grandfather	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
nothing	1
changed	1
outside	1
How	1
beautiful	1
said	1
Dolly	1
looking	1
with	1
involuntary	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
house	1
with	1
columns	1
standing	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
different	1
colored	1
greens	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
fine	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
the	1
view	1
is	1
wonderful	1
They	1
drove	1
into	1
a	1
courtyard	1
strewn	1
with	1
gravel	1
and	1
bright	1
with	1
flowers	1
in	1
which	1
two	1
laborers	1
were	1
at	1
work	1
putting	1
an	1
edging	1
of	1
stones	1
round	1
the	1
light	1
mould	1
of	1
a	1
flower	1
bed	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
covered	1
entry	1
Ah	1
they	1
re	1
here	1
already	1
said	1
Anna	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
saddle	1
horses	1
which	1
were	1
just	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
steps	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
horse	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
my	1
cob	1
my	1
favorite	1
Lead	1
him	1
here	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
some	1
sugar	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
count	1
she	1
inquired	1
of	1
two	1
smart	1
footmen	1
who	1
darted	1
out	1
Ah	1
there	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
seeing	1
Vronsky	1
coming	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
with	1
Veslovsky	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
princess	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
French	1
addressing	1
Anna	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
greeted	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
big	1
balcony	1
room	1
Oh	1
no	1
that	1
s	1
too	1
far	1
off	1
Better	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
room	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
more	1
Come	1
let	1
s	1
go	1
up	1
said	1
Anna	1
as	1
she	1
gave	1
her	1
favorite	1
horse	1
the	1
sugar	1
the	1
footman	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
Et	1
vous	1
oubliez	1
votre	1
devoir	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
too	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
Pardon	1
j	1
en	1
ai	1
tout	1
plein	1
les	1
poches	1
he	1
answered	1
smiling	1
putting	1
his	1
fingers	1
in	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket	1
Mais	1
vous	1
venez	1
trop	1
tard	1
she	1
said	1
rubbing	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
on	1
her	1
hand	1
which	1
the	1
horse	1
had	1
made	1
wet	1
in	1
taking	1
the	1
sugar	1
Anna	1
turned	1
to	1
Dolly	1
You	1
can	1
stay	1
some	1
time	1
For	1
one	1
day	1
only	1
That	1
s	1
impossible	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
said	1
Dolly	1
feeling	1
embarrassed	1
both	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
bag	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
her	1
face	1
must	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
dust	1
No	1
Dolly	1
darling	1
Well	1
we	1
ll	1
see	1
Come	1
along	1
come	1
along	1
and	1
Anna	1
led	1
Dolly	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
That	1
room	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
smart	1
guest	1
chamber	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
suggested	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
Anna	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
Dolly	1
would	1
excuse	1
it	1
And	1
this	1
room	1
for	1
which	1
excuse	1
was	1
needed	1
was	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
luxury	1
than	1
any	1
in	1
which	1
Dolly	1
had	1
ever	1
stayed	1
a	1
luxury	1
that	1
reminded	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hotels	1
abroad	1
Well	1
darling	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am	1
Anna	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
riding	1
habit	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
beside	1
Dolly	1
Tell	1
me	1
about	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
Stiva	1
I	1
had	1
only	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
tell	1
one	1
about	1
the	1
children	1
How	1
is	1
my	1
favorite	1
Tanya	1
Quite	1
a	1
big	1
girl	1
I	1
expect	1
Yes	1
she	1
s	1
very	1
tall	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
answered	1
shortly	1
surprised	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
respond	1
so	1
coolly	1
about	1
her	1
children	1
We	1
are	1
having	1
a	1
delightful	1
stay	1
at	1
the	1
Levins	1
she	1
added	1
Oh	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
said	1
Anna	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
despise	1
me	1
You	1
might	1
have	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
Stiva	1
s	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
Alexey	1
s	1
you	1
know	1
she	1
added	1
and	1
suddenly	1
she	1
blushed	1
Yes	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
Dolly	1
answered	1
in	1
confusion	1
But	1
in	1
my	1
delight	1
I	1
m	1
talking	1
nonsense	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
darling	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
said	1
Anna	1
kissing	1
her	1
again	1
You	1
haven	1
t	1
told	1
me	1
yet	1
how	1
and	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
keep	1
wanting	1
to	1
know	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
I	1
shouldn	1
t	1
like	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
people	1
to	1
imagine	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
prove	1
anything	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
prove	1
anything	1
I	1
merely	1
want	1
to	1
live	1
to	1
do	1
no	1
one	1
harm	1
but	1
myself	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
haven	1
t	1
I	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
subject	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
over	1
everything	1
properly	1
later	1
Now	1
I	1

and	1

and	1

Left	1
alone	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
housewife	1
s	1
eye	1
scanned	1
her	1
room	1
All	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
walking	1
through	1
it	1
and	1
all	1
she	1
saw	1
now	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
sumptuousness	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
modern	1
European	1
luxury	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
read	1
in	1
English	1
novels	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
Russia	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Everything	1
was	1
new	1
from	1
the	1
new	1
French	1
hangings	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
to	1
the	1
carpet	1
which	1
covered	1
the	1
whole	1
floor	1
The	1
bed	1
had	1
a	1
spring	1
mattress	1
and	1
a	1
special	1
sort	1
of	1
bolster	1
and	1
silk	1
pillowcases	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
pillows	1
The	1
marble	1
washstand	1
the	1
dressing	1
table	1
the	1
little	1
sofa	1
the	1
tables	1
the	1
bronze	1
clock	1
on	1
the	1
chimney	1
piece	1
the	1
window	1
curtains	1
and	1
the	1
porti`eres	1
were	1
all	1
new	1
and	1
expensive	1
The	1
smart	1
maid	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
offer	1
her	1
services	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
done	1
up	1
high	1
and	1
a	1
gown	1
more	1
fashionable	1
than	1
Dolly	1
s	1
was	1
as	1
new	1
and	1
expensive	1
as	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
liked	1
her	1
neatness	1
her	1
deferential	1
and	1
obliging	1
manners	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
seeing	1
the	1
patched	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
that	1
had	1
unluckily	1
been	1
packed	1
by	1
mistake	1
for	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
patches	1
and	1
darned	1
places	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
proud	1
at	1
home	1
At	1
home	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
clear	1
that	1
for	1
six	1
dressing	1
jackets	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
needed	1
twenty	1
four	1
yards	1
of	1
nainsook	1
at	1
sixteen	1
pence	1
the	1
yard	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
thirty	1
shillings	1
besides	1
the	1
cutting	1
out	1
and	1
making	1
and	1
these	1
thirty	1
shillings	1
had	1
been	1
saved	1
But	1
before	1
the	1
maid	1
she	1
felt	1
if	1
not	1
exactly	1
ashamed	1
at	1
least	1
uncomfortable	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
when	1
Annushka	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
for	1
years	1
walked	1
in	1
The	1
smart	1
maid	1
was	1
sent	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
mistress	1
and	1
Annushka	1
remained	1
with	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Annushka	1
was	1
obviously	1
much	1
pleased	1
at	1
that	1
lady	1
s	1
arrival	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
chatter	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
Dolly	1
observed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
opinion	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
mistress	1
s	1
position	1
especially	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
but	1
Dolly	1
carefully	1
interrupted	1
her	1
whenever	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
this	1
I	1
grew	1
up	1
with	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
my	1
lady	1
s	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
anything	1
Well	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
And	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
there	1
seems	1
so	1
much	1
love	1
Kindly	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
wash	1
now	1
please	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
cut	1
her	1
short	1
Certainly	1
We	1
ve	1
two	1
women	1
kept	1
specially	1
for	1
washing	1
small	1
things	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
linen	1
s	1
done	1
by	1
machinery	1
The	1
count	1
goes	1
into	1
everything	1
himself	1
Ah	1
what	1
a	1
husband	1
Dolly	1
was	1
glad	1
when	1
Anna	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
entrance	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
Annushka	1
s	1
gossip	1
Anna	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
batiste	1
gown	1
Dolly	1
scrutinized	1
that	1
simple	1
gown	1
attentively	1
She	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
at	1
which	1
such	1
simplicity	1
was	1
obtained	1
An	1
old	1
friend	1
said	1
Anna	1
of	1
Annushka	1
Anna	1
was	1
not	1
embarrassed	1
now	1
She	1
was	1
perfectly	1
composed	1
and	1
at	1
ease	1
Dolly	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
completely	1
recovered	1
from	1
the	1
impression	1
her	1
arrival	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
had	1
assumed	1
that	1
superficial	1
careless	1
tone	1
which	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
that	1
compartment	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
deeper	1
feelings	1
and	1
ideas	1
were	1
kept	1
Well	1
Anna	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
little	1
girl	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
Annie	1
This	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
little	1
daughter	1
Anna	1
Very	1
well	1
She	1
has	1
got	1
on	1
wonderfully	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
Come	1
I	1
ll	1
show	1
her	1
to	1
you	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
terrible	1
bother	1
she	1
began	1
telling	1
her	1
over	1
nurses	1
We	1
had	1
an	1
Italian	1
wet	1
nurse	1
A	1
good	1
creature	1
but	1
so	1
stupid	1
We	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
baby	1
is	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
we	1

Dolly	1
was	1
beginning	1
a	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
name	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
would	1
have	1
but	1
noticing	1
a	1
sudden	1
frown	1
on	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
she	1
changed	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
her	1
question	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
manage	1
have	1
you	1
weaned	1
her	1
yet	1
But	1
Anna	1
had	1
understood	1
You	1
didn	1
t	1
mean	1
to	1
ask	1
that	1
You	1
meant	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
her	1
surname	1
Yes	1
That	1
worries	1
Alexey	1
She	1
has	1
no	1
name	1
that	1
is	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
Karenina	1
said	1
Anna	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyelids	1
till	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
but	1
the	1
eyelashes	1
meeting	1
But	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
about	1
all	1
that	1
later	1
her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
brightening	1
Come	1
I	1

She	1
crawls	1
now	1
In	1
the	1
nursery	1
the	1
luxury	1
which	1
had	1
impressed	1
Dolly	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
struck	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
There	1
were	1
little	1
go	1
carts	1
ordered	1
from	1
England	1
and	1
appliances	1
for	1
learning	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
a	1
sofa	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
a	1
billiard	1
table	1
purposely	1
constructed	1
for	1
crawling	1
and	1
swings	1
and	1
baths	1
all	1
of	1
special	1
pattern	1
and	1
modern	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
English	1
solid	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
make	1
and	1
obviously	1
very	1
expensive	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
very	1
light	1
and	1
lofty	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
baby	1
with	1
nothing	1
on	1
but	1
her	1
little	1
smock	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
elbow	1
chair	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
having	1
her	1
dinner	1
of	1
broth	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
spilling	1
all	1
over	1
her	1
little	1
chest	1
The	1
baby	1
was	1
being	1
fed	1
and	1
the	1
Russian	1
nursery	1
maid	1
was	1
evidently	1
sharing	1
her	1
meal	1
Neither	1
the	1
wet	1
nurse	1
nor	1
the	1
head	1
nurse	1
were	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
queer	1
French	1
which	1
was	1
their	1
only	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
Hearing	1
Anna	1
s	1
voice	1
a	1
smart	1
tall	1
English	1
nurse	1
with	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
dissolute	1
expression	1
walked	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
hurriedly	1
shaking	1
her	1
fair	1
curls	1
and	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
defend	1
herself	1
though	1
Anna	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
her	1
At	1
every	1
word	1
Anna	1
said	1
the	1
English	1
nurse	1
said	1
hurriedly	1
several	1
times	1
Yes	1
my	1
lady	1
The	1
rosy	1
baby	1
with	1
her	1
black	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
hair	1
her	1
sturdy	1
red	1
little	1
body	1
with	1
tight	1
goose	1
flesh	1
skin	1
delighted	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
stranger	1
She	1
positively	1
envied	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
healthy	1
appearance	1
She	1
was	1
delighted	1
too	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
crawling	1
Not	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children	1
had	1
crawled	1
like	1
that	1
When	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
its	1
little	1
dress	1
tucked	1
up	1
behind	1
it	1
was	1
wonderfully	1
charming	1
Looking	1
round	1
like	1
some	1
little	1
wild	1
animal	1
at	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
big	1
people	1
with	1
her	1
bright	1
black	1
eyes	1
she	1
smiled	1
unmistakably	1
pleased	1
at	1
their	1
admiring	1
her	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
legs	1
sideways	1
she	1
pressed	1
vigorously	1
on	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
rapidly	1
drew	1
her	1
whole	1
back	1
up	1
after	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
another	1
step	1
forward	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
arms	1
But	1
the	1
whole	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
English	1
nurse	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
at	1
all	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
no	1
good	1
nurse	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
so	1
irregular	1
a	1
household	1
as	1
Anna	1
s	1
that	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
could	1
explain	1
to	1
herself	1
how	1
Anna	1
with	1
her	1
insight	1
into	1
people	1
could	1
take	1
such	1
an	1
unprepossessing	1
disreputable	1
looking	1
woman	1
as	1
nurse	1
to	1
her	1
child	1
Besides	1
from	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
dropped	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
saw	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
Anna	1
the	1
two	1
nurses	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
no	1
common	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
s	1
visit	1
was	1
something	1
exceptional	1
Anna	1
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
baby	1
her	1
plaything	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
Most	1
amazing	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
on	1
being	1
asked	1
how	1
many	1
teeth	1
the	1
baby	1
had	1
Anna	1
answered	1
wrong	1
and	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
two	1
last	1
teeth	1
I	1
sometimes	1
feel	1
sorry	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
superfluous	1
here	1
said	1
Anna	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
her	1
skirt	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
plaything	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
with	1
my	1
first	1
child	1
I	1
expected	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
shyly	1
Oh	1
no	1
By	1
the	1
way	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
saw	1
Seryozha	1
said	1
Anna	1
screwing	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
looking	1
at	1
something	1
far	1
away	1
But	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
about	1
that	1
later	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
I	1
m	1
like	1
a	1
hungry	1
beggar	1
woman	1
when	1
a	1
full	1
dinner	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
begin	1
on	1
first	1
The	1
dinner	1
is	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
talks	1
I	1
have	1
before	1
me	1
with	1
you	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
with	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
which	1
subject	1
to	1
begin	1
upon	1
first	1

I	1

everything	1

you	1
Oh	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
sketch	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
you	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
us	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
ll	1
begin	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
opinion	1
and	1
Stiva	1
s	1
about	1
her	1
Stiva	1
says	1
the	1
whole	1
aim	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
is	1
to	1
prove	1
her	1
superiority	1
over	1
Auntie	1
Katerina	1
Pavlovna	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
true	1
but	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
woman	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
a	1
chaperon	1
was	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
for	1
me	1
Then	1
she	1
turned	1
up	1
But	1
really	1
she	1
is	1
good	1
natured	1
She	1
did	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
alleviate	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
my	1
position	1
there	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
she	1
added	1
Here	1
I	1
m	1
perfectly	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
happy	1
Well	1
of	1
that	1
later	1
on	1
though	1
Then	1
Sviazhsky	1
he	1
s	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
Alexey	1
You	1
understand	1
with	1
his	1
property	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Alexey	1
can	1
exercise	1
great	1
influence	1
Then	1
there	1
s	1
Tushkevitch	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
you	1
know	1
Betsy	1
s	1
admirer	1
Now	1
he	1
s	1
been	1
thrown	1
over	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
As	1
Alexey	1
says	1
he	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
very	1
pleasant	1
if	1
one	1
accepts	1
them	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
et	1
puis	1
il	1

as	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
says	1
Then	1
Veslovsky	1
you	1
know	1
him	1
A	1
very	1
nice	1
boy	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
a	1
sly	1
smile	1
curved	1
her	1
lips	1
What	1
s	1
this	1
wild	1
story	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
Levins	1
Veslovsky	1
told	1
Alexey	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
Il	1
est	1
tr`es	1

et	1
na"if	1
she	1
said	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
Men	1
need	1
occupation	1
and	1
Alexey	1
needs	1
a	1
circle	1
so	1
I	1
value	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
We	1
have	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
house	1
lively	1
and	1
gay	1
so	1
that	1
Alexey	1
may	1
not	1
long	1
for	1
any	1
novelty	1
Then	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
the	1
steward	1
a	1
German	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
fellow	1
and	1
he	1
understands	1
his	1
work	1
Alexey	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
Then	1
the	1
doctor	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
Nihilist	1
perhaps	1
but	1
you	1

Dolly	1
for	1
you	1
princess	1
you	1
were	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
said	1
Anna	1
coming	1
out	1
with	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
onto	1
the	1
stone	1
terrace	1
where	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
at	1
an	1

frame	1
working	1
at	1
a	1
cover	1
for	1
Count	1
Alexey	1

She	1
says	1
she	1
doesn	1

want	1
anything	1
before	1
dinner	1

please	1
order	1
some	1
lunch	1
for	1

and	1
I	1

go	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
Alexey	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
gave	1
Dolly	1
a	1
cordial	1
and	1
rather	1
patronizing	1
reception	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
once	1
explaining	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
Anna	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
cared	1
more	1
for	1
her	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
Katerina	1
Pavlovna	1
the	1
aunt	1
that	1
had	1
brought	1
Anna	1
up	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
when	1
everyone	1
had	1
abandoned	1
Anna	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
in	1
this	1
most	1
difficult	1
period	1
of	1
transition	1
Her	1
husband	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
solitude	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
my	1
duty	1
however	1
difficult	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
me	1
not	1
like	1
some	1
other	1
people	1
And	1
how	1
sweet	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
how	1
right	1
of	1
you	1

have	1
come	1
They	1

the	1
river	1
banks	1
Vronsky	1
proposed	1
I	1
agree	1
to	1
anything	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
what	1
Dolly	1
would	1
like	1
best	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
stroll	1
wouldn	1
t	1
you	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
boat	1
perhaps	1
said	1
Anna	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
Tushkevitch	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
bathing	1
place	1
promising	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
boat	1
ready	1
and	1
to	1
wait	1
there	1
for	1
them	1
They	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
in	1
two	1
couples	1
Anna	1
with	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
Dolly	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
Dolly	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
embarrassed	1
and	1
anxious	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
surroundings	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
Abstractly	1
theoretically	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
justify	1
she	1
positively	1
approved	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
conduct	1
As	1
is	1
indeed	1
not	1
unfrequent	1
with	1
women	1
of	1
unimpeachable	1
virtue	1
weary	1
of	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
respectable	1
existence	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
excused	1
illicit	1
love	1
she	1
positively	1
envied	1
it	1
Besides	1
she	1
loved	1
Anna	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
But	1
seeing	1
Anna	1
in	1
actual	1
life	1
among	1
these	1
strangers	1
with	1
this	1
fashionable	1
tone	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
new	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
she	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
What	1
she	1
disliked	1
particularly	1
was	1
seeing	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
ready	1
to	1
overlook	1
everything	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
comforts	1
she	1
enjoyed	1
As	1
a	1
general	1
principle	1
abstractly	1
Dolly	1
approved	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
action	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
man	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
her	1
action	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her	1
Moreover	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
liked	1
Vronsky	1
She	1
thought	1
him	1
very	1
proud	1
and	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
proud	1
except	1
his	1
wealth	1
But	1
against	1
her	1
own	1
will	1
here	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
he	1
overawed	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
him	1
She	1
felt	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
maid	1
about	1
her	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
Just	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
maid	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
not	1
exactly	1
ashamed	1
but	1
embarrassed	1
at	1
her	1
darns	1
so	1
she	1
felt	1
with	1
him	1
not	1
exactly	1
ashamed	1
but	1
embarrassed	1
at	1
herself	1
Dolly	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
conversation	1
Even	1
though	1
she	1
supposed	1
that	1
through	1
his	1
pride	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
tell	1
him	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
liked	1
his	1
house	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
building	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
fashioned	1
style	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
like	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
steps	1
Was	1
that	1
always	1
so	1
Oh	1
no	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
beamed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
court	1
last	1
spring	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
diffidently	1
but	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
draw	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
having	1
devoted	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble	1
to	1
improve	1
and	1
beautify	1
his	1
home	1
Vronsky	1
felt	1
a	1
need	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
the	1
improvements	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
person	1
and	1
was	1
genuinely	1
delighted	1
at	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
praise	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hospital	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
tired	1
indeed	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
far	1
Shall	1
we	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
convince	1
himself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
bored	1
Are	1
you	1
coming	1
Anna	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
We	1
will	1
come	1
won	1
t	1
we	1
she	1
said	1
addressing	1
Sviazhsky	1
Mais	1
il	1
ne	1
faut	1
pas	1
laisser	1
le	1
pauvre	1
Veslovsky	1
et	1
Tushkevitch	1

	1
We	1
must	1
send	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
Yes	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
monument	1
he	1
is	1
setting	1
up	1
here	1
said	1
Anna	1
turning	1
to	1
Dolly	1
with	1
that	1
sly	1
smile	1
of	1
comprehension	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
previously	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
hospital	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
real	1
importance	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
But	1
to	1
show	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
trying	1
to	1
ingratiate	1
himself	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
promptly	1
added	1
some	1
slightly	1
critical	1
remarks	1
I	1
wonder	1
though	1
count	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
while	1
you	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
you	1
take	1
so	1
little	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
schools	1
C	1
est	1
devenu	1
tellement	1
commun	1
les	1
'ecoles	1
	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
You	1
understand	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
but	1
it	1
just	1
happens	1
so	1
my	1
interest	1
has	1
been	1
diverted	1
elsewhere	1
This	1
way	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
hospital	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
turning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
The	1
ladies	1
put	1
up	1
their	1
parasols	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
side	1
path	1
After	1
going	1
down	1
several	1
turnings	1
and	1
going	1
through	1
a	1
little	1
gate	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
saw	1
standing	1
on	1
rising	1
ground	1
before	1
her	1
a	1
large	1
pretentious	1
looking	1
red	1
building	1
almost	1
finished	1
The	1
iron	1
roof	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
painted	1
shone	1
with	1
dazzling	1
brightness	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
Beside	1
the	1
finished	1
building	1
another	1
had	1
been	1
begun	1
surrounded	1
by	1
scaffolding	1
Workmen	1
in	1
aprons	1
standing	1
on	1
scaffolds	1
were	1
laying	1
bricks	1
pouring	1
mortar	1
out	1
of	1
vats	1
and	1
smoothing	1
it	1
with	1
trowels	1
How	1
quickly	1
work	1
gets	1
done	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
here	1
last	1
time	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
By	1
the	1
autumn	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
ready	1
Inside	1
almost	1
everything	1
is	1
done	1
said	1
Anna	1
And	1
what	1
s	1
this	1
new	1
building	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
dispensary	1
answered	1
Vronsky	1
seeing	1
the	1
architect	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
coming	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
excusing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
Going	1
round	1
a	1
hole	1
where	1
the	1
workmen	1
were	1
slaking	1
lime	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
architect	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
rather	1
warmly	1
The	1
front	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
low	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Anna	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
foundation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
said	1
Anna	1
Yes	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
better	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
said	1
the	1
architect	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
late	1
Yes	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
Anna	1
answered	1
Sviazhsky	1
who	1
was	1
expressing	1
his	1
surprise	1
at	1
her	1
knowledge	1
of	1
architecture	1
This	1
new	1
building	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
the	1
hospital	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
afterthought	1
and	1
was	1
begun	1
without	1
a	1
plan	1
Vronsky	1
having	1
finished	1
his	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
architect	1
joined	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
led	1
them	1
inside	1
the	1
hospital	1
Although	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
cornices	1
outside	1
and	1
were	1
painting	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor	1
upstairs	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
were	1
finished	1
Going	1
up	1
the	1
broad	1
cast	1
iron	1
staircase	1
to	1
the	1
landing	1
they	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
large	1
room	1
The	1
walls	1
were	1
stuccoed	1
to	1
look	1
like	1
marble	1
the	1
huge	1
plate	1
glass	1
windows	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
only	1
the	1
parquet	1
floor	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
finished	1
and	1
the	1
carpenters	1
who	1
were	1
planing	1
a	1
block	1
of	1
it	1
left	1
their	1
work	1
taking	1
off	1
the	1
bands	1
that	1
fastened	1
their	1
hair	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
gentry	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Here	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
desk	1
tables	1
and	1
benches	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
This	1
way	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
in	1
here	1
Don	1
t	1
go	1
near	1
the	1
window	1
said	1
Anna	1
trying	1
the	1
paint	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
dry	1
Alexey	1
the	1
paint	1
s	1
dry	1
already	1
she	1
added	1
From	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
Here	1
Vronsky	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
mechanism	1
for	1
ventilation	1
on	1
a	1
novel	1
system	1
Then	1
he	1
showed	1
them	1
marble	1
baths	1
and	1
beds	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
springs	1
Then	1
he	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
wards	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
storeroom	1
the	1
linen	1
room	1
then	1
the	1
heating	1
stove	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
pattern	1
then	1
the	1
trolleys	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
no	1
noise	1
as	1
they	1
carried	1
everything	1
needed	1
along	1
the	1
corridors	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
Sviazhsky	1
as	1
a	1
connoisseur	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
mechanical	1
improvements	1
appreciated	1
everything	1
fully	1
Dolly	1
simply	1
wondered	1
at	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
before	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
made	1
minute	1
inquiries	1
about	1
everything	1
which	1
gave	1
Vronsky	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
Yes	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
solitary	1
example	1
of	1
a	1
properly	1
fitted	1
hospital	1
in	1
Russia	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
And	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
lying	1
in	1
ward	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
That	1
s	1
so	1
much	1
needed	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
courtesy	1
Vronsky	1
interrupted	1
her	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
lying	1
in	1
home	1
but	1
a	1
hospital	1
for	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
is	1
intended	1
for	1
all	1
diseases	1
except	1
infectious	1
complaints	1
he	1
said	1
Ah	1
look	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
he	1
rolled	1
up	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
an	1
invalid	1
chair	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
ordered	1
for	1
the	1
convalescents	1
Look	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
chair	1
and	1
began	1
moving	1
it	1
The	1
patient	1
can	1
t	1
walk	1
still	1
too	1
weak	1
perhaps	1
or	1
something	1
wrong	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
air	1
and	1
he	1
moves	1
rolls	1
himself	1
along	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
interested	1
by	1
everything	1
She	1
liked	1
everything	1
very	1
much	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
liked	1
Vronsky	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
natural	1
simple	1
hearted	1
eagerness	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
good	1
man	1
she	1
thought	1
several	1
times	1
not	1
hearing	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
penetrating	1
into	1
his	1
expression	1
while	1
she	1
mentally	1
put	1
herself	1
in	1
Anna	1
s	1
place	1
She	1
liked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
just	1
now	1
with	1
his	1
eager	1
interest	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
Anna	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
Chapter	1
21	1
No	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
princess	1
is	1
tired	1
and	1
horses	1
don	1
t	1
interest	1
her	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
to	1
Anna	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
stables	1
where	1
Sviazhsky	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
new	1
stallion	1
You	1
go	1
on	1
while	1
I	1
escort	1
the	1
princess	1
home	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
talk	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
that	1
he	1
added	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
horses	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
answered	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
rather	1
astonished	1
She	1
saw	1
by	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
something	1
from	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
little	1
gate	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
Anna	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
having	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
neither	1
hear	1
nor	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
began	1
You	1
guess	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
wrong	1
in	1
believing	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
wiped	1
his	1
head	1
which	1
was	1
growing	1
bald	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
merely	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
dismay	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
afraid	1
his	1
laughing	1
eyes	1
and	1
stern	1
expression	1
scared	1
her	1
The	1
most	1
diverse	1
suppositions	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
to	1
her	1
flashed	1
into	1
her	1
brain	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
beg	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
refuse	1
or	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
set	1
that	1
will	1
receive	1
Anna	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Or	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Anna	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
about	1
Kitty	1
that	1
he	1
feels	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
All	1
her	1
conjectures	1
were	1
unpleasant	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
to	1
her	1
You	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
influence	1
with	1
Anna	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
do	1
help	1
me	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
looked	1
with	1
timid	1
inquiry	1
into	1
his	1
energetic	1
face	1
which	1
under	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
was	1
continually	1
being	1
lighted	1
up	1
in	1
patches	1
by	1
the	1
sunshine	1
and	1
then	1
passing	1
into	1
complete	1
shadow	1
again	1
She	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
but	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
silence	1
beside	1
her	1
scratching	1
with	1
his	1
cane	1
in	1
the	1
gravel	1
You	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
you	1
the	1
only	1
woman	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
former	1
friends	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
count	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
not	1
because	1
you	1
regard	1
our	1
position	1
as	1
normal	1
but	1
because	1
understanding	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
you	1
still	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
her	1
Have	1
I	1
understood	1
you	1
rightly	1
he	1
asked	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
her	1
Oh	1
yes	1
answered	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
putting	1
down	1
her	1
sunshade	1
but	1
No	1
he	1
broke	1
in	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
oblivious	1
of	1
the	1
awkward	1
position	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
his	1
companion	1
he	1
stopped	1
abruptly	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
stop	1
short	1
too	1
No	1
one	1
feels	1
more	1
deeply	1
and	1
intensely	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
Anna	1
s	1
position	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
well	1
understand	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
supposing	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
heart	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
that	1
position	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
I	1
understand	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
involuntarily	1
admiring	1
the	1
sincerity	1
and	1
firmness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
But	1
just	1
because	1
you	1
feel	1
yourself	1
responsible	1
you	1
exaggerate	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
she	1
said	1
Her	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
difficult	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
understand	1
In	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
is	1
hell	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
quickly	1
frowning	1
darkly	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
moral	1
sufferings	1
greater	1
than	1
what	1
she	1
went	1
through	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
in	1
that	1
fortnight	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
Yes	1
but	1
here	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
neither	1
Anna	1
nor	1
you	1
miss	1
society	1
Society	1
he	1
said	1
contemptuously	1
how	1
could	1
I	1
miss	1
society	1
So	1
far	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
always	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
and	1
at	1
peace	1
I	1
see	1
in	1
Anna	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
perfectly	1
happy	1
she	1
has	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
already	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
smiling	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
a	1
doubt	1
entered	1
her	1
mind	1
whether	1
Anna	1
really	1
were	1
happy	1
But	1
Vronsky	1
it	1
appeared	1
had	1
no	1
doubts	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
Yes	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
revived	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
sufferings	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
She	1
is	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
But	1
I	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
before	1
us	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
Well	1
then	1
let	1
us	1
sit	1
here	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
garden	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
He	1
stood	1
up	1
facing	1
her	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
happy	1
he	1
repeated	1
and	1
the	1
doubt	1
whether	1
she	1
were	1
happy	1
sank	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
mind	1
But	1
can	1
it	1
last	1
Whether	1
we	1
have	1
acted	1
rightly	1
or	1
wrongly	1
is	1
another	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
die	1
is	1
cast	1
he	1
said	1
passing	1
from	1
Russian	1
to	1
French	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
together	1
for	1
life	1
We	1
are	1
united	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
ties	1
of	1
love	1
that	1
we	1
hold	1
most	1
sacred	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
child	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
other	1
children	1
But	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
our	1
position	1
are	1
such	1
that	1
thousands	1
of	1
complications	1
arise	1
which	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
And	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
well	1
understand	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
seeing	1
them	1
My	1
daughter	1
is	1
by	1
law	1
not	1
my	1
daughter	1
but	1
Karenin	1
s	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
this	1
falsity	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
vigorous	1
gesture	1
of	1
refusal	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
with	1
gloomy	1
inquiry	1
towards	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
simply	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
One	1
day	1
a	1
son	1
may	1
be	1
born	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
legally	1
a	1
Karenin	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
my	1
name	1
nor	1
of	1
my	1
property	1
and	1
however	1
happy	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
our	1
home	1
life	1
and	1
however	1
many	1
children	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
real	1
tie	1
between	1
us	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
Karenins	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
the	1
bitterness	1
and	1
horror	1
of	1
this	1
position	1
I	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
this	1
to	1
Anna	1
It	1
irritates	1
her	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak	1
plainly	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
Now	1
look	1
at	1
another	1
side	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
love	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
occupation	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
occupation	1
and	1
am	1
proud	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
and	1
consider	1
it	1
nobler	1
than	1
the	1
pursuits	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
companions	1
at	1
court	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
And	1
most	1
certainly	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
change	1
the	1
work	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
for	1
theirs	1
I	1
am	1
working	1
here	1
settled	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
place	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
and	1
contented	1
and	1
we	1
need	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
happy	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
work	1
here	1
Ce	1
n	1

	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
noticed	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
in	1
his	1
explanation	1
he	1
grew	1
confused	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
this	1
digression	1
but	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
having	1
once	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
matters	1
near	1
his	1
heart	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Anna	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
making	1
a	1
clean	1
breast	1
of	1
everything	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
category	1
of	1
matters	1
near	1
his	1
heart	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Anna	1
Well	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
collecting	1
himself	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
work	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
will	1
not	1
die	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
heirs	1
to	1
come	1
after	1
me	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
Conceive	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
knows	1
that	1
his	1
children	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
loves	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
his	1
but	1
will	1
belong	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
hates	1
them	1
and	1
cares	1
nothing	1
about	1
them	1
It	1
is	1
awful	1
He	1
paused	1
evidently	1
much	1
moved	1
Yes	1
indeed	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
But	1
what	1
can	1
Anna	1
do	1
queried	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Yes	1
that	1
brings	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
conversation	1
he	1
said	1
calming	1
himself	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
Anna	1
can	1
it	1
depends	1
on	1
her	1
Even	1
to	1
petition	1
the	1
Tsar	1
for	1
legitimization	1
a	1
divorce	1
is	1
essential	1
And	1
that	1
depends	1
on	1
Anna	1
Her	1
husband	1
agreed	1
to	1
a	1
divorce	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
your	1
husband	1
had	1
arranged	1
it	1
completely	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
it	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
said	1
plainly	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
expressed	1
the	1
desire	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
said	1
gloomily	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
Pharisaical	1
cruelties	1
of	1
which	1
only	1
such	1
heartless	1
men	1
are	1
capable	1
He	1
knows	1
what	1
agony	1
any	1
recollection	1
of	1
him	1
must	1
give	1
her	1
and	1
knowing	1
her	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
her	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
agony	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
importance	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
passer	1
par	1
dessus	1
toutes	1
ces	1
finesses	1
de	1
sentiment	1
Il	1
y	1
va	1
du	1
bonheur	1
et	1
de	1
l	1
existence	1
d	1
Anne	1
et	1
de	1
ses	1
enfants	1
	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
myself	1
though	1
it	1
s	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
very	1
hard	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
threatening	1
someone	1
for	1
its	1
being	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
princess	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
shamelessly	1
clutching	1
at	1
you	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
of	1
salvation	1
Help	1
me	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
a	1
divorce	1
Yes	1
of	1
course	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
said	1
dreamily	1
as	1
she	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
her	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Yes	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
repeated	1
with	1
decision	1
thinking	1
of	1
Anna	1
Use	1
your	1
influence	1
with	1
her	1
make	1
her	1
write	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
I	1
m	1
almost	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
Very	1
well	1
I	1
will	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
herself	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
she	1
suddenly	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
recalled	1
Anna	1
s	1
strange	1
new	1
habit	1
of	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
And	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
Anna	1
drooped	1
her	1
eyelids	1
just	1
when	1
the	1
deeper	1
questions	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
touched	1
upon	1
Just	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
half	1
shut	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
life	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
everything	1
thought	1
Dolly	1
Yes	1
indeed	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake	1
and	1
for	1
hers	1
I	1
will	1
talk	1
to	1
her	1
Dolly	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
look	1
of	1
gratitude	1
They	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
Chapter	1
22	1
When	1
Anna	1
found	1
Dolly	1
at	1
home	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
looked	1
intently	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
though	1
questioning	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
talk	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
inquiry	1
in	1
words	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
dinner	1
time	1
she	1
said	1
We	1
ve	1
not	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
at	1
all	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
reckoning	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
Now	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
dress	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
do	1
too	1
we	1
all	1
got	1
splashed	1
at	1
the	1
buildings	1
Dolly	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
amused	1
To	1
change	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
best	1
dress	1
But	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
signify	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
her	1
preparation	1
for	1
dinner	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
maid	1
to	1
brush	1
her	1
dress	1
changed	1
her	1
cuffs	1
and	1
tie	1
and	1
put	1
some	1
lace	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
This	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
Anna	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
third	1
dress	1
again	1
of	1
extreme	1
simplicity	1
Yes	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
formal	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
apologizing	1
for	1
her	1
magnificence	1
Alexey	1
is	1
delighted	1
at	1
your	1
visit	1
as	1
he	1
rarely	1
is	1
at	1
anything	1
He	1
has	1
completely	1
lost	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
tired	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
talking	1
about	1
anything	1
before	1
dinner	1
Going	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
found	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
already	1
there	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
black	1
frock	1
coats	1
The	1
architect	1
wore	1
a	1
swallow	1
tail	1
coat	1
Vronsky	1
presented	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
to	1
his	1
guest	1
The	1
architect	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
introduced	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
hospital	1
A	1
stout	1
butler	1
resplendent	1
with	1
a	1
smoothly	1
shaven	1
round	1
chin	1
and	1
a	1
starched	1
white	1
cravat	1
announced	1
that	1
dinner	1
was	1
ready	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
got	1
up	1
Vronsky	1
asked	1
Sviazhsky	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
and	1
himself	1
offered	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
Dolly	1
Veslovsky	1
was	1
before	1
Tushkevitch	1
in	1
offering	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
so	1
that	1
Tushkevitch	1
with	1
the	1
steward	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
walked	1
in	1
alone	1
The	1
dinner	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
waiting	1
at	1
table	1
the	1
wine	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
were	1
not	1
simply	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
tone	1
of	1
modern	1
luxury	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
seemed	1
even	1
more	1
sumptuous	1
and	1
modern	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
watched	1
this	1
luxury	1
which	1
was	1
novel	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
housekeeper	1
used	1
to	1
managing	1
a	1
household	1
although	1
she	1
never	1
dreamed	1
of	1
adapting	1
anything	1
she	1
saw	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
household	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
of	1
luxury	1
far	1
above	1
her	1
own	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
scrutinizing	1
every	1
detail	1
and	1
wondering	1
how	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
even	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
people	1
she	1
knew	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
considered	1
this	1
question	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
readily	1
believed	1
what	1
every	1
well	1
bred	1
host	1
tries	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
guests	1
feel	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
well	1
ordered	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
has	1
cost	1
him	1
the	1
host	1
no	1
trouble	1
whatever	1
but	1
comes	1
of	1
itself	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
even	1
porridge	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
breakfast	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
of	1
itself	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
where	1
so	1
complicated	1
and	1
magnificent	1
a	1
style	1
of	1
luxury	1
was	1
maintained	1
someone	1
must	1
give	1
earnest	1
attention	1
to	1
its	1
organization	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
glance	1
with	1
which	1
Alexey	1
Kirillovitch	1
scanned	1
the	1
table	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
nodded	1
to	1
the	1
butler	1
and	1
offered	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
her	1
choice	1
between	1
cold	1
soup	1
and	1
hot	1
soup	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
organized	1
and	1
maintained	1
by	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
himself	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
all	1
rested	1
no	1
more	1
upon	1
Anna	1
than	1
upon	1
Veslovsky	1
She	1
Sviazhsky	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
were	1
equally	1
guests	1
with	1
light	1
hearts	1
enjoying	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
for	1
them	1
Anna	1
was	1
the	1
hostess	1
only	1
in	1
conducting	1
the	1
conversation	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
a	1
difficult	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table	1
with	1
persons	1
present	1
like	1
the	1
steward	1
and	1
the	1
architect	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
completely	1
different	1
world	1
struggling	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overawed	1
by	1
an	1
elegance	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
unaccustomed	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
sustain	1
a	1
large	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
But	1
this	1
difficult	1
conversation	1
Anna	1
directed	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
tact	1
and	1
naturalness	1
and	1
indeed	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
actual	1
enjoyment	1
as	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
observed	1
The	1
conversation	1
began	1
about	1
the	1
row	1
Tushkevitch	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
had	1
taken	1
alone	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
Tushkevitch	1
began	1
describing	1
the	1
last	1
boat	1
races	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
the	1
Yacht	1
Club	1
But	1
Anna	1
seizing	1
the	1
first	1
pause	1
at	1
once	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
architect	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
silence	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanitch	1
was	1
struck	1
she	1
said	1
meaning	1
Sviazhsky	1
at	1
the	1
progress	1
the	1
new	1
building	1
had	1
made	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
last	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
there	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
grows	1
It	1
s	1
first	1
rate	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
excellency	1
said	1
the	1
architect	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
was	1
respectful	1
and	1
composed	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
matter	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
district	1
authorities	1
Where	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
write	1
out	1
sheaves	1
of	1
papers	1
here	1
I	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
words	1
we	1
settle	1
the	1
business	1
The	1
American	1
way	1
of	1
doing	1
business	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Yes	1
there	1
they	1
build	1
in	1
a	1
rational	1
fashion	1
The	1
conversation	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
misuse	1
of	1
political	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
but	1
Anna	1
quickly	1
brought	1
it	1
round	1
to	1
another	1
topic	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
steward	1
into	1
talk	1
Have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
a	1
reaping	1
machine	1
she	1
said	1
addressing	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
We	1
had	1
just	1
ridden	1
over	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
one	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
one	1
How	1
do	1
they	1
work	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
Exactly	1
like	1
little	1
scissors	1
A	1
plank	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
little	1
scissors	1
Like	1
this	1
Anna	1
took	1
a	1
knife	1
and	1
fork	1
in	1
her	1
beautiful	1
white	1
hands	1
covered	1
with	1
rings	1
and	1
began	1
showing	1
how	1
the	1
machine	1
worked	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
understood	1
from	1
her	1
explanation	1
but	1
aware	1
that	1
her	1
talk	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
beautiful	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
explaining	1
More	1
like	1
little	1
penknives	1
Veslovsky	1
said	1
playfully	1
never	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
Anna	1
gave	1
a	1
just	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
but	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
true	1
Karl	1
Fedoritch	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
like	1
little	1
scissors	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
Oh	1
ja	1
	1
answered	1
the	1
German	1
	1
Es	1
ist	1
ein	1
ganz	1
einfaches	1
Ding	1
	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
bind	1
too	1
I	1
saw	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
Vienna	1
exhibition	1
which	1
binds	1
with	1
a	1
wire	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
They	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
profitable	1
in	1
use	1
	1
Es	1
kommt	1
drauf	1
an	1
Der	1
Preis	1
vom	1
Draht	1
muss	1
ausgerechnet	1
werden	1
	1
And	1
the	1
German	1
roused	1
from	1
his	1
taciturnity	1
turned	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
	1
Das	1
l"asst	1
sich	1
ausrechnen	1
Erlaucht	1
	1
The	1
German	1
was	1
just	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
pocket	1
where	1
were	1
his	1
pencil	1
and	1
the	1
notebook	1
he	1
always	1
wrote	1
in	1
but	1
recollecting	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
dinner	1
and	1
observing	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
chilly	1
glance	1
he	1
checked	1
himself	1
	1
Zu	1

	1
he	1
concluded	1
	1
W"unscht	1

so	1

	1
said	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
mimicking	1
the	1
German	1
	1
J	1
adore	1
l	1

	1
he	1
addressed	1
Anna	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
	1
Cessez	1
	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
playful	1
severity	1
We	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
Vassily	1
Semyonitch	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
a	1
sickly	1
looking	1
man	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
there	1
I	1
went	1
there	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
flight	1
the	1
doctor	1
answered	1
with	1
gloomy	1
jocoseness	1
Then	1
you	1
ve	1
taken	1
a	1
good	1
constitutional	1
Splendid	1
Well	1
and	1
how	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
typhus	1
Typhus	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
taking	1
a	1
bad	1
turn	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
said	1
Anna	1
and	1
having	1
thus	1
paid	1
the	1
dues	1
of	1
civility	1
to	1
her	1
domestic	1
circle	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
friends	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
hard	1
task	1
though	1
to	1
construct	1
a	1
machine	1
from	1
your	1
description	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
Sviazhsky	1
said	1
jestingly	1
Oh	1
no	1
why	1
so	1
said	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
betrayed	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
charming	1
in	1
her	1
disquisitions	1
upon	1
the	1
machine	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
noticed	1
by	1
Sviazhsky	1
This	1
new	1
trait	1
of	1
girlish	1
coquettishness	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
on	1
Dolly	1
But	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
s	1
knowledge	1
of	1
architecture	1
is	1
marvelous	1
said	1
Tushkevitch	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
heard	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
talking	1
yesterday	1
about	1
plinths	1
and	1
damp	1
courses	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
Have	1
I	1
got	1
it	1
right	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
marvelous	1
about	1
it	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
and	1
hears	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
Anna	1
But	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
houses	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
saw	1
that	1
Anna	1
disliked	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
raillery	1
that	1
existed	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
Veslovsky	1
but	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
it	1
against	1
her	1
will	1
Vronsky	1
acted	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
quite	1
differently	1
from	1
Levin	1
He	1
obviously	1
attached	1
no	1
significance	1
to	1
Veslovsky	1
s	1
chattering	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
encouraged	1
his	1
jests	1
Come	1
now	1
tell	1
us	1
Veslovsky	1
how	1
are	1
the	1
stones	1
held	1
together	1
By	1
cement	1
of	1
course	1
Bravo	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
cement	1
Oh	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
paste	1
no	1
putty	1
said	1
Veslovsky	1
raising	1
a	1
general	1
laugh	1
The	1
company	1
at	1
dinner	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
the	1
architect	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
who	1
remained	1
plunged	1
in	1
gloomy	1
silence	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
never	1
paused	1
glancing	1
off	1
one	1
subject	1
fastening	1
on	1
another	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
stinging	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
Once	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
felt	1
wounded	1
to	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
got	1
so	1
hot	1
that	1
she	1
positively	1
flushed	1
and	1
wondered	1
afterwards	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
anything	1
extreme	1
or	1
unpleasant	1
Sviazhsky	1
began	1
talking	1
of	1
Levin	1
describing	1
his	1
strange	1
view	1
that	1
machinery	1
is	1
simply	1
pernicious	1
in	1
its	1
effects	1
on	1
Russian	1
agriculture	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
knowing	1
this	1
M	1
Levin	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
smiling	1
but	1
most	1
likely	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
machines	1
he	1
condemns	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
seen	1
and	1
tried	1
any	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
after	1
a	1
queer	1
fashion	1
some	1
Russian	1
imitation	1
not	1
a	1
machine	1
from	1
abroad	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
views	1
can	1
anyone	1
have	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
Turkish	1
views	1
in	1
general	1
Veslovsky	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
defend	1
his	1
opinions	1
Darya	1

up	1

I	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
highly	1
cultivated	1
man	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
here	1
he	1
would	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
you	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
capable	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
I	1
like	1
him	1
extremely	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
great	1
friends	1

that	1
district	1

and	1
arbitration	1
boards	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
no	1

no	1

of	1

upon	1
us	1
and	1
so	1
we	1

to	1

these	1

no	1

more	1
strict	1
in	1
the	1

by	1

of	1
superiority	1
For	1
my	1
part	1
pursued	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
or	1
other	1
keenly	1
affected	1
by	1
this	1
conversation	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
extremely	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
honor	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
thanks	1
to	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanitch	1
he	1
indicated	1
Sviazhsky	1
in	1
electing	1
me	1
a	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
I	1
consider	1
that	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
session	1
of	1
judging	1
some	1
peasants	1
quarrel	1
about	1
a	1
horse	1
is	1
as	1
important	1
as	1
anything	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
And	1
I	1
shall	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
honor	1
if	1
they	1
elect	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
It	1
s	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
I	1
can	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
advantages	1
I	1
enjoy	1
as	1
a	1
landowner	1
Unluckily	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
the	1
weight	1
that	1
the	1
big	1
landowners	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
It	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
serenely	1
confident	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
being	1
right	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
table	1
She	1
thought	1
how	1
Levin	1
who	1
believed	1
the	1
opposite	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
positive	1
in	1
his	1
opinions	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
table	1
But	1
she	1
loved	1
Levin	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
So	1
we	1
can	1
reckon	1
upon	1
you	1
count	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
elections	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
a	1
little	1
beforehand	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
by	1
the	1
eighth	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
stop	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
rather	1
agree	1
with	1
your	1
beau	1
fr`ere	1
said	1
Anna	1
though	1
not	1
quite	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
ground	1
as	1
he	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
public	1
duties	1
in	1
these	1
latter	1
days	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
government	1
functionaries	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
a	1
functionary	1
for	1
every	1
single	1
thing	1
so	1
now	1
everyone	1
s	1
doing	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
public	1
duty	1
Alexey	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
now	1
six	1
months	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
member	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
of	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
different	1
public	1
bodies	1
Du	1
train	1
que	1
cela	1
va	1
	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
will	1
be	1
wasted	1
on	1
it	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
these	1
bodies	1
they	1
ll	1
end	1
in	1
being	1
a	1
mere	1
form	1
How	1
many	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanitch	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
over	1
twenty	1
I	1
fancy	1
Anna	1
spoke	1
lightly	1
but	1
irritation	1
could	1
be	1
discerned	1
in	1
her	1
tone	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
watching	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
attentively	1
detected	1
it	1
instantly	1
She	1
noticed	1
too	1
that	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
had	1
immediately	1
taken	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
obstinate	1
expression	1
Noticing	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
remembering	1
what	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
without	1
apparent	1
connection	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Dolly	1
surmised	1
that	1
this	1
question	1
of	1
public	1
activity	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
some	1
deep	1
private	1
disagreement	1
between	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
The	1
dinner	1
the	1
wine	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
were	1
all	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
like	1
what	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
formal	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
had	1
become	1
quite	1
unfamiliar	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
all	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
impersonal	1
and	1
constrained	1
character	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
an	1
ordinary	1
day	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
circle	1
of	1
friends	1
it	1
made	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
her	1
After	1
dinner	1
they	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
then	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
play	1
lawn	1
tennis	1
The	1
players	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
parties	1
stood	1
on	1
opposite	1
sides	1
of	1
a	1
tightly	1
drawn	1
net	1
with	1
gilt	1
poles	1
on	1
the	1
carefully	1
leveled	1
and	1
rolled	1
croquet	1
ground	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
made	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
play	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
understand	1
the	1
game	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
did	1
understand	1
it	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
and	1
simply	1
looked	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
players	1
Her	1
partner	1
Tushkevitch	1
gave	1
up	1
playing	1
too	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
kept	1
the	1
game	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
both	1
played	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
seriously	1
They	1
kept	1
a	1
sharp	1
lookout	1
on	1
the	1
balls	1
served	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
without	1
haste	1
or	1
getting	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
way	1
they	1
ran	1
adroitly	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
rebound	1
and	1
neatly	1
and	1
accurately	1
returned	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
net	1
Veslovsky	1
played	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
eager	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
players	1
lively	1
with	1
his	1
high	1
spirits	1
His	1
laughter	1
and	1
outcries	1
never	1
paused	1
Like	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
permission	1
he	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
his	1
solid	1
comely	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
with	1
his	1
red	1
perspiring	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
impulsive	1
movements	1
made	1
a	1
picture	1
that	1
imprinted	1
itself	1
vividly	1
on	1
the	1
memory	1
When	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
that	1
night	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
she	1
saw	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
flying	1
about	1
the	1
croquet	1
ground	1
During	1
the	1
game	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
not	1
enjoying	1
herself	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
light	1
tone	1
of	1
raillery	1
that	1
was	1
kept	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
Vassenka	1
Veslovsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
and	1
the	1
unnaturalness	1
altogether	1
of	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
all	1
alone	1
without	1
children	1
playing	1
at	1
a	1
child	1
s	1
game	1
But	1
to	1
avoid	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
party	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
time	1
somehow	1
after	1
a	1
rest	1
she	1
joined	1
the	1
game	1
again	1
and	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
enjoying	1
it	1
All	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
acting	1
in	1
a	1
theater	1
with	1
actors	1
cleverer	1
than	1
she	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
bad	1
acting	1
was	1
spoiling	1
the	1
whole	1
performance	1
She	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
staying	1
two	1
days	1
if	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
during	1
the	1
game	1
she	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
home	1
next	1
day	1
The	1
maternal	1
cares	1
and	1
worries	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
hated	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
now	1
after	1
a	1
day	1
spent	1
without	1
them	1
struck	1
her	1
in	1
quite	1
another	1
light	1
and	1
tempted	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
When	1
after	1
evening	1
tea	1
and	1
a	1
row	1
by	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
went	1
alone	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
began	1
arranging	1
her	1
thin	1
hair	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
It	1
was	1
positively	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
immediately	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
Chapter	1
23	1
Dolly	1
was	1
wanting	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
when	1
Anna	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
attired	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
Anna	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
begun	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
matters	1
near	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
every	1
time	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
stopped	1
Afterwards	1
by	1
ourselves	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
about	1
everything	1
I	1
ve	1
got	1
so	1
much	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
Now	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
themselves	1
and	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
She	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolly	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
all	1
the	1
stores	1
of	1
intimate	1
talk	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
inexhaustible	1
beforehand	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
nothing	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
already	1
Well	1
what	1
of	1
Kitty	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
looking	1
penitently	1
at	1
Dolly	1
Tell	1
me	1
the	1
truth	1
Dolly	1
isn	1
t	1
she	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
Angry	1
Oh	1
no	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
smiling	1
But	1
she	1
hates	1
me	1
despises	1
me	1
Oh	1
no	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
isn	1
t	1
forgiven	1
Yes	1
yes	1
said	1
Anna	1
turning	1
away	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
blame	1
What	1
s	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
being	1
to	1
blame	1
Could	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
Could	1
it	1
possibly	1
have	1
happened	1
that	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
become	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Stiva	1
Really	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
Yes	1
yes	1
but	1
we	1
ve	1
not	1
finished	1
about	1
Kitty	1
Is	1
she	1
happy	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
nice	1
man	1
they	1
say	1
He	1
s	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
very	1
nice	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
a	1
better	1
man	1
Ah	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
glad	1
Much	1
more	1
than	1
very	1
nice	1
she	1
repeated	1
Dolly	1
smiled	1
But	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
yourself	1
We	1
ve	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
And	1
I	1
ve	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
Dolly	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
She	1
felt	1
it	1
awkward	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
either	1
the	1
count	1
or	1
Alexey	1
Kirillovitch	1
With	1
Alexey	1
said	1
Anna	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
talked	1
about	1
But	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
directly	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
say	1
like	1
that	1
straight	1
off	1
I	1
really	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
No	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
You	1
see	1
my	1
life	1
But	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
forget	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
seeing	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
alone	1
But	1
we	1
came	1
here	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
lived	1
quite	1
alone	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
alone	1
again	1
and	1
I	1
desire	1
nothing	1
better	1
But	1
imagine	1
me	1
living	1
alone	1
without	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
I	1
see	1
by	1
everything	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
often	1
be	1
repeated	1
that	1
he	1
will	1

she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
close	1
by	1
Dolly	1
Of	1
course	1
she	1
interrupted	1
Dolly	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
try	1
to	1

him	1
by	1
force	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
keep	1
him	1
indeed	1
The	1
races	1
are	1
just	1
coming	1
his	1
horses	1
are	1
running	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
But	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
fancy	1
my	1
position	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
it	1
She	1
smiled	1
Well	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
talk	1
about	1
with	1
you	1
He	1
spoke	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
easy	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
advocate	1
of	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
possibility	1
whether	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
hesitated	1
correct	1
improve	1
your	1
position	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
if	1
possible	1
you	1
should	1
get	1
married	1
Divorce	1
you	1
mean	1
said	1
Anna	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
only	1
woman	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
Betsy	1
Tverskaya	1
You	1
know	1
her	1
of	1

Au	1

	1
She	1
had	1
an	1
intrigue	1
with	1
Tushkevitch	1
deceiving	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
basest	1
way	1
And	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
position	1
was	1
irregular	1
Don	1
t	1
imagine	1
I	1
would	1
compare	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
darling	1
But	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
remembering	1
Well	1
so	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
repeated	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unhappy	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
egoism	1
but	1
what	1
a	1
legitimate	1
and	1
noble	1
egoism	1
He	1
wants	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
legitimize	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
husband	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
legal	1
right	1
to	1
you	1
What	1
wife	1
what	1
slave	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
utterly	1
a	1
slave	1
as	1
I	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
she	1
put	1
in	1
gloomily	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
he	1
desires	1
he	1
desires	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
suffer	1
That	1
s	1
impossible	1
Well	1
Well	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
legitimate	1
desire	1
he	1
wishes	1
that	1
your	1
children	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
name	1
What	1
children	1
Anna	1
said	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolly	1
and	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
Annie	1
and	1
those	1
to	1
come	1
He	1
need	1
not	1
trouble	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
children	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
that	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
because	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
wish	1
it	1
And	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
emotion	1
Anna	1
smiled	1
as	1
she	1
caught	1
the	1
na"ive	1
expression	1
of	1
curiosity	1
wonder	1
and	1
horror	1
on	1
Dolly	1
s	1
face	1
The	1
doctor	1
told	1
me	1
after	1
my	1
illness	1
Impossible	1
said	1
Dolly	1
opening	1
her	1
eyes	1
wide	1
For	1
her	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
discoveries	1
the	1
consequences	1
and	1
deductions	1
from	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
immense	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
one	1
feels	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
instant	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
reflect	1
a	1
great	1
great	1
deal	1
upon	1
it	1
This	1
discovery	1
suddenly	1
throwing	1
light	1
on	1
all	1
those	1
families	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
children	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
so	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
her	1
aroused	1
so	1
many	1
ideas	1
reflections	1
and	1
contradictory	1
emotions	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
simply	1
gazed	1
with	1
wide	1
open	1
eyes	1
of	1
wonder	1
at	1
Anna	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
dreaming	1
of	1
but	1
now	1
learning	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
too	1
complicated	1
a	1
problem	1
	1
N	1
est	1
ce	1
pas	1
immoral	1
	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
pause	1
Why	1
so	1
Think	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
choice	1
between	1
two	1
alternatives	1
either	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
child	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
invalid	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
friend	1
and	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
husband	1
practically	1
my	1
husband	1
Anna	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
intentionally	1
superficial	1
and	1
frivolous	1
Yes	1
yes	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
arguments	1
she	1
had	1
used	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
the	1
same	1
force	1
in	1
them	1
as	1
before	1
For	1
you	1
for	1
other	1
people	1
said	1
Anna	1
as	1
though	1
divining	1
her	1
thoughts	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
reason	1
to	1
hesitate	1
but	1
for	1
me	1
You	1
must	1
consider	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
And	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
love	1
Not	1
like	1
this	1
She	1
moved	1
her	1
white	1
hands	1
in	1
a	1
curve	1
before	1
her	1
waist	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
rapidity	1
as	1
happens	1
during	1
moments	1
of	1
excitement	1
ideas	1
and	1
memories	1
rushed	1
into	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
head	1
I	1
she	1
thought	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
my	1
attraction	1
for	1
Stiva	1
he	1
left	1
me	1
for	1
others	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
woman	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
betrayed	1
me	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
him	1
by	1
being	1
always	1
pretty	1
and	1
lively	1
He	1
deserted	1
her	1
and	1
took	1
another	1
And	1
can	1
Anna	1
attract	1
and	1
keep	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
If	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
looks	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
find	1
dresses	1
and	1
manners	1
still	1
more	1
attractive	1
and	1
charming	1
And	1
however	1
white	1
and	1
beautiful	1
her	1
bare	1
arms	1
are	1
however	1
beautiful	1
her	1
full	1
figure	1
and	1
her	1
eager	1
face	1
under	1
her	1
black	1
curls	1
he	1
will	1
find	1
something	1
better	1
still	1
just	1
as	1
my	1
disgusting	1
pitiful	1
and	1
charming	1
husband	1
does	1
Dolly	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
she	1
merely	1
sighed	1
Anna	1
noticed	1
this	1
sigh	1
indicating	1
dissent	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
In	1
her	1
armory	1
she	1
had	1
other	1
arguments	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
no	1
answer	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
them	1
Do	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
consider	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
you	1
forget	1
my	1
position	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
desire	1
children	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
suffering	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
that	1
Think	1
only	1
what	1
are	1
my	1
children	1
to	1
be	1
Ill	1
fated	1
children	1
who	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
a	1
stranger	1
s	1
name	1
For	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
of	1
their	1
birth	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
mother	1
their	1
father	1
their	1
birth	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
why	1
a	1
divorce	1
is	1
necessary	1
But	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
convinced	1
herself	1
What	1
is	1
reason	1
given	1
me	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
to	1
avoid	1
bringing	1
unhappy	1
beings	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Dolly	1
but	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
should	1
always	1
feel	1
I	1
had	1
wronged	1
these	1
unhappy	1
children	1
she	1
said	1
If	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
unhappy	1
while	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
unhappy	1
I	1
alone	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
arguments	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
used	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
reflections	1
but	1
she	1
heard	1
them	1
without	1
understanding	1
them	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
wrong	1
creatures	1
that	1
don	1
t	1
exist	1
she	1
thought	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
idea	1
struck	1
her	1
could	1
it	1
possibly	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
her	1
favorite	1
Grisha	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
existed	1
And	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
wild	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1
this	1
tangle	1
of	1
whirling	1
mad	1
ideas	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
right	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
disgust	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
Yes	1
but	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
forget	1
that	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
And	1
besides	1
that	1
added	1
Anna	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
her	1
arguments	1
and	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
Dolly	1
s	1
objections	1
seeming	1
still	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
don	1
t	1
forget	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
as	1
you	1
For	1
you	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
do	1
you	1
desire	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
children	1
while	1
for	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
do	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
You	1
must	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
desire	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
She	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
Anna	1
that	1
there	1
lay	1
between	1
them	1
a	1
barrier	1
of	1
questions	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
agree	1
and	1
about	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
Chapter	1
24	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
reason	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
legalize	1
your	1
position	1
if	1
possible	1
said	1
Dolly	1
Yes	1
if	1
possible	1
said	1
Anna	1
speaking	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
an	1
utterly	1
different	1
tone	1
subdued	1
and	1
mournful	1
Surely	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
mean	1
a	1
divorce	1
is	1
impossible	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
your	1
husband	1
had	1
consented	1
to	1
it	1
Dolly	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
that	1
Oh	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
then	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
hastened	1
to	1
say	1
noticing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
suffering	1
on	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
All	1
I	1
see	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
take	1
too	1
gloomy	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
things	1
I	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1

Yes	1
to	1

the	1
truth	1
I	1
don	1

like	1
Veslovsky	1
s	1
tone	1
said	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
anxious	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
nonsense	1
It	1
amuses	1
Alexey	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
boy	1
and	1
quite	1
under	1
my	1
control	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
turn	1
him	1
as	1
I	1
please	1
It	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
Grisha	1
Dolly	1
she	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
you	1
say	1
I	1
take	1
too	1
gloomy	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
things	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
It	1
s	1
too	1
awful	1
I	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
view	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
But	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
you	1
can	1
But	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
Nothing	1
You	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
marry	1
Alexey	1
and	1
say	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
don	1

about	1
it	1
she	1
repeated	1
and	1
a	1
flush	1
rose	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
straightening	1
her	1
chest	1
and	1
sighed	1
heavily	1
With	1
her	1
light	1
step	1
she	1
began	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
stopping	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
Not	1
a	1
day	1
not	1
an	1
hour	1
passes	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
blame	1
myself	1
for	1
thinking	1
of	1
it	1
because	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
may	1
drive	1
me	1
mad	1
Drive	1
me	1
mad	1
she	1
repeated	1
When	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
sleep	1
without	1
morphine	1
But	1
never	1
mind	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
quietly	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
divorce	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
divorce	1
He	1
s	1
under	1

Alexandrovna	1
sitting	1
erect	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
turned	1
her	1
head	1
following	1
Anna	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
of	1
sympathetic	1
suffering	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
attempt	1
she	1
said	1
softly	1
Suppose	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
attempt	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
she	1
said	1
evidently	1
giving	1
utterance	1
to	1
a	1
thought	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
thought	1
over	1
and	1
learned	1
by	1
heart	1
It	1
means	1
that	1
I	1
hating	1
him	1
but	1
still	1
recognizing	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
wronged	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
consider	1
him	1
magnanimous	1
that	1
I	1
humiliate	1
myself	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
Well	1
suppose	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
effort	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
Either	1
I	1
receive	1
a	1
humiliating	1
refusal	1
or	1
consent	1
Well	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
his	1
consent	1
say	1
Anna	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
furthest	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
stopped	1
there	1
doing	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
curtain	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
I	1
receive	1
his	1
consent	1
but	1
my	1
my	1
son	1
They	1
won	1
t	1
give	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
He	1
will	1
grow	1
up	1
despising	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
whom	1
I	1
ve	1
abandoned	1
Do	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
love	1
equally	1
I	1
think	1
but	1
both	1
more	1
than	1
myself	1
two	1
creatures	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
Alexey	1
She	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
stood	1
facing	1
Dolly	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
pressed	1
tightly	1
across	1
her	1
chest	1
In	1
her	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown	1
her	1
figure	1
seemed	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
grand	1
and	1
broad	1
She	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
with	1
shining	1
wet	1
eyes	1
looked	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows	1
at	1
Dolly	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
pitiful	1
figure	1
in	1
her	1
patched	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
and	1
nightcap	1
shaking	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
emotion	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
those	1
two	1
creatures	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
one	1
excludes	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
have	1
them	1
together	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
want	1
And	1
since	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
have	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
about	1
the	1
rest	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
about	1
anything	1
anything	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
end	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
So	1
don	1
t	1
blame	1
me	1
don	1
t	1
judge	1
me	1
for	1
anything	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
with	1
your	1
pure	1
heart	1
understand	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
suffering	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Dolly	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
guilty	1
look	1
peeped	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
What	1
are	1

about	1
me	1
Don	1
t	1

me	1
I	1
don	1

contempt	1
I	1
m	1
simply	1
unhappy	1
If	1
anyone	1
is	1
unhappy	1
I	1
am	1
she	1
articulated	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
Left	1
alone	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
said	1
her	1
prayers	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
She	1
had	1
felt	1
for	1
Anna	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
force	1
herself	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
The	1
memories	1
of	1
home	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
children	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
charm	1
quite	1
new	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
new	1
brilliance	1
That	1
world	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
precious	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
spend	1
an	1
extra	1
day	1
outside	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
certainly	1
go	1
back	1
next	1
day	1
Anna	1
meantime	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
boudoir	1
took	1
a	1
wine	1
glass	1
and	1
dropped	1
into	1
it	1
several	1
drops	1
of	1
a	1
medicine	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
principal	1
ingredient	1
was	1
morphine	1
After	1
drinking	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
sitting	1
still	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
bedroom	1
in	1
a	1
soothed	1
and	1
more	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
When	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
Vronsky	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
staying	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
Dolly	1
s	1
room	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
with	1
her	1
But	1
in	1
her	1
expression	1
of	1
restrained	1
excitement	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
reserve	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
beauty	1
that	1
always	1
bewitched	1
him	1
afresh	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
affect	1
him	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
but	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
something	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
But	1
she	1
only	1
said	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
you	1
like	1
Dolly	1
You	1
do	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
Oh	1
I	1
ve	1
known	1
her	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
you	1
know	1
She	1
s	1
very	1
good	1
hearted	1
I	1
suppose	1
mais	1
excessivement	1
terre	1
`a	1
terre	1
	1
Still	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
He	1
took	1
Anna	1
s	1
hand	1
and	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
Misinterpreting	1
the	1
look	1
she	1
smiled	1
to	1
him	1
Next	1
morning	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
protests	1
of	1
her	1
hosts	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
prepared	1
for	1
her	1
homeward	1
journey	1
Levin	1
s	1
coachman	1
in	1
his	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
new	1
coat	1
and	1
shabby	1
hat	1
with	1
his	1
ill	1
matched	1
horses	1
and	1
his	1
coach	1
with	1
the	1
patched	1
mud	1
guards	1
drove	1
with	1
gloomy	1
determination	1
into	1
the	1
covered	1
gravel	1
approach	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
disliked	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
After	1
a	1
day	1
spent	1
together	1
both	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
hosts	1
were	1
distinctly	1
aware	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
on	1
together	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
meet	1
Only	1
Anna	1
was	1
sad	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
now	1
from	1
Dolly	1
s	1
departure	1
no	1
one	1
again	1
would	1
stir	1
up	1
within	1
her	1
soul	1
the	1
feelings	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
roused	1
by	1
their	1
conversation	1
It	1
hurt	1
her	1
to	1
stir	1
up	1
these	1
feelings	1
but	1
yet	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
would	1
quickly	1
be	1
smothered	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
she	1
was	1
leading	1
As	1
she	1
drove	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
had	1
a	1
delightful	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
tempted	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
liked	1
being	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
when	1
suddenly	1
the	1
coachman	1
Philip	1
expressed	1
himself	1
unasked	1
Rolling	1
in	1
wealth	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
three	1
pots	1
of	1
oats	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
gave	1
us	1
Everything	1
cleared	1
up	1
till	1
there	1
wasn	1
t	1
a	1
grain	1
left	1
by	1
cockcrow	1
What	1
are	1
three	1
pots	1
A	1
mere	1
mouthful	1
And	1
oats	1
now	1
down	1
to	1
forty	1
five	1
kopecks	1
At	1
our	1
place	1
no	1
fear	1
all	1
comers	1
may	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
eat	1
The	1
master	1
s	1
a	1
screw	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
counting	1
house	1
clerk	1
Well	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
their	1
horses	1
asked	1
Dolly	1
The	1
horses	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
two	1
opinions	1
about	1
them	1
And	1
the	1
food	1
was	1
good	1
But	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
sort	1
of	1
dreary	1
there	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
thought	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
his	1
handsome	1
good	1
natured	1
face	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
thought	1
so	1
too	1
Well	1
shall	1
we	1
get	1
home	1
by	1
evening	1
Eh	1
we	1
must	1
On	1
reaching	1
home	1
and	1
finding	1
everyone	1
entirely	1
satisfactory	1
and	1
particularly	1
charming	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
began	1
with	1
great	1
liveliness	1
telling	1
them	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
arrived	1
how	1
warmly	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
luxury	1
and	1
good	1
taste	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Vronskys	1
lived	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
recreations	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
against	1
them	1
One	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
Anna	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
know	1
him	1
better	1
now	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
nice	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
how	1
touching	1
she	1
said	1
speaking	1
now	1
with	1
perfect	1
sincerity	1
and	1
forgetting	1
the	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
and	1
awkwardness	1
she	1
had	1
experienced	1
there	1
Chapter	1
25	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
summer	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
living	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
and	1
still	1
taking	1
no	1
steps	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
divorce	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
understood	1
thing	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
anywhere	1
but	1
both	1
felt	1
the	1
longer	1
they	1
lived	1
alone	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
without	1
guests	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
this	1
existence	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
alter	1
it	1
Their	1
life	1
was	1
apparently	1
such	1
that	1
nothing	1
better	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
They	1
had	1
the	1
fullest	1
abundance	1
of	1
everything	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
both	1
had	1
occupation	1
Anna	1
devoted	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
care	1
to	1
her	1
appearance	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
visitors	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
reading	1
both	1
of	1
novels	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
serious	1
literature	1
was	1
in	1
fashion	1
She	1
ordered	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
were	1
praised	1
in	1
the	1
foreign	1
papers	1
and	1
reviews	1
she	1
received	1
and	1
read	1
them	1
with	1
that	1
concentrated	1
attention	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
given	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
read	1
in	1
seclusion	1
Moreover	1
every	1
subject	1
that	1
was	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
she	1
studied	1
in	1
books	1
and	1
special	1
journals	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
often	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
questions	1
relating	1
to	1
agriculture	1
or	1
architecture	1
sometimes	1
even	1
with	1
questions	1
relating	1
to	1
horse	1
breeding	1
or	1
sport	1
He	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
her	1
knowledge	1
her	1
memory	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
confirmation	1
of	1
her	1
facts	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
what	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
in	1
some	1
book	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
hospital	1
too	1
interested	1
her	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
merely	1
assist	1
but	1
planned	1
and	1
suggested	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
herself	1
But	1
her	1
chief	1
thought	1
was	1
still	1
of	1
herself	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
Vronsky	1
appreciated	1
this	1
desire	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
please	1
but	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
sole	1
aim	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
wearied	1
of	1
the	1
loving	1
snares	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
fast	1
As	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
held	1
fast	1
in	1
these	1
snares	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
ever	1
growing	1
desire	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
them	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
whether	1
they	1
hindered	1
his	1
freedom	1
Had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
this	1
growing	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
scenes	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
to	1
a	1
meeting	1
or	1
a	1
race	1
Vronsky	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
life	1
The	1
r^ole	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
r^ole	1
of	1
a	1
wealthy	1
landowner	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
aristocracy	1
was	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
taste	1
and	1
now	1
after	1
spending	1
six	1
months	1
in	1
that	1
character	1
he	1
derived	1
even	1
greater	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
it	1
And	1
his	1
management	1
of	1
his	1
estate	1
which	1
occupied	1
and	1
absorbed	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
was	1
most	1
successful	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
sums	1
cost	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hospital	1
by	1
machinery	1
by	1
cows	1
ordered	1
from	1
Switzerland	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wasting	1
but	1
increasing	1
his	1
substance	1
In	1
all	1
matters	1
affecting	1
income	1
the	1
sales	1
of	1
timber	1
wheat	1
and	1
wool	1
the	1
letting	1
of	1
lands	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
hard	1
as	1
a	1
rock	1
and	1
knew	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
prices	1
In	1
all	1
operations	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
his	1
other	1
estates	1
he	1
kept	1
to	1
the	1
simplest	1
methods	1
involving	1
no	1
risk	1
and	1
in	1
trifling	1
details	1
he	1
was	1
careful	1
and	1
exacting	1
to	1
an	1
extreme	1
degree	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cunning	1
and	1
ingenuity	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
steward	1
who	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
tempt	1
him	1
into	1
purchases	1
by	1
making	1
his	1
original	1
estimate	1
always	1
far	1
larger	1
than	1
really	1
required	1
and	1
then	1
representing	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
get	1
the	1
thing	1
cheaper	1
and	1
so	1
make	1
a	1
profit	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
steward	1
cross	1
examined	1
him	1
and	1
only	1
agreed	1
to	1
his	1
suggestions	1
when	1
the	1
implement	1
to	1
be	1
ordered	1
or	1
constructed	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
newest	1
not	1
yet	1
known	1
in	1
Russia	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
excite	1
wonder	1
Apart	1
from	1
such	1
exceptions	1
he	1
resolved	1
upon	1
an	1
increased	1
outlay	1
only	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
surplus	1
and	1
in	1
making	1
such	1
an	1
outlay	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
getting	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
for	1
his	1
money	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
method	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
managed	1
his	1
affairs	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wasting	1
but	1
increasing	1
his	1
substance	1
In	1
October	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
provincial	1
elections	1
in	1
the	1
Kashinsky	1
province	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
estates	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
Sviazhsky	1
Koznishev	1
Oblonsky	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
land	1
These	1
elections	1
were	1
attracting	1
public	1
attention	1
from	1
several	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
also	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
them	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
talk	1
about	1
them	1
and	1
great	1
preparations	1
were	1
being	1
made	1
for	1
them	1
Persons	1
who	1
never	1
attended	1
the	1
elections	1
were	1
coming	1
from	1
Moscow	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
from	1
abroad	1
to	1
attend	1
these	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
long	1
before	1
promised	1
Sviazhsky	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
them	1
Before	1
the	1
elections	1
Sviazhsky	1
who	1
often	1
visited	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
drove	1
over	1
to	1
fetch	1
Vronsky	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
a	1
quarrel	1
between	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
over	1
this	1
proposed	1
expedition	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
dullest	1
autumn	1
weather	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
dreary	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
so	1
preparing	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
struggle	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
a	1
hard	1
and	1
cold	1
expression	1
informed	1
Anna	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
But	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
Anna	1
accepted	1
the	1
information	1
with	1
great	1
composure	1
and	1
merely	1
asked	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
back	1
He	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
her	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
explain	1
this	1
composure	1
She	1
smiled	1
at	1
his	1
look	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
way	1
she	1
had	1
of	1
withdrawing	1
into	1
herself	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
only	1
happened	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
determined	1
upon	1
something	1
without	1
letting	1
him	1
know	1
her	1
plans	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
scene	1
that	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
appearances	1
and	1
half	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
her	1
reasonableness	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
dull	1
I	1
hope	1
not	1
said	1
Anna	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
books	1
yesterday	1
from	1
Gautier	1
s	1
No	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
dull	1
She	1
s	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
tone	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
he	1
thought	1
or	1
else	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
elections	1
without	1
appealing	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
candid	1
explanation	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
their	1
intimacy	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
parted	1
from	1
her	1
without	1
a	1
full	1
explanation	1
From	1
one	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
this	1
troubled	1
him	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
so	1
At	1
first	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
this	1
time	1
something	1
undefined	1
kept	1
back	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
will	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
up	1
anything	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
not	1
my	1
masculine	1
independence	1
he	1
thought	1
Chapter	1
26	1
In	1
September	1
Levin	1
moved	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
Kitty	1
s	1
confinement	1
He	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
in	1
Moscow	1
with	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
property	1
in	1
the	1
Kashinsky	1
province	1
and	1
took	1
great	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
elections	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
elections	1
He	1
invited	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1
Seleznevsky	1
district	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
had	1
moreover	1
to	1
transact	1
in	1
Kashin	1
some	1
extremely	1
important	1
business	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
wardship	1
of	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
receiving	1
of	1
certain	1
redemption	1
money	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
who	1
was	1
abroad	1
Levin	1
still	1
hesitated	1
but	1
Kitty	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
bored	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
authority	1
ordered	1
him	1
the	1
proper	1
nobleman	1
s	1
uniform	1
costing	1
seven	1
pounds	1
And	1
that	1
seven	1
pounds	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
uniform	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
cause	1
that	1
finally	1
decided	1
Levin	1
to	1
go	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Kashin	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
Kashin	1
visiting	1
the	1
assembly	1
each	1
day	1
and	1
busily	1
engaged	1
about	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
business	1
which	1
still	1
dragged	1
on	1
The	1
district	1
marshals	1
of	1
nobility	1
were	1
all	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
elections	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
simplest	1
thing	1
done	1
that	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
wardship	1
The	1
other	1
matter	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
sums	1
due	1
was	1
met	1
too	1
by	1
difficulties	1
After	1
long	1
negotiations	1
over	1
the	1
legal	1
details	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
but	1
the	1
notary	1
a	1
most	1
obliging	1
person	1
could	1
not	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
order	1
because	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
signature	1
of	1
the	1
president	1
and	1
the	1
president	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
over	1
his	1
duties	1
to	1
a	1
deputy	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
All	1
these	1
worrying	1
negotiations	1
this	1
endless	1
going	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
pleasant	1
and	1
excellent	1
people	1
who	1
quite	1
saw	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
of	1
the	1
petitioner	1
s	1
position	1
but	1
were	1
powerless	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
all	1
these	1
efforts	1
that	1
yielded	1
no	1
result	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
misery	1
in	1
Levin	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
mortifying	1
helplessness	1
one	1
experiences	1
in	1
dreams	1
when	1
one	1
tries	1
to	1
use	1
physical	1
force	1
He	1
felt	1
this	1
frequently	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
most	1
good	1
natured	1
solicitor	1
This	1
solicitor	1
did	1
it	1
seemed	1
everything	1
possible	1
and	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
difficulties	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
he	1
said	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
go	1
to	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
so	1
and	1
the	1
solicitor	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
regular	1
plan	1
for	1
getting	1
round	1
the	1
fatal	1
point	1
that	1
hindered	1
everything	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
add	1
immediately	1
It	1
ll	1
mean	1
some	1
delay	1
anyway	1
but	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
it	1
And	1
Levin	1
did	1
try	1
and	1
did	1
go	1
Everyone	1
was	1
kind	1
and	1
civil	1
but	1
the	1
point	1
evaded	1
seemed	1
to	1
crop	1
up	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
way	1
What	1
was	1
particularly	1
trying	1
was	1
that	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
struggling	1
to	1
whose	1
interest	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
his	1
business	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
That	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
solicitor	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
If	1
Levin	1
could	1
have	1
understood	1
why	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
why	1
one	1
can	1
only	1
approach	1
the	1
booking	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
railway	1
station	1
in	1
single	1
file	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
vexatious	1
and	1
tiresome	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
hindrances	1
that	1
confronted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
business	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
explain	1
why	1
they	1
existed	1
But	1
Levin	1
had	1
changed	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
he	1
was	1
patient	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
arranged	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
judge	1
without	1
knowing	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
most	1
likely	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
fret	1
In	1
attending	1
the	1
elections	1
too	1
and	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
them	1
he	1
tried	1
now	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
not	1
to	1
fall	1
foul	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
to	1
comprehend	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
earnestly	1
and	1
ardently	1
absorbing	1
honest	1
and	1
excellent	1
men	1
whom	1
he	1
respected	1
Since	1
his	1
marriage	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
Levin	1
so	1
many	1
new	1
and	1
serious	1
aspects	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
had	1
previously	1
through	1
his	1
frivolous	1
attitude	1
to	1
them	1
seemed	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
elections	1
too	1
he	1
assumed	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
serious	1
significance	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
meaning	1
and	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
revolution	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
The	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
in	1
whose	1
hands	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
important	1
public	1
functions	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
wards	1
the	1
very	1
department	1
which	1
was	1
giving	1
Levin	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
just	1
now	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
large	1
sums	1
subscribed	1
by	1
the	1
nobility	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
the	1
high	1
schools	1
female	1
male	1
and	1
military	1
and	1
popular	1
instruction	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
model	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Snetkov	1
was	1
a	1
nobleman	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
school	1
dissipating	1
an	1
immense	1
fortune	1
a	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
honest	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
fashion	1
but	1
utterly	1
without	1
any	1
comprehension	1
of	1
the	1
needs	1
of	1
modern	1
days	1
He	1
always	1
took	1
in	1
every	1
question	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
antagonistic	1
to	1
the	1
spread	1
of	1
popular	1
education	1
and	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
giving	1
a	1
purely	1
party	1
character	1
to	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
which	1
ought	1
by	1
rights	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
immense	1
importance	1
What	1
was	1
needed	1
was	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
a	1
fresh	1
capable	1
perfectly	1
modern	1
man	1
of	1
contemporary	1
ideas	1
and	1
to	1
frame	1
their	1
policy	1
so	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
rights	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
nobles	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
nobility	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
element	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
to	1
extract	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
self	1
government	1
that	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
them	1
In	1
the	1
wealthy	1
Kashinsky	1
province	1
which	1
always	1
took	1
the	1
lead	1
of	1
other	1
provinces	1
in	1
everything	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
such	1
a	1
preponderance	1
of	1
forces	1
that	1
this	1
policy	1
once	1
carried	1
through	1
properly	1
there	1
might	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
for	1
other	1
provinces	1
for	1
all	1
Russia	1
And	1
hence	1
the	1
whole	1
question	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
importance	1
It	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
elect	1
as	1
marshal	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
Snetkov	1
either	1
Sviazhsky	1
or	1
better	1
still	1
Nevyedovsky	1
a	1
former	1
university	1
professor	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
remarkable	1
intelligence	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
The	1
meeting	1
was	1
opened	1
by	1
the	1
governor	1
who	1
made	1
a	1
speech	1
to	1
the	1
nobles	1
urging	1
them	1
to	1
elect	1
the	1
public	1
functionaries	1
not	1
from	1
regard	1
for	1
persons	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
welfare	1
of	1
their	1
fatherland	1
and	1
hoping	1
that	1
the	1
honorable	1
nobility	1
of	1
the	1
Kashinsky	1
province	1
would	1
as	1
at	1
all	1
former	1
elections	1
hold	1
their	1
duty	1
as	1
sacred	1
and	1
vindicate	1
the	1
exalted	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
with	1
his	1
speech	1
the	1
governor	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
the	1
noblemen	1
noisily	1
and	1
eagerly	1
some	1
even	1
enthusiastically	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
thronged	1
round	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
and	1
conversed	1
amicably	1
with	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Levin	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
into	1
everything	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
anything	1
stood	1
there	1
too	1
in	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
governor	1
say	1
Please	1
tell	1
Marya	1
Ivanovna	1
my	1
wife	1
is	1
very	1
sorry	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
Home	1
And	1
thereupon	1
the	1
nobles	1
in	1
high	1
good	1
humor	1
sorted	1
out	1
their	1
fur	1
coats	1
and	1
all	1
drove	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
cathedral	1
In	1
the	1
cathedral	1
Levin	1
lifting	1
his	1
hand	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
repeating	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
archdeacon	1
swore	1
with	1
most	1
terrible	1
oaths	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
hoped	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
Church	1
services	1
always	1
affected	1
Levin	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
kiss	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
men	1
repeating	1
the	1
same	1
he	1
felt	1
touched	1
On	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
third	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
business	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
finances	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
and	1
the	1
female	1
high	1
school	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
whatever	1
as	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
explained	1
and	1
Levin	1
busy	1
seeing	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
did	1
not	1
attend	1
the	1
meetings	1
On	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
the	1
auditing	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
s	1
accounts	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
And	1
then	1
there	1
occurred	1
the	1
first	1
skirmish	1
between	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
The	1
committee	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
deputed	1
to	1
verify	1
the	1
accounts	1
reported	1
to	1
the	1
meeting	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
in	1
order	1
The	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
got	1
up	1
thanked	1
the	1
nobility	1
for	1
their	1
confidence	1
and	1
shed	1
tears	1
The	1
nobles	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
loud	1
welcome	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
nobleman	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
party	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
committee	1
had	1
not	1
verified	1
the	1
accounts	1
considering	1
such	1
a	1
verification	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
incautiously	1
admitted	1
this	1
Then	1
a	1
small	1
gentleman	1
very	1
young	1
looking	1
but	1
very	1
malignant	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
expenditures	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
moneys	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
misplaced	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
was	1
depriving	1
him	1
of	1
this	1
moral	1
satisfaction	1
Then	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
tried	1
to	1
withdraw	1
their	1
admission	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
began	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
logically	1
admit	1
either	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
verified	1
the	1
accounts	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
and	1
he	1
developed	1
this	1
dilemma	1
in	1
detail	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
spokesman	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
party	1
Then	1
Sviazhsky	1
spoke	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
again	1
The	1
discussion	1
lasted	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
and	1
ended	1
in	1
nothing	1
Levin	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
dispute	1
upon	1
this	1
subject	1
so	1
long	1
especially	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
whether	1
he	1
supposed	1
that	1
money	1
had	1
been	1
misappropriated	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
answered	1
Oh	1
no	1
He	1
s	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
But	1
those	1
old	1
fashioned	1
methods	1
of	1
paternal	1
family	1
arrangements	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
provincial	1
affairs	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
down	1
On	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
came	1
the	1
elections	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
marshals	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
stormy	1
day	1
in	1
several	1
districts	1
In	1
the	1
Seleznevsky	1
district	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
elected	1
unanimously	1
without	1
a	1
ballot	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
dinner	1
that	1
evening	1
Chapter	1
27	1
The	1
sixth	1
day	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
The	1
rooms	1
large	1
and	1
small	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
noblemen	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
uniforms	1
Many	1
had	1
come	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
Men	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
years	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
Crimea	1
some	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
some	1
from	1
abroad	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
of	1
the	1
Hall	1
of	1
Nobility	1
There	1
was	1
much	1
discussion	1
around	1
the	1
governor	1
s	1
table	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar	1
The	1
nobles	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
larger	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
rooms	1
grouped	1
themselves	1
in	1
camps	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
hostile	1
and	1
suspicious	1
glances	1
from	1
the	1
silence	1
that	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
when	1
outsiders	1
approached	1
a	1
group	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
some	1
whispering	1
together	1
retreated	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
corridor	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
each	1
side	1
had	1
secrets	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
In	1
appearance	1
the	1
noblemen	1
were	1
sharply	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
classes	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
The	1
old	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
either	1
in	1
old	1
uniforms	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
buttoned	1
up	1
closely	1
with	1
spurs	1
and	1
hats	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
special	1
naval	1
cavalry	1
infantry	1
or	1
official	1
uniforms	1
The	1
uniforms	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
men	1
were	1
embroidered	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
fashioned	1
way	1
with	1
epaulets	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
they	1
were	1
unmistakably	1
tight	1
and	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
waist	1
as	1
though	1
their	1
wearers	1
had	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
The	1
younger	1
men	1
wore	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
with	1
long	1
waists	1
and	1
broad	1
shoulders	1
unbuttoned	1
over	1
white	1
waistcoats	1
or	1
uniforms	1
with	1
black	1
collars	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
embroidered	1
badges	1
of	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
To	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
belonged	1
the	1
court	1
uniforms	1
that	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
brightened	1
up	1
the	1
crowd	1
But	1
the	1
division	1
into	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
with	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
parties	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
as	1
Levin	1
observed	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
party	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
oldest	1
noblemen	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
were	1
whispering	1
with	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
ardent	1
partisans	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
Levin	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
smaller	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
taking	1
light	1
refreshments	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
friends	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying	1
he	1
conscientiously	1
exerted	1
all	1
his	1
intelligence	1
trying	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
round	1
which	1
the	1
others	1
grouped	1
themselves	1
He	1
was	1
listening	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
Hliustov	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
another	1
district	1
who	1
belonged	1
to	1
their	1
party	1
Hliustov	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
his	1
district	1
to	1
ask	1
Snetkov	1
to	1
stand	1
while	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
approving	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
why	1
the	1
opposition	1
was	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
marshal	1
to	1
stand	1
whom	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
supersede	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
drinking	1
and	1
taking	1
some	1
lunch	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
uniform	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
wiping	1
his	1
lips	1
with	1
a	1
perfumed	1
handkerchief	1
of	1
bordered	1
batiste	1
We	1
are	1
placing	1
our	1
forces	1
he	1
said	1
pulling	1
out	1
his	1
whiskers	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
And	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
supported	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
contention	1
One	1
district	1
s	1
enough	1
and	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
obviously	1
of	1
the	1
opposition	1
he	1
said	1
words	1
evidently	1
intelligible	1
to	1
all	1
except	1
Levin	1
Why	1
Kostya	1
you	1
here	1
too	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
re	1
converted	1
eh	1
he	1
added	1
turning	1
to	1
Levin	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
arm	1
through	1
his	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
converted	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
and	1
retreating	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
from	1
the	1
speakers	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
his	1
inability	1
to	1
understand	1
why	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
should	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
stand	1
	1
O	1
sancta	1
simplicitas	1
	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
briefly	1
and	1
clearly	1
he	1
explained	1
it	1
to	1
Levin	1
If	1
as	1
at	1
previous	1
elections	1
all	1
the	1
districts	1
asked	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
to	1
stand	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
elected	1
without	1
a	1
ballot	1
That	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
Now	1
eight	1
districts	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
if	1
two	1
refused	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
Snetkov	1
might	1
decline	1
to	1
stand	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
old	1
party	1
might	1
choose	1
another	1
of	1
their	1
party	1
which	1
would	1
throw	1
them	1
completely	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
reckoning	1
But	1
if	1
only	1
one	1
district	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
Snetkov	1
would	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
balloted	1
for	1
They	1
were	1
even	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
going	1
to	1
vote	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
purposely	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
votes	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
might	1
be	1
thrown	1
off	1
the	1
scent	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
candidate	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
was	1
put	1
up	1
they	1
too	1
might	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
votes	1
Levin	1
understood	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
but	1
not	1
fully	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
questions	1
when	1
suddenly	1
everyone	1
began	1
talking	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
noise	1
and	1
they	1
moved	1
towards	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
eh	1
whom	1
No	1
guarantee	1
whose	1
what	1
They	1
won	1
t	1
pass	1
him	1
No	1
guarantee	1
They	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
Flerov	1
in	1
Eh	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
charge	1
against	1
him	1
Why	1
at	1
this	1
rate	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
admit	1
anyone	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
swindle	1
The	1
law	1
Levin	1
heard	1
exclamations	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
hurrying	1
somewhere	1
and	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
something	1
Squeezed	1
by	1
the	1
crowding	1
noblemen	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
where	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
leaders	1
were	1
hotly	1
disputing	1
about	1
something	1
Chapter	1
28	1
Levin	1
was	1
standing	1
rather	1
far	1
off	1
A	1
nobleman	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
hoarsely	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
another	1
whose	1
thick	1
boots	1
were	1
creaking	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
hearing	1
distinctly	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
hear	1
the	1
soft	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
faintly	1
then	1
the	1
shrill	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Sviazhsky	1
They	1
were	1
disputing	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
the	1
exact	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
up	1
for	1
trial	1
The	1
crowd	1
parted	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
approaching	1
the	1
table	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
best	1
solution	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
refer	1
to	1
the	1
act	1
itself	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
secretary	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
act	1
The	1
act	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
ballot	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
read	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
its	1
meaning	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
a	1
tall	1
stout	1
round	1
shouldered	1
landowner	1
with	1
dyed	1
whiskers	1
in	1
a	1
tight	1
uniform	1
that	1
cut	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
neck	1
interrupted	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
striking	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
ring	1
he	1
shouted	1
loudly	1
A	1
ballot	1
Put	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
vote	1
No	1
need	1
for	1
more	1
talking	1
Then	1
several	1
voices	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
nobleman	1
with	1
the	1
ring	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
exasperated	1
shouted	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
loudly	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
He	1
was	1
shouting	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
course	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
proposed	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
hated	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
party	1
and	1
this	1
feeling	1
of	1
hatred	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
and	1
roused	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
vindictiveness	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
seemly	1
form	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Shouts	1
were	1
raised	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
all	1
was	1
confusion	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
had	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
order	1
A	1
ballot	1
A	1
ballot	1
Every	1
nobleman	1
sees	1
it	1
We	1
shed	1
our	1
blood	1
for	1
our	1
country	1
The	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
No	1
checking	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
cashier	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
point	1
Votes	1
please	1
Beastly	1
shouted	1
furious	1
and	1
violent	1
voices	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
Looks	1
and	1
faces	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
violent	1
and	1
furious	1
than	1
their	1
words	1
They	1
expressed	1
the	1
most	1
implacable	1
hatred	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
he	1
marveled	1
at	1
the	1
passion	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
disputed	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
decision	1
about	1
Flerov	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
vote	1
He	1
forgot	1
as	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
afterwards	1
this	1
syllogism	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
votes	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
votes	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
secure	1
Flerov	1
s	1
right	1
to	1
vote	1
that	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
Flerov	1
s	1
right	1
to	1
vote	1
they	1
must	1
decide	1
on	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
act	1
And	1
one	1
vote	1
may	1
decide	1
the	1
whole	1
question	1
and	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
serious	1
and	1
consecutive	1
if	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
public	1
life	1
concluded	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
But	1
Levin	1
forgot	1
all	1
that	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
excellent	1
persons	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
respect	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
vicious	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
To	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
painful	1
feeling	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
except	1
the	1
waiters	1
at	1
the	1
refreshment	1
bar	1
Seeing	1
the	1
waiters	1
busy	1
over	1
washing	1
up	1
the	1
crockery	1
and	1
setting	1
in	1
order	1
their	1
plates	1
and	1
wine	1
glasses	1
seeing	1
their	1
calm	1
and	1
cheerful	1
faces	1
Levin	1
felt	1
an	1
unexpected	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
stuffy	1
room	1
into	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
He	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
waiters	1
He	1
particularly	1
liked	1
the	1
way	1
one	1
gray	1
whiskered	1
waiter	1
who	1
showed	1
his	1
scorn	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
younger	1
ones	1
and	1
was	1
jeered	1
at	1
by	1
them	1
was	1
teaching	1
them	1
how	1
to	1
fold	1
up	1
napkins	1
properly	1
Levin	1
was	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
waiter	1
when	1
the	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
wardship	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
whose	1
specialty	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
noblemen	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
by	1
name	1
and	1
patronymic	1
drew	1
him	1
away	1
Please	1
come	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
he	1
said	1
your	1
brother	1
s	1
looking	1
for	1
you	1
They	1
are	1
voting	1
on	1
the	1
legal	1
point	1
Levin	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
received	1
a	1
white	1
ball	1
and	1
followed	1
his	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
and	1
ironical	1
face	1
holding	1
his	1
beard	1
in	1
his	1
fist	1
and	1
sniffing	1
at	1
it	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
box	1
put	1
the	1
ball	1
somewhere	1
and	1
making	1
room	1
for	1
Levin	1
stopped	1
Levin	1
advanced	1
but	1
utterly	1
forgetting	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
much	1
embarrassed	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
the	1
question	1
Where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
He	1
asked	1
this	1
softly	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
talking	1
going	1
on	1
near	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
his	1
question	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
overheard	1
But	1
the	1
persons	1
speaking	1
paused	1
and	1
his	1
improper	1
question	1
was	1
overheard	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
frowned	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
for	1
each	1
man	1
s	1
own	1
decision	1
he	1
said	1
severely	1
Several	1
people	1
smiled	1
Levin	1
crimsoned	1
hurriedly	1
thrust	1
his	1
hand	1
under	1
the	1
cloth	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
ball	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
Having	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
thrust	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
too	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
thrust	1
it	1
in	1
though	1
too	1
late	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
overcome	1
with	1
confusion	1
he	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat	1
into	1
the	1
background	1
A	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
six	1
for	1
admission	1
Ninety	1
eight	1
against	1
sang	1
out	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
secretary	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
pronounce	1
the	1
letter	1
r	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
laugh	1
a	1
button	1
and	1
two	1
nuts	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
box	1
The	1
nobleman	1
was	1
allowed	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
vote	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
had	1
conquered	1
But	1
the	1
old	1
party	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
themselves	1
conquered	1
Levin	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
asking	1
Snetkov	1
to	1
stand	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
noblemen	1
was	1
surrounding	1
the	1
marshal	1
who	1
was	1
saying	1
something	1
Levin	1
went	1
nearer	1
In	1
reply	1
Snetkov	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
trust	1
the	1
noblemen	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
had	1
placed	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
affection	1
they	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
deserve	1
as	1
his	1
only	1
merit	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
nobility	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
devoted	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
service	1
Several	1
times	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
powers	1
with	1
truth	1
and	1
good	1
faith	1
I	1
value	1
your	1
goodness	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
from	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
choked	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Whether	1
these	1
tears	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
being	1
done	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
nobility	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
in	1
feeling	1
himself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
enemies	1
his	1
emotion	1
infected	1
the	1
assembly	1
the	1
majority	1
were	1
touched	1
and	1
Levin	1
felt	1
a	1
tenderness	1
for	1
Snetkov	1
In	1
the	1
doorway	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
jostled	1
against	1
Levin	1
Beg	1
pardon	1
excuse	1
me	1
please	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
but	1
recognizing	1
Levin	1
he	1
smiled	1
timidly	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
for	1
emotion	1
His	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
uniform	1
with	1
the	1
crosses	1
and	1
white	1
trousers	1
striped	1
with	1
braid	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
hurriedly	1
along	1
reminded	1
Levin	1
of	1
some	1
hunted	1
beast	1
who	1
sees	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
evil	1
case	1
This	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
marshal	1
s	1
face	1
was	1
particularly	1
touching	1
to	1
Levin	1
because	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
his	1
house	1
about	1
his	1
trustee	1
business	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
grandeur	1
a	1
kind	1
hearted	1
fatherly	1
man	1
The	1
big	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
family	1
furniture	1
the	1
rather	1
dirty	1
far	1
from	1
stylish	1
but	1
respectful	1
footmen	1
unmistakably	1
old	1
house	1
serfs	1
who	1
had	1
stuck	1
to	1
their	1
master	1
the	1
stout	1
good	1
natured	1
wife	1
in	1
a	1
cap	1
with	1
lace	1
and	1
a	1
Turkish	1
shawl	1
petting	1
her	1
pretty	1
grandchild	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
daughter	1
the	1
young	1
son	1
a	1
sixth	1
form	1
high	1
school	1
boy	1
coming	1
home	1
from	1
school	1
and	1
greeting	1
his	1
father	1
kissing	1
his	1
big	1
hand	1
the	1
genuine	1
cordial	1
words	1
and	1
gestures	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
roused	1
an	1
instinctive	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
sympathy	1
in	1
Levin	1
This	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
touching	1
and	1
pathetic	1
figure	1
to	1
Levin	1
now	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
pleasant	1
to	1
him	1
So	1
you	1
re	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
marshal	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
likely	1
said	1
the	1
marshal	1
looking	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
expression	1
I	1
m	1
worn	1
out	1
I	1
m	1
old	1
If	1
there	1
are	1
men	1
younger	1
and	1
more	1
deserving	1
than	1
I	1
let	1
them	1
serve	1
And	1
the	1
marshal	1
disappeared	1
through	1
a	1
side	1
door	1
The	1
most	1
solemn	1
moment	1
was	1
at	1
hand	1
They	1
were	1
to	1
proceed	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
election	1
The	1
leaders	1
of	1
both	1
parties	1
were	1
reckoning	1
white	1
and	1
black	1
on	1
their	1
fingers	1
The	1
discussion	1
upon	1
Flerov	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
not	1
only	1
Flerov	1
s	1
vote	1
but	1
had	1
also	1
gained	1
time	1
for	1
them	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
send	1
to	1
fetch	1
three	1
noblemen	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
rendered	1
unable	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
elections	1
by	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
party	1
Two	1
noble	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
weakness	1
for	1
strong	1
drink	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
drunk	1
by	1
the	1
partisans	1
of	1
Snetkov	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
had	1
been	1
robbed	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
On	1
learning	1
this	1
the	1
new	1
party	1
had	1
made	1
haste	1
during	1
the	1
dispute	1
about	1
Flerov	1
to	1
send	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
sledge	1
to	1
clothe	1
the	1
stripped	1
gentleman	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
along	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
intoxicated	1
to	1
the	1
meeting	1
I	1
ve	1
brought	1
one	1
drenched	1
him	1
with	1
water	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
this	1
errand	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
He	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
ll	1
do	1
Not	1
too	1
drunk	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
fall	1
down	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
No	1
he	1
s	1
first	1
rate	1
If	1
only	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
more	1
here	1
I	1
ve	1
told	1
the	1
waiter	1
not	1

Chapter	1
29	1
The	1
narrow	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
taking	1
refreshments	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
noblemen	1
The	1
excitement	1
grew	1
more	1
intense	1
and	1
every	1
face	1
betrayed	1
some	1
uneasiness	1
The	1
excitement	1
was	1
specially	1
keen	1
for	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
each	1
party	1
who	1
knew	1
every	1
detail	1
and	1
had	1
reckoned	1
up	1
every	1
vote	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
generals	1
organizing	1
the	1
approaching	1
battle	1
The	1
rest	1
like	1
the	1
rank	1
and	1
file	1
before	1
an	1
engagement	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
fight	1
sought	1
for	1
other	1
distractions	1
in	1
the	1
interval	1
Some	1
were	1
lunching	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
bar	1
or	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
others	1
were	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
room	1
smoking	1
cigarettes	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
friends	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
smoking	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
own	1
friends	1
that	1
is	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
because	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
his	1
equerry	1
s	1
uniform	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
eager	1
conversation	1
Levin	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
already	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
studiously	1
avoided	1
him	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
greet	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
scanning	1
the	1
groups	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
around	1
him	1
He	1
felt	1
depressed	1
especially	1
because	1
everyone	1
else	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
eager	1
anxious	1
and	1
interested	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
toothless	1
little	1
man	1
with	1
mumbling	1
lips	1
wearing	1
a	1
naval	1
uniform	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him	1
had	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
He	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
blackguard	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
so	1
but	1
it	1
makes	1
no	1
difference	1
Only	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
He	1
couldn	1
t	1
collect	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
heard	1
vigorously	1
uttered	1
by	1
a	1
round	1
shouldered	1
short	1
country	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
pomaded	1
hair	1
hanging	1
on	1
his	1
embroidered	1
collar	1
and	1
new	1
boots	1
obviously	1
put	1
on	1
for	1
the	1
occasion	1
with	1
heels	1
that	1
tapped	1
energetically	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
Casting	1
a	1
displeased	1
glance	1
at	1
Levin	1
this	1
gentleman	1
sharply	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
dirty	1
business	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
denying	1
a	1
small	1
gentleman	1
assented	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
voice	1
Next	1
a	1
whole	1
crowd	1
of	1
country	1
gentlemen	1
surrounding	1
a	1
stout	1
general	1
hurriedly	1
came	1
near	1
Levin	1
These	1
persons	1
were	1
unmistakably	1
seeking	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
talk	1
without	1
being	1
overheard	1
How	1
dare	1
he	1
say	1
I	1
had	1
his	1
breeches	1
stolen	1
Pawned	1
them	1
for	1
drink	1
I	1
expect	1
Damn	1
the	1
fellow	1
prince	1
indeed	1
He	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
the	1
beast	1
But	1
excuse	1
me	1
They	1
take	1
their	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
act	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
in	1
another	1
group	1
the	1
wife	1
must	1
be	1
registered	1
as	1
noble	1
Oh	1
damn	1
your	1
acts	1
I	1
speak	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
We	1
re	1
all	1
gentlemen	1
aren	1
t	1
we	1
Above	1
suspicion	1
Shall	1
we	1
go	1
on	1
your	1
excellency	1
fine	1
champagne	1
	1
Another	1
group	1
was	1
following	1
a	1
nobleman	1
who	1
was	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
intoxicated	1
gentlemen	1
I	1
always	1
advised	1
Marya	1
Semyonovna	1
to	1
let	1
for	1
a	1
fair	1
rent	1
for	1
she	1
can	1
never	1
save	1
a	1
profit	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
pleasant	1
voice	1
say	1
The	1
speaker	1
was	1
a	1
country	1
gentleman	1
with	1
gray	1
whiskers	1
wearing	1
the	1
regimental	1
uniform	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
general	1
staff	1
officer	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
landowner	1
Levin	1
had	1
met	1
at	1
Sviazhsky	1
s	1
He	1
knew	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
The	1
landowner	1
too	1
stared	1
at	1
Levin	1
and	1
they	1
exchanged	1
greetings	1
Very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
remember	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
Last	1
year	1
at	1
our	1
district	1
marshal	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
Well	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
land	1
doing	1
asked	1
Levin	1
Oh	1
still	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
always	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
the	1
landowner	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
resigned	1
smile	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
serenity	1
and	1
conviction	1
that	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
our	1
province	1
he	1
asked	1
Come	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
our	1
coup	1
d	1
'etat	1
	1
he	1
said	1
confidently	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
French	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
bad	1
accent	1
All	1
Russia	1
s	1
here	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
and	1
everything	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
ministry	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
imposing	1
figure	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
in	1
white	1
trousers	1
and	1
his	1
court	1
uniform	1
walking	1
by	1
with	1
a	1
general	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
own	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
very	1
well	1
understand	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
the	1
provincial	1
elections	1
said	1
Levin	1
The	1
landowner	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
understand	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
meaning	1
in	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
decaying	1
institution	1
that	1
goes	1
on	1
running	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
inertia	1
Just	1
look	1
the	1
very	1
uniforms	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
permanent	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
noblemen	1
Then	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
asked	1
Levin	1
From	1
habit	1
nothing	1
else	1
Then	1
too	1
one	1
must	1
keep	1
up	1
connections	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
moral	1
obligation	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
And	1
then	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
there	1
s	1
one	1
s	1
own	1
interests	1
My	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
wants	1
to	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
permanent	1
member	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
rich	1
people	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
forward	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
now	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
come	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
talking	1
at	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
new	1
generation	1
of	1
nobility	1
New	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
nobility	1
it	1
isn	1
t	1
They	1
re	1
proprietors	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
but	1
we	1
re	1
the	1
landowners	1
As	1
noblemen	1
they	1
re	1
cutting	1
their	1
own	1
throats	1
But	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
institution	1
that	1
s	1
served	1
its	1
time	1
That	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
respectfully	1
Snetkov	1
now	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
or	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
but	1
we	1
re	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
If	1
we	1
re	1
laying	1
out	1
a	1
garden	1
planning	1
one	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
there	1
you	1
ve	1
a	1
tree	1
that	1
s	1
stood	1
for	1
centuries	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
spot	1
Old	1
and	1
gnarled	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
old	1
fellow	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
flowerbeds	1
but	1
lay	1
out	1
your	1
beds	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
You	1
won	1
t	1
grow	1
him	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
he	1
said	1
cautiously	1
and	1
he	1
immediately	1
changed	1
the	1
conversation	1
Well	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
land	1
doing	1
Oh	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
I	1
make	1
five	1
per	1
cent	1
Yes	1
but	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
reckon	1
your	1
own	1
work	1
Aren	1
t	1
you	1
worth	1
something	1
too	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
own	1
case	1
Before	1
I	1
took	1
to	1
seeing	1
after	1
the	1
land	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
salary	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
from	1
the	1
service	1
Now	1
I	1
do	1
more	1
work	1
than	1
I	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
like	1
you	1
I	1
get	1
five	1
per	1
cent	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
thank	1
God	1
for	1
that	1
But	1
one	1
s	1
work	1
is	1
thrown	1
in	1
for	1
nothing	1
Then	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
clear	1
loss	1
Oh	1
well	1
one	1
does	1
it	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
It	1
s	1
habit	1
and	1
one	1
knows	1
it	1
s	1
how	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
And	1
what	1
s	1
more	1
the	1
landowner	1
went	1
on	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
chatting	1
on	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
has	1
no	1
taste	1
for	1
it	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
a	1
scientific	1
man	1
So	1
there	1
ll	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
And	1
yet	1
one	1
does	1
it	1
Here	1
this	1
year	1
I	1
ve	1
planted	1
an	1
orchard	1
Yes	1
yes	1
said	1
Levin	1
that	1
s	1
perfectly	1
true	1
I	1
always	1
feel	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
real	1
balance	1
of	1
gain	1
in	1
my	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
yet	1
one	1
does	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
duty	1
one	1
feels	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
the	1
landowner	1
pursued	1
a	1
neighbor	1
of	1
mine	1
a	1
merchant	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
place	1
We	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
the	1
garden	1
No	1
said	1
he	1
Stepan	1
Vassilievitch	1
everything	1
s	1
well	1
looked	1
after	1
but	1
your	1
garden	1
s	1
neglected	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
it	1
s	1
well	1
kept	1
up	1
To	1
my	1
thinking	1
I	1
d	1
cut	1
down	1
that	1
lime	1
tree	1
Here	1
you	1
ve	1
thousands	1
of	1
limes	1
and	1
each	1
would	1
make	1
two	1
good	1
bundles	1
of	1
bark	1
And	1
nowadays	1
that	1
bark	1
s	1
worth	1
something	1
I	1
d	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
lot	1
And	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
made	1
he	1
d	1
increase	1
his	1
stock	1
or	1
buy	1
some	1
land	1
for	1
a	1
trifle	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
lots	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
Levin	1
added	1
smiling	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
come	1
across	1
those	1
commercial	1
calculations	1
And	1
he	1
d	1
make	1
his	1
fortune	1
But	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
thank	1
God	1
if	1
we	1
keep	1
what	1
we	1
ve	1
got	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
our	1
children	1
You	1
re	1
married	1
I	1
ve	1
heard	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
Yes	1
Levin	1
answered	1
with	1
proud	1
satisfaction	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
rather	1
strange	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
So	1
we	1
live	1
without	1
making	1
anything	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
were	1
ancient	1
vestals	1
set	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
a	1
fire	1
The	1
landowner	1
chuckled	1
under	1
his	1
white	1
mustaches	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
among	1
us	1
too	1
like	1
our	1
friend	1
Nikolay	1
Ivanovitch	1
or	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
that	1
s	1
settled	1
here	1
lately	1
who	1
try	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
their	1
husbandry	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
factory	1
but	1
so	1
far	1
it	1
leads	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
making	1
away	1
with	1
capital	1
on	1
it	1
But	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
do	1
like	1
the	1
merchants	1
Why	1
don	1
t	1
we	1
cut	1
down	1
our	1
parks	1
for	1
timber	1
said	1
Levin	1
returning	1
to	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
Why	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
Besides	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
nobleman	1
And	1
our	1
work	1
as	1
noblemen	1
isn	1
t	1
done	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
but	1
yonder	1
each	1
in	1
our	1
corner	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
class	1
instinct	1
too	1
of	1
what	1
one	1
ought	1
and	1
oughtn	1
t	1
to	1
do	1
There	1
s	1
the	1
peasants	1
too	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
them	1
sometimes	1
any	1
good	1
peasant	1
tries	1
to	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
he	1
can	1
However	1
bad	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
he	1
ll	1
work	1
it	1
Without	1
a	1
return	1
too	1
At	1
a	1
simple	1
loss	1
Just	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
said	1
Levin	1
Very	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
met	1
you	1
he	1
added	1
seeing	1
Sviazhsky	1
approaching	1
him	1
And	1
here	1
we	1
ve	1
met	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
we	1
met	1
at	1
your	1
place	1
said	1
the	1
landowner	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
we	1
ve	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
talk	1
too	1
Well	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
attacking	1
the	1
new	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
That	1
we	1
re	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
You	1
ve	1
relieved	1
your	1
feelings	1
Chapter	1
30	1
Sviazhsky	1
took	1
Levin	1
s	1
arm	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
friends	1
This	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
avoiding	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
Levin	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
Delighted	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
ve	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
meeting	1
you	1
at	1
Princess	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
s	1
he	1
said	1
giving	1
Levin	1
his	1
hand	1
Yes	1
I	1
quite	1
remember	1
our	1
meeting	1
said	1
Levin	1
and	1
blushing	1
crimson	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
immediately	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
smile	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
to	1
Sviazhsky	1
obviously	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
inclination	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
Levin	1
But	1
Levin	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
continually	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
gloss	1
over	1
his	1
rudeness	1
What	1
are	1
we	1
waiting	1
for	1
now	1
asked	1
Levin	1
looking	1
at	1
Sviazhsky	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
For	1
Snetkov	1
He	1
has	1
to	1
refuse	1
or	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
stand	1
answered	1
Sviazhsky	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
he	1
done	1
consented	1
or	1
not	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
point	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
done	1
neither	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
refuses	1
who	1
will	1
stand	1
then	1
asked	1
Levin	1
looking	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
Whoever	1
chooses	1
to	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
Shall	1
you	1
asked	1
Levin	1
Certainly	1
not	1
I	1
said	1
Sviazhsky	1
looking	1
confused	1
and	1
turning	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Who	1
then	1
Nevyedovsky	1
said	1
Levin	1
feeling	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
his	1
foot	1
into	1
it	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
worse	1
still	1
Nevyedovsky	1
and	1
Sviazhsky	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
candidates	1
I	1
certainly	1
shall	1
not	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
answered	1
the	1
malignant	1
gentleman	1
This	1
was	1
Nevyedovsky	1
himself	1
Sviazhsky	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
Levin	1
Well	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
exciting	1
too	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
winking	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
It	1
s	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
race	1
One	1
might	1
bet	1
on	1
it	1
Yes	1
it	1
is	1
keenly	1
exciting	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
And	1
once	1
taking	1
the	1
thing	1
up	1
one	1
s	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
through	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
fight	1
he	1
said	1
scowling	1
and	1
setting	1
his	1
powerful	1
jaws	1
What	1
a	1
capable	1
fellow	1
Sviazhsky	1
is	1
Sees	1
it	1
all	1
so	1
clearly	1
Oh	1
yes	1
Vronsky	1
assented	1
indifferently	1
A	1
silence	1
followed	1
during	1
which	1
Vronsky	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
something	1
looked	1
at	1
Levin	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
at	1
his	1
uniform	1
then	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
noticing	1
his	1
gloomy	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
living	1
constantly	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
one	1
It	1
s	1
because	1
I	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
is	1
a	1
silly	1
institution	1
Levin	1
answered	1
gloomily	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
looking	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
smooth	1
over	1
his	1
rudeness	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
meeting	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
so	1
quite	1
the	1
contrary	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
with	1
quiet	1
surprise	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
plaything	1
Levin	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
We	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
I	1
ve	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
single	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
during	1
eight	1
years	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
was	1
decided	1
wrongly	1
by	1
them	1
The	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
is	1
over	1
thirty	1
miles	1
from	1
me	1
For	1
some	1
matter	1
of	1
two	1
roubles	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
lawyer	1
who	1
costs	1
me	1
fifteen	1
And	1
he	1
related	1
how	1
a	1
peasant	1
had	1
stolen	1
some	1
flour	1
from	1
the	1
miller	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
miller	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
lodged	1
a	1
complaint	1
for	1
slander	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
utterly	1
uncalled	1
for	1
and	1
stupid	1
and	1
Levin	1
felt	1
it	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
Oh	1
this	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
original	1
fellow	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
his	1
most	1
soothing	1
almond	1
oil	1
smile	1
But	1
come	1
along	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
re	1
voting	1
And	1
they	1
separated	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
observed	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
clumsiness	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
understand	1
how	1
anyone	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
absolutely	1
devoid	1
of	1
political	1
tact	1
That	1
s	1
where	1
we	1
Russians	1
are	1
so	1
deficient	1
The	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
is	1
our	1
opponent	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
you	1
re	1
ami	1
cochon	1
and	1
you	1
beg	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
making	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
but	1
he	1
s	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
side	1
why	1
make	1
an	1
enemy	1
of	1
him	1
Then	1
you	1
ask	1
Nevyedovsky	1
if	1
he	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
stand	1
That	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
such	1
nonsense	1
Levin	1
answered	1
gloomily	1
You	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
such	1
nonsense	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
muddle	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
The	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
vaguely	1
conscious	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
some	1
trap	1
being	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
by	1
all	1
to	1
stand	1
had	1
still	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
stand	1
All	1
was	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
The	1
secretary	1
announced	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
Mihail	1
Stepanovitch	1
Snetkov	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
balloted	1
for	1
as	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
The	1
district	1
marshals	1
walked	1
carrying	1
plates	1
on	1
which	1
were	1
balls	1
from	1
their	1
tables	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
election	1
began	1
Put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
whispered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
Levin	1
followed	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
his	1
district	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
But	1
Levin	1
had	1
forgotten	1
by	1
now	1
the	1
calculations	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
might	1
be	1
mistaken	1
in	1
saying	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
Surely	1
Snetkov	1
was	1
the	1
enemy	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
but	1
thinking	1
he	1
was	1
wrong	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
he	1
changed	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
undoubtedly	1
put	1
the	1
ball	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
An	1
adept	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
seeing	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
elbow	1
where	1
each	1
put	1
his	1
ball	1
scowled	1
with	1
annoyance	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
insight	1
Everything	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
the	1
counting	1
of	1
the	1
balls	1
was	1
heard	1
Then	1
a	1
single	1
voice	1
rose	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
the	1
numbers	1
for	1
and	1
against	1
The	1
marshal	1
had	1
been	1
voted	1
for	1
by	1
a	1
considerable	1
majority	1
All	1
was	1
noise	1
and	1
eager	1
movement	1
towards	1
the	1
doors	1
Snetkov	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
the	1
nobles	1
thronged	1
round	1
him	1
congratulating	1
him	1
Well	1
now	1
is	1
it	1
over	1
Levin	1
asked	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
It	1
s	1
only	1
just	1
beginning	1
Sviazhsky	1
said	1
replying	1
for	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Some	1
other	1
candidate	1
may	1
receive	1
more	1
votes	1
than	1
the	1
marshal	1
Levin	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
about	1
that	1
Now	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
remember	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
trickery	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
bored	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
exactly	1
He	1
felt	1
depressed	1
and	1
longed	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
As	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
paying	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
apparently	1
needed	1
him	1
he	1
quietly	1
slipped	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
refreshments	1
were	1
and	1
again	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
waiters	1
The	1
little	1
old	1
waiter	1
pressed	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
and	1
Levin	1
agreed	1
After	1
eating	1
a	1
cutlet	1
with	1
beans	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
waiters	1
of	1
their	1
former	1
masters	1
Levin	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
distasteful	1
to	1
him	1
proceeded	1
to	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
galleries	1
The	1
galleries	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
fashionably	1
dressed	1
ladies	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
balustrade	1
and	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
below	1
With	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
sitting	1
and	1
standing	1
smart	1
lawyers	1
high	1
school	1
teachers	1
in	1
spectacles	1
and	1
officers	1
Everywhere	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
election	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
worried	1
the	1
marshal	1
was	1
and	1
how	1
splendid	1
the	1
discussions	1
had	1
been	1
In	1
one	1
group	1
Levin	1
heard	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
praises	1
One	1
lady	1
was	1
telling	1
a	1
lawyer	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
heard	1
Koznishev	1
It	1
s	1
worth	1
losing	1
one	1
s	1
dinner	1
He	1
s	1
exquisite	1
So	1
clear	1
and	1
distinct	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
There	1
s	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
courts	1
that	1
speaks	1
like	1
that	1
The	1
only	1
one	1
is	1
Meidel	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
so	1
eloquent	1
by	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
Finding	1
a	1
free	1
place	1
Levin	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
balustrade	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
and	1
listening	1
All	1
the	1
noblemen	1
were	1
sitting	1
railed	1
off	1
behind	1
barriers	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
districts	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
uniform	1
who	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
high	1
voice	1
As	1
a	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
marshalship	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
we	1
call	1
upon	1
staff	1
captain	1
Yevgeney	1
Ivanovitch	1
Apuhtin	1
A	1
dead	1
silence	1
followed	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
weak	1
old	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
Declined	1
We	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
privy	1
councilor	1
Pyotr	1
Petrovitch	1
Bol	1
the	1
voice	1
began	1
again	1
Declined	1
a	1
high	1
boyish	1
voice	1
replied	1
Again	1
it	1
began	1
and	1
again	1
Declined	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
went	1
on	1
for	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
Levin	1
with	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
balustrade	1
looked	1
and	1
listened	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
wondered	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
then	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
Then	1
recalling	1
all	1
the	1
excitement	1
and	1
vindictiveness	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
faces	1
he	1
felt	1
sad	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
went	1
downstairs	1
As	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
entry	1
to	1
the	1
galleries	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
dejected	1
high	1
school	1
boy	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
tired	1
looking	1
eyes	1
On	1
the	1
stairs	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
couple	1
a	1
lady	1
running	1
quickly	1
on	1
her	1
high	1
heels	1
and	1
the	1
jaunty	1
deputy	1
prosecutor	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
you	1
weren	1
t	1
late	1
the	1
deputy	1

was	1
saying	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Levin	1
moved	1
aside	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
lady	1
pass	1
Levin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
pocket	1
for	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
overcoat	1
when	1
the	1
secretary	1
overtook	1
him	1
This	1
way	1
please	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
they	1
are	1
voting	1
The	1
candidate	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
voted	1
on	1
was	1
Nevyedovsky	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
stoutly	1
denied	1
all	1
idea	1
of	1
standing	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
locked	1
The	1
secretary	1
knocked	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
two	1
red	1
faced	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
darted	1
out	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
stand	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
one	1
red	1
faced	1
gentleman	1
After	1
them	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
was	1
poked	1
out	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
dreadful	1
looking	1
from	1
exhaustion	1
and	1
dismay	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
anyone	1
out	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
doorkeeper	1
I	1
let	1
someone	1
in	1
your	1
excellency	1
Mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
sigh	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
walked	1
with	1
downcast	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
his	1
legs	1
staggering	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
trousers	1
Nevyedovsky	1
had	1
scored	1
a	1
higher	1
majority	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
planned	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
new	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Many	1
people	1
were	1
amused	1
many	1
were	1
pleased	1
and	1
happy	1
many	1
were	1
in	1
ecstasies	1
many	1
were	1
disgusted	1
and	1
unhappy	1
The	1
former	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
despair	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
When	1
Nevyedovsky	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
the	1
crowd	1
thronged	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
followed	1
him	1
enthusiastically	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
governor	1
who	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
meetings	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
followed	1
Snetkov	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
elected	1
Chapter	1
31	1
The	1
newly	1
elected	1
marshal	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
successful	1
party	1
dined	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
elections	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
bored	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
Anna	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
independence	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
repay	1
Sviazhsky	1
by	1
his	1
support	1
at	1
the	1
election	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
the	1
district	1
council	1
election	1
but	1
chiefly	1
in	1
order	1
strictly	1
to	1
perform	1
all	1
those	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
nobleman	1
and	1
landowner	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
upon	1
himself	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
election	1
would	1
so	1
interest	1
him	1
so	1
keenly	1
excite	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
at	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
thing	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
nobility	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
but	1
his	1
success	1
was	1
unmistakable	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
wrong	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
obtained	1
a	1
certain	1
influence	1
This	1
influence	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
reputation	1
the	1
capital	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
lent	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
Shirkov	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
department	1
of	1
finances	1
and	1
was	1
director	1
of	1
a	1
flourishing	1
bank	1
in	1
Kashin	1
the	1
excellent	1
cook	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
his	1
friendship	1
with	1
the	1
governor	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
schoolfellow	1
of	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
a	1
schoolfellow	1
he	1
had	1
patronized	1
and	1
protected	1
indeed	1
But	1
what	1
contributed	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
to	1
his	1
success	1
was	1
his	1
direct	1
equable	1
manner	1
with	1
everyone	1
which	1
very	1
quickly	1
made	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
noblemen	1
reverse	1
the	1
current	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
supposed	1
haughtiness	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
conscious	1
that	1
except	1
that	1
whimsical	1
gentleman	1
married	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Shtcherbatskaya	1
who	1
had	1
`a	1
propos	1
de	1
bottes	1
poured	1
out	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
irrelevant	1
absurdities	1
with	1
such	1
spiteful	1
fury	1
every	1
nobleman	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
become	1
his	1
adherent	1
He	1
saw	1
clearly	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
recognized	1
it	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
Nevyedovsky	1
And	1
now	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
table	1
celebrating	1
Nevyedovsky	1
s	1
election	1
he	1
was	1
experiencing	1
an	1
agreeable	1
sense	1
of	1
triumph	1
over	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
candidate	1
The	1
election	1
itself	1
had	1
so	1
fascinated	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
succeed	1
in	1
getting	1
married	1
during	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
standing	1
himself	1
much	1
as	1
after	1
winning	1
a	1
race	1
ridden	1
by	1
a	1
jockey	1
he	1
had	1
longed	1
to	1
ride	1
a	1
race	1
himself	1
Today	1
he	1
was	1
celebrating	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
jockey	1
Vronsky	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
sat	1
the	1
young	1
governor	1
a	1
general	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
To	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
who	1
had	1
solemnly	1
opened	1
the	1
elections	1
with	1
his	1
speech	1
and	1
aroused	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
awe	1
in	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
Katka	1
Maslov	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
nickname	1
in	1
the	1
Pages	1
Corps	1
whom	1
he	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
shy	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
mettre	1
`a	1
son	1
aise	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
sat	1
Nevyedovsky	1
with	1
his	1
youthful	1
stubborn	1
and	1
malignant	1
face	1
With	1
him	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
simple	1
and	1
deferential	1
Sviazhsky	1
took	1
his	1
failure	1
very	1
light	1
heartedly	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
no	1
failure	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
himself	1
turning	1
glass	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
Nevyedovsky	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
better	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
movement	1
which	1
the	1
nobility	1
ought	1
to	1
follow	1
And	1
so	1
every	1
honest	1
person	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
today	1
s	1
success	1
and	1
was	1
rejoicing	1
over	1
it	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
glad	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
time	1
and	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
pleased	1
The	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
elections	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
occasion	1
for	1
a	1
capital	1
dinner	1
Sviazhsky	1
comically	1
imitated	1
the	1
tearful	1
discourse	1
of	1
the	1
marshal	1
and	1
observed	1
addressing	1
Nevyedovsky	1
that	1
his	1
excellency	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
select	1
another	1
more	1
complicated	1
method	1
of	1
auditing	1
the	1
accounts	1
than	1
tears	1
Another	1
nobleman	1
jocosely	1
described	1
how	1
footmen	1
in	1
stockings	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
for	1
the	1
marshal	1
s	1
ball	1
and	1
how	1
now	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
back	1
unless	1
the	1
new	1
marshal	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
ball	1
with	1
footmen	1
in	1
stockings	1
Continually	1
during	1
dinner	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
Nevyedovsky	1
our	1
marshal	1
and	1
your	1
excellency	1
This	1
was	1
said	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
pleasure	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
bride	1
is	1
called	1
Madame	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
name	1
Nevyedovsky	1
affected	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
merely	1
indifferent	1
but	1
scornful	1
of	1
this	1
appellation	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
highly	1
delighted	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
curb	1
on	1
himself	1
not	1
to	1
betray	1
the	1
triumph	1
which	1
was	1
unsuitable	1
to	1
their	1
new	1
liberal	1
tone	1
After	1
dinner	1
several	1
telegrams	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
people	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
election	1
And	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
good	1
humor	1
sent	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
a	1
telegram	1
Nevyedovsky	1
elected	1
by	1
twenty	1
votes	1
Congratulations	1
Tell	1
people	1
He	1
dictated	1
it	1
aloud	1
saying	1
We	1
must	1
let	1
them	1
share	1
our	1
rejoicing	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
getting	1
the	1
message	1
simply	1
sighed	1
over	1
the	1
rouble	1
wasted	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
after	1
dinner	1
affair	1
She	1
knew	1
Stiva	1
had	1
a	1
weakness	1
after	1
dining	1
for	1
faire	1
jouer	1
le	1
t'el'egraphe	1
	1
Everything	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
excellent	1
dinner	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
not	1
from	1
Russian	1
merchants	1
but	1
imported	1
direct	1
from	1
abroad	1
was	1
extremely	1
dignified	1
simple	1
and	1
enjoyable	1
The	1
party	1
some	1
twenty	1
had	1
been	1
selected	1
by	1
Sviazhsky	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
more	1
active	1
new	1
liberals	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
of	1
thinking	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
clever	1
and	1
well	1
bred	1
They	1
drank	1
also	1
half	1
in	1
jest	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
director	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
amiable	1
host	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
satisfied	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
so	1
pleasant	1
a	1
tone	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
dinner	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
lively	1
The	1
governor	1
asked	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
concert	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
Servians	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
been	1
getting	1
up	1
There	1
ll	1
be	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
the	1
belle	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
Worth	1
seeing	1
really	1
Not	1
in	1
my	1
line	1
Vronsky	1
answered	1
He	1
liked	1
that	1
English	1
phrase	1
But	1
he	1
smiled	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
Before	1
they	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
when	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
smoking	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
valet	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
From	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
by	1
special	1
messenger	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
expression	1
Astonishing	1
how	1
like	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
deputy	1
prosecutor	1
Sventitsky	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
in	1
French	1
of	1
the	1
valet	1
while	1
Vronsky	1
frowning	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
from	1
Anna	1
Before	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
knew	1
its	1
contents	1
Expecting	1
the	1
elections	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
in	1
five	1
days	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
on	1
Friday	1
Today	1
was	1
Saturday	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
letter	1
contained	1
reproaches	1
for	1
not	1
being	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
fixed	1
The	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
previous	1
evening	1
had	1
probably	1
not	1
reached	1
her	1
yet	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
but	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
unexpected	1
and	1
particularly	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him	1

I	1
am	1
sending	1

out	1
where	1
you	1
are	1

are	1

I	1
wanted	1
to	1

myself	1
but	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
knowing	1
you	1
would	1
dislike	1
it	1

over	1

election	1
and	1
this	1
gloomy	1
burdensome	1
love	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
return	1
struck	1
Vronsky	1
by	1
their	1
contrast	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
train	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
home	1
Chapter	1
32	1
Before	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
elections	1
Anna	1
had	1
reflected	1
that	1
the	1
scenes	1
constantly	1
repeated	1
between	1
them	1
each	1
time	1
he	1
left	1
home	1
might	1
only	1
make	1
him	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
attaching	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
parting	1
with	1
composure	1
But	1
the	1
cold	1
severe	1
glance	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
had	1
wounded	1
her	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
was	1
destroyed	1
In	1
solitude	1
afterwards	1
thinking	1
over	1
that	1
glance	1
which	1
had	1
expressed	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
freedom	1
she	1
came	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
humiliation	1
He	1
has	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
chooses	1
Not	1
simply	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
but	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
He	1
has	1
every	1
right	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
none	1
But	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
What	1
has	1
he	1
done	1
though	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
severe	1
expression	1
Of	1
course	1
that	1
is	1
something	1
indefinable	1
impalpable	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
glance	1
means	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
she	1
thought	1
That	1
glance	1
shows	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
indifference	1
And	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
a	1
coldness	1
was	1
beginning	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
alter	1
her	1
relations	1
to	1
him	1
Just	1
as	1
before	1
only	1
by	1
love	1
and	1
by	1
charm	1
could	1
she	1
keep	1
him	1
And	1
so	1
just	1
as	1
before	1
only	1
by	1
occupation	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
by	1
morphine	1
at	1
night	1
could	1
she	1
stifle	1
the	1
fearful	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
one	1
means	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
for	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
love	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
nearer	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
That	1
means	1
was	1
divorce	1
and	1
marriage	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
long	1
for	1
that	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
or	1
Stiva	1
approached	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
Absorbed	1
in	1
such	1
thoughts	1
she	1
passed	1
five	1
days	1
without	1
him	1
the	1
five	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
elections	1
Walks	1
conversation	1
with	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
hospital	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
reading	1
reading	1
of	1
one	1
book	1
after	1
another	1
filled	1
up	1
her	1
time	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
coachman	1
came	1
back	1
without	1
him	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
utterly	1
incapable	1
of	1
stifling	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
there	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
her	1
little	1
girl	1
was	1
taken	1
ill	1
Anna	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
her	1
but	1
even	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
distract	1
her	1
mind	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
illness	1
was	1
not	1
serious	1
However	1
hard	1
she	1
tried	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
this	1
little	1
child	1
and	1
to	1
feign	1
love	1
was	1
beyond	1
her	1
powers	1
Towards	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
still	1
alone	1
Anna	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
panic	1
about	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
decided	1
to	1
start	1
for	1
the	1
town	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
wrote	1
him	1
the	1
contradictory	1
letter	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
received	1
and	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
through	1
sent	1
it	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
she	1
received	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
regretted	1
her	1
own	1
She	1
dreaded	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
severe	1
look	1
he	1
had	1
flung	1
at	1
her	1
at	1
parting	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
not	1
dangerously	1
ill	1
But	1
still	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
Anna	1
was	1
positively	1
admitting	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
relinquish	1
his	1
freedom	1
regretfully	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
glad	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
Let	1
him	1
weary	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
here	1
with	1
her	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
see	1
him	1
would	1
know	1
of	1
every	1
action	1
he	1
took	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
near	1
a	1
lamp	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
volume	1
of	1
Taine	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
outside	1
and	1
every	1
minute	1
expecting	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
arrive	1
Several	1
times	1
she	1
had	1
fancied	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
but	1
the	1
coachman	1
s	1
shout	1
and	1
the	1
dull	1
rumble	1
in	1
the	1
covered	1
entry	1
Even	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
playing	1
patience	1
confirmed	1
this	1
and	1
Anna	1
flushing	1
hotly	1
got	1
up	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
down	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
twice	1
before	1
she	1
stood	1
still	1
She	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
duplicity	1
but	1
even	1
more	1
she	1
dreaded	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
her	1
All	1
feeling	1
of	1
wounded	1
pride	1
had	1
passed	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
displeasure	1
She	1
remembered	1
that	1
her	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
perfectly	1
well	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days	1
She	1
felt	1
positively	1
vexed	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
getting	1
better	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
her	1
letter	1
was	1
sent	1
off	1
Then	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
all	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
his	1
eyes	1
She	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
And	1
forgetting	1
everything	1
she	1
ran	1
joyfully	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
Well	1
how	1
is	1
Annie	1
he	1
said	1
timidly	1
from	1
below	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
pulling	1
off	1
his	1
warm	1
over	1
boot	1
Oh	1
she	1
is	1
better	1
And	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
shaking	1
himself	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
both	1
of	1
hers	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
waist	1
never	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
him	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
he	1
said	1
coldly	1
scanning	1
her	1
her	1
hair	1
her	1
dress	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
for	1
him	1
All	1
was	1
charming	1
but	1
how	1
many	1
times	1
it	1
had	1
charmed	1
him	1
And	1
the	1
stern	1
stony	1
expression	1
that	1
she	1
so	1
dreaded	1
settled	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
And	1
are	1
you	1
well	1
he	1
said	1
wiping	1
his	1
damp	1
beard	1
with	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
Never	1
mind	1
she	1
thought	1
only	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
here	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
s	1
here	1
he	1
cannot	1
he	1
dare	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
me	1
The	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
happily	1
and	1
gaily	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
who	1
complained	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Anna	1
had	1
been	1
taking	1
morphine	1
in	1
his	1
absence	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
sleep	1
My	1
thoughts	1
prevented	1
me	1
When	1
he	1
s	1
here	1
I	1
never	1
take	1
it	1
hardly	1
ever	1
He	1
told	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
election	1
and	1
Anna	1
knew	1
how	1
by	1
adroit	1
questions	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
gave	1
him	1
most	1
pleasure	1
his	1
own	1
success	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
cheerful	1
description	1
But	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
Anna	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
regained	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
him	1
wanted	1
to	1
erase	1
the	1
painful	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
glance	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
letter	1
She	1
said	1
Tell	1
me	1
frankly	1
you	1
were	1
vexed	1
at	1
getting	1
my	1
letter	1
and	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
believe	1
me	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
however	1
warm	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
forgiven	1
her	1
for	1
that	1
Yes	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
First	1
Annie	1
ill	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
thought	1
of	1
coming	1
yourself	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
truth	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
doubt	1
it	1
Yes	1
you	1
do	1
doubt	1
it	1
You	1
are	1
vexed	1
I	1
see	1
Not	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
I	1
m	1
only	1
vexed	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
seem	1
somehow	1
unwilling	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
duties	1
The	1
duty	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
concert	1
But	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
Why	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
only	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
matters	1
of	1
real	1
importance	1
may	1
turn	1
up	1
Now	1
for	1
instance	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow	1
to	1
arrange	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
Oh	1
Anna	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
irritable	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
without	1
you	1
If	1
so	1
said	1
Anna	1
her	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
changing	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sick	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
Yes	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
as	1
men	1
do	1
Anna	1
that	1
s	1
cruel	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
him	1
If	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
Moscow	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
too	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
stay	1
here	1
Either	1
we	1
must	1
separate	1
or	1
else	1
live	1
together	1
Why	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
s	1
my	1
one	1
desire	1
But	1
for	1
that	1
We	1
must	1
get	1
a	1
divorce	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
Moscow	1
You	1
talk	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
threatening	1
me	1
But	1
I	1
desire	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
you	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
there	1
gleamed	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
cold	1
look	1
but	1
the	1
vindictive	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
persecuted	1
and	1
made	1
cruel	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
look	1
and	1
correctly	1
divined	1
its	1
meaning	1
If	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
calamity	1
that	1
glance	1
told	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
impression	1
but	1
she	1
never	1
forgot	1
it	1
Anna	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
asking	1
him	1
about	1
a	1
divorce	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
November	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
Moscow	1
Expecting	1
every	1
day	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
divorce	1
they	1
now	1
established	1
themselves	1
together	1
like	1
married	1
people	1
PART	1

Chapter	1
1	1
The	1
Levins	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
Moscow	1
The	1
date	1
had	1
long	1
passed	1
on	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
trustworthy	1
calculations	1
of	1
people	1
learned	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
Kitty	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
confined	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
about	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
her	1
time	1
was	1
any	1
nearer	1
than	1
two	1
months	1
ago	1
The	1

the	1
monthly	1
nurse	1
and	1
Dolly	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1

most	1
of	1
all	1
Levin	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
event	1
without	1
terror	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
impatient	1
and	1
uneasy	1
Kitty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
person	1
who	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
calm	1
and	1
happy	1
She	1
was	1
distinctly	1
conscious	1
now	1
of	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
child	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
actually	1
existing	1
already	1
and	1
she	1
brooded	1
blissfully	1
over	1
this	1
feeling	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
by	1
now	1
altogether	1
a	1
part	1
of	1

own	1
life	1
independently	1
of	1
her	1
Often	1
this	1
separate	1
being	1
gave	1
her	1
pain	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
laugh	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
new	1
joy	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
she	1
loved	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
attentively	1
caring	1
for	1
her	1
so	1
entirely	1
pleasant	1
was	1
everything	1
presented	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
all	1
soon	1
be	1
over	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
wished	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
pleasanter	1
life	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
spoiled	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
this	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
not	1
here	1
as	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
She	1
liked	1
his	1
serene	1
friendly	1
and	1
hospitable	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
In	1
the	1
town	1
he	1
seemed	1
continually	1
uneasy	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
guard	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
someone	1
would	1
be	1
rude	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
her	1
At	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
knowing	1
himself	1
distinctly	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
place	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
elsewhere	1
He	1
was	1
never	1
unoccupied	1
Here	1
in	1
town	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
continual	1
hurry	1
as	1
though	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
something	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
And	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
To	1
others	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
pity	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
when	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
society	1
as	1
one	1
sometimes	1
looks	1
at	1
those	1
one	1
loves	1
trying	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
stranger	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
on	1
others	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
a	1
panic	1
even	1
of	1
jealous	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
indeed	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
pitiable	1
figure	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
with	1
his	1
fine	1
breeding	1
his	1
rather	1
old	1
fashioned	1
reserved	1
courtesy	1
with	1
women	1
his	1
powerful	1
figure	1
and	1
striking	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
expressive	1
face	1
But	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
from	1
without	1
but	1
from	1
within	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
himself	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
she	1
could	1
define	1
his	1
condition	1
to	1
herself	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
inwardly	1
reproached	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
inability	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
sometimes	1
she	1
recognized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
order	1
his	1
life	1
here	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
it	1
What	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
do	1
indeed	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
cards	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
club	1
Spending	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
jovial	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
type	1
she	1
knew	1
now	1
what	1
that	1
meant	1
it	1
meant	1
drinking	1
and	1
going	1
somewhere	1
after	1
drinking	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
horror	1
of	1
where	1
men	1
went	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
Was	1
he	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
society	1
But	1
she	1
knew	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
find	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
took	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
young	1
women	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
Should	1
he	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
with	1
her	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
But	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
liked	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
their	1
conversations	1
forever	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subjects	1
Aline	1
Nadine	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
called	1
the	1
sisters	1
talks	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
must	1
bore	1
him	1
What	1
was	1
there	1
left	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
To	1
go	1
on	1
writing	1
at	1
his	1
book	1
he	1
had	1
indeed	1
attempted	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
and	1
make	1
extracts	1
and	1
look	1
up	1
references	1
for	1
his	1
book	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
the	1
less	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
And	1
besides	1
he	1
complained	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
too	1
much	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
here	1
and	1
that	1
consequently	1
all	1
his	1
ideas	1
about	1
it	1
were	1
muddled	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
One	1
advantage	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
life	1
was	1
that	1
quarrels	1
hardly	1
ever	1
happened	1
between	1
them	1
here	1
in	1
town	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
their	1
conditions	1
were	1
different	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
become	1
more	1
careful	1
and	1
sensible	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
quarrels	1
in	1
Moscow	1
from	1
jealousy	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
dreaded	1
when	1
they	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
One	1
event	1
an	1
event	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
both	1
from	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
did	1
indeed	1
happen	1
that	1
was	1
Kitty	1
s	1
meeting	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
The	1
old	1
Princess	1
Marya	1
Borissovna	1
Kitty	1
s	1
godmother	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
had	1
insisted	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
Kitty	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
society	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
condition	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
venerable	1
old	1
lady	1
and	1
there	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
Kitty	1
could	1
reproach	1
herself	1
for	1
at	1
this	1
meeting	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
she	1
recognized	1
in	1
his	1
civilian	1
dress	1
the	1
features	1
once	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
her	1
her	1
breath	1
failed	1
her	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
vivid	1
blush	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
But	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
Before	1
her	1
father	1
who	1
purposely	1
began	1
talking	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
ready	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
necessary	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
Princess	1
Marya	1
Borissovna	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
everything	1
to	1
the	1
faintest	1
intonation	1
and	1
smile	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
approved	1
by	1
her	1
husband	1
whose	1
unseen	1
presence	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
about	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
She	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
even	1
smiled	1
serenely	1
at	1
his	1
joke	1
about	1
the	1
elections	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
our	1
parliament	1
She	1
had	1
to	1
smile	1
to	1
show	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
joke	1
But	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
immediately	1
to	1
Princess	1
Marya	1
Borissovna	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
then	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
evidently	1
only	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
uncivil	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
saying	1
good	1
bye	1
She	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
saying	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
their	1
meeting	1
Vronsky	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
special	1
warmth	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
the	1
visit	1
during	1
their	1
usual	1
walk	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
herself	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
while	1
keeping	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
all	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
feeling	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
seem	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
and	1
composed	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
flushed	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
when	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
at	1
Princess	1
Marya	1
Borissovna	1
s	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
this	1
but	1
still	1
harder	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
question	1
her	1
but	1
simply	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
you	1
weren	1
t	1
there	1
she	1
said	1
Not	1
that	1
you	1
weren	1
t	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
natural	1
in	1
your	1
presence	1
I	1
am	1
blushing	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
much	1
much	1
more	1
she	1
said	1
blushing	1
till	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
But	1
that	1
you	1
couldn	1
t	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
crack	1
The	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
told	1
Levin	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
herself	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
blushing	1
he	1
was	1
quickly	1
reassured	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
her	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
wanted	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
everything	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
detail	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
second	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
flushing	1
but	1
that	1
afterwards	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
direct	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
her	1
ease	1
as	1
with	1
any	1
chance	1
acquaintance	1
Levin	1
was	1
quite	1
happy	1
again	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
now	1
behave	1
as	1
stupidly	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
the	1
election	1
but	1
would	1
try	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
friendly	1
as	1
possible	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
wretched	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
man	1
almost	1
an	1
enemy	1
whom	1
it	1
s	1
painful	1
to	1
meet	1
said	1
Levin	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1

Go	1
please	1
go	1
then	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Bols	1
Kitty	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
at	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
before	1
going	1
out	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
dining	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
papa	1
put	1
down	1
your	1
name	1
But	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
going	1
to	1
Katavasov	1
answered	1
Levin	1
Why	1
so	1
early	1
He	1
promised	1
to	1
introduce	1
me	1
to	1
Metrov	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
my	1
work	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
distinguished	1
scientific	1
man	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
said	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
wasn	1
t	1
it	1
his	1
article	1
you	1
were	1
praising	1
so	1
Well	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
said	1
Kitty	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
perhaps	1
about	1
my	1
sister	1
s	1
business	1
And	1
the	1
concert	1
she	1
queried	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
go	1
there	1
all	1
alone	1
No	1
do	1
go	1
there	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
new	1
things	1
That	1
interested	1
you	1
so	1
I	1
should	1
certainly	1
go	1
Well	1
anyway	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
home	1
before	1
dinner	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
Put	1
on	1
your	1
frock	1
coat	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
straight	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
Countess	1
Bola	1
But	1
is	1
it	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
Oh	1
absolutely	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
Come	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
You	1
go	1
in	1
sit	1
down	1
talk	1
for	1
five	1
minutes	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
go	1
away	1
Oh	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
I	1
ve	1
got	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
feel	1
positively	1
ashamed	1
It	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
horrible	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
A	1
complete	1
outsider	1
walks	1
in	1
sits	1
down	1
stays	1
on	1
with	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
wastes	1
their	1
time	1
and	1
worries	1
himself	1
and	1
walks	1
away	1
Kitty	1
laughed	1
Why	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
pay	1
calls	1
before	1
you	1
were	1
married	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
Yes	1
I	1
did	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
by	1
Jove	1
I	1
d	1
sooner	1
go	1
two	1
days	1
running	1
without	1
my	1
dinner	1
than	1
pay	1
this	1
call	1
One	1
s	1
so	1
ashamed	1
I	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
that	1
they	1
re	1
annoyed	1
that	1
they	1
re	1
saying	1
What	1
has	1
he	1
come	1
for	1
No	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
I	1
ll	1
answer	1
for	1
that	1
said	1
Kitty	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
Well	1
good	1
bye	1
Do	1
go	1
please	1
He	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
out	1
after	1
kissing	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
when	1
she	1
stopped	1
him	1
Kostya	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
ve	1
only	1
fifty	1
roubles	1
left	1
Oh	1
all	1
right	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
get	1
some	1
How	1
much	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
she	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
No	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
She	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
Let	1
s	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
worries	1
me	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
spend	1
nothing	1
unnecessary	1
but	1
money	1
seems	1
to	1
fly	1
away	1
simply	1
We	1
don	1
t	1
manage	1
well	1
somehow	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
cough	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
That	1
cough	1
she	1
knew	1
well	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
intense	1
dissatisfaction	1
not	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
with	1
himself	1
He	1
certainly	1
was	1
displeased	1
not	1
at	1
so	1
much	1
money	1
being	1
spent	1
but	1
at	1
being	1
reminded	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
knowing	1
something	1
was	1
unsatisfactory	1
wanted	1
to	1
forget	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
Sokolov	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
to	1
borrow	1
an	1
advance	1
on	1
the	1
mill	1
We	1
shall	1
have	1
money	1
enough	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
Yes	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
that	1
altogether	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
all	1
right	1
he	1
repeated	1
Well	1
good	1
bye	1
darling	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
really	1
sorry	1
sometimes	1
that	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
mamma	1
How	1
nice	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
m	1
worrying	1
you	1
all	1
and	1
we	1
re	1
wasting	1
our	1
money	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
Not	1
once	1
since	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
married	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
things	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
are	1
Truly	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
He	1
had	1
said	1
it	1
without	1
thinking	1
simply	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
saw	1
those	1
sweet	1
truthful	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
questioningly	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
repeated	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
I	1
was	1
positively	1
forgetting	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
he	1
remembered	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
them	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
come	1
Will	1
it	1
be	1
soon	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
feel	1
he	1
whispered	1
taking	1
her	1
two	1
hands	1
I	1
have	1
so	1
often	1
thought	1
so	1
that	1
now	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
or	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
frightened	1
She	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
Not	1
the	1
least	1
little	1
bit	1
she	1
said	1
Well	1
if	1
anything	1
happens	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
No	1
nothing	1
will	1
happen	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
on	1
the	1
boulevard	1
with	1
papa	1
We	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
Dolly	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you	1
before	1
dinner	1
Oh	1
yes	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Dolly	1
s	1
position	1
is	1
becoming	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
She	1
s	1
in	1
debt	1
all	1
round	1
she	1
hasn	1
t	1
a	1
penny	1
We	1
were	1
talking	1
yesterday	1
with	1
mamma	1
and	1
Arseny	1
this	1
was	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
husband	1
Lvov	1
and	1
we	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
you	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
Stiva	1
It	1
s	1
really	1
unbearable	1
One	1
can	1
t	1
speak	1
to	1
papa	1
about	1
it	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
and	1
he	1
Why	1
what	1
can	1
we	1
do	1
said	1
Levin	1
You	1
ll	1
be	1
at	1
Arseny	1
s	1
anyway	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
what	1
we	1
decided	1
Oh	1
I	1
agree	1
to	1
everything	1
Arseny	1
thinks	1
beforehand	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
By	1
the	1
way	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
concert	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
with	1
Natalia	1
Well	1
good	1
bye	1
On	1
the	1
steps	1
Levin	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
his	1
old	1
servant	1
Kouzma	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
his	1
marriage	1
and	1
now	1
looked	1
after	1
their	1
household	1
in	1
town	1
Beauty	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
left	1
shaft	1
horse	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
has	1
been	1
badly	1
shod	1
and	1
is	1
quite	1
lame	1
he	1
said	1
What	1
does	1
your	1
honor	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
During	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Levin	1
had	1
used	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
He	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
arrange	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
expenses	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
cheapest	1
way	1
possible	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
their	1
own	1
horses	1
came	1
dearer	1
than	1
hired	1
horses	1
and	1
they	1
still	1
hired	1
too	1
Send	1
for	1
the	1
veterinary	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
bruise	1
And	1
for	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
asked	1
Kouzma	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
by	1
now	1
struck	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
get	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
Moscow	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
powerful	1
horses	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
heavy	1
carriage	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
carriage	1
three	1
miles	1
through	1
the	1
snowy	1
slush	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
standing	1
there	1
four	1
hours	1
paying	1
five	1
roubles	1
every	1
time	1
Now	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
Hire	1
a	1
pair	1
for	1
our	1
carriage	1
from	1
the	1
jobmaster	1
said	1
he	1
Yes	1
sir	1
And	1
so	1
simply	1
and	1
easily	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
facilities	1
of	1
town	1
life	1
Levin	1
settled	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
for	1
so	1
much	1
personal	1
trouble	1
and	1
exertion	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
he	1
called	1
a	1
sledge	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
Nikitsky	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
money	1
but	1
mused	1
on	1
the	1
introduction	1
that	1
awaited	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Petersburg	1
savant	1
a	1
writer	1
on	1
sociology	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
Only	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
expenditure	1
strange	1
to	1
one	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
unproductive	1
but	1
inevitable	1
that	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
But	1
by	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
That	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
happen	1
to	1
drunkards	1
the	1
first	1
glass	1
sticks	1
in	1
the	1
throat	1
the	1
second	1
flies	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
hawk	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
third	1
they	1
re	1
like	1
tiny	1
little	1
birds	1
When	1
Levin	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
first	1
hundred	1
rouble	1
note	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
liveries	1
for	1
his	1
footmen	1
and	1
hall	1
porter	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
reflecting	1
that	1
these	1
liveries	1
were	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
indubitably	1
necessary	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
amazement	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Kitty	1
when	1
he	1
suggested	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
without	1
liveries	1
that	1
these	1
liveries	1
would	1
cost	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
two	1
laborers	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
that	1
is	1
would	1
pay	1
for	1
about	1
three	1
hundred	1
working	1
days	1
from	1
Easter	1
to	1
Ash	1
Wednesday	1
and	1
each	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
hard	1
work	1
from	1
early	1
morning	1
to	1
late	1
evening	1
and	1
that	1
hundred	1
rouble	1
note	1
did	1
stick	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
But	1
the	1
next	1
note	1
changed	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
providing	1
a	1
dinner	1
for	1
their	1
relations	1
that	1
cost	1
twenty	1
eight	1
roubles	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
excite	1
in	1
Levin	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
twenty	1
eight	1
roubles	1
meant	1
nine	1
measures	1
of	1
oats	1
which	1
men	1
would	1
with	1
groans	1
and	1
sweat	1
have	1
reaped	1
and	1
bound	1
and	1
thrashed	1
and	1
winnowed	1
and	1
sifted	1
and	1
sown	1
this	1
next	1
one	1
he	1
parted	1
with	1
more	1
easily	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
notes	1
he	1
changed	1
no	1
longer	1
aroused	1
such	1
reflections	1
and	1
they	1
flew	1
off	1
like	1
little	1
birds	1
Whether	1
the	1
labor	1
devoted	1
to	1
obtaining	1
the	1
money	1
corresponded	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
given	1
by	1
what	1
was	1
bought	1
with	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
consideration	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
dismissed	1
His	1
business	1
calculation	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
price	1
below	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sell	1
certain	1
grain	1
was	1
forgotten	1
too	1
The	1
rye	1
for	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
held	1
out	1
had	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
fifty	1
kopecks	1
a	1
measure	1
cheaper	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
fetching	1
a	1
month	1
ago	1
Even	1
the	1
consideration	1
that	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
expenditure	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
living	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
without	1
debt	1
that	1
even	1
had	1
no	1
force	1
Only	1
one	1
thing	1
was	1
essential	1
to	1
have	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
bank	1
without	1
inquiring	1
where	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
the	1
wherewithal	1
to	1
buy	1
meat	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
And	1
this	1
condition	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
bank	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
bank	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
tell	1
where	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
next	1
installment	1
And	1
this	1
it	1
was	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Kitty	1
had	1
mentioned	1
money	1
had	1
disturbed	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
He	1
drove	1
off	1
thinking	1
of	1
Katavasov	1
and	1
the	1
meeting	1
with	1
Metrov	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
Chapter	1
3	1
Levin	1
had	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
town	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
Professor	1
Katavasov	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
He	1
liked	1
in	1
Katavasov	1
the	1
clearness	1
and	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
conception	1
of	1
life	1
Levin	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
conception	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
his	1
nature	1
Katavasov	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
disconnectedness	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
ideas	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
intellectual	1
discipline	1
but	1
Levin	1
enjoyed	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
clearness	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
untrained	1
ideas	1
and	1
they	1
liked	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
to	1
discuss	1
Levin	1
had	1
read	1
Katavasov	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
liked	1
them	1
On	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
met	1
Levin	1
at	1
a	1
public	1
lecture	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Metrov	1
whose	1
article	1
Levin	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
liked	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
what	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
Levin	1
s	1
work	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
eleven	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
Levin	1
s	1
acquaintance	1
You	1
re	1
positively	1
a	1
reformed	1
character	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
meeting	1
Levin	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
thought	1
Impossible	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
he	1
at	1
the	1
exact	1
time	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
Montenegrins	1
now	1
They	1
re	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
warriors	1
Why	1
what	1
s	1
happened	1
asked	1
Levin	1
Katavasov	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
last	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
from	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
introduced	1
Levin	1
to	1
a	1
short	1
thick	1
set	1
man	1
of	1
pleasant	1
appearance	1
This	1
was	1
Metrov	1
The	1
conversation	1
touched	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
space	1
on	1
politics	1
and	1
on	1
how	1
recent	1
events	1
were	1
looked	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
spheres	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Metrov	1
repeated	1
a	1
saying	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
through	1
a	1
most	1
trustworthy	1
source	1
reported	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
uttered	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
by	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
heard	1
also	1
on	1
excellent	1
authority	1
that	1
the	1
Tsar	1
had	1
said	1
something	1
quite	1
different	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
imagine	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
both	1
sayings	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
uttered	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
on	1
that	1
topic	1
dropped	1
Yes	1
here	1
he	1
s	1
written	1
almost	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
natural	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
specialist	1
but	1
I	1
as	1
a	1
natural	1
science	1
man	1
was	1
pleased	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
taking	1
mankind	1
as	1
something	1
outside	1
biological	1
laws	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
seeing	1
his	1
dependence	1
on	1
his	1
surroundings	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
dependence	1
seeking	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
his	1
development	1
That	1
s	1
very	1
interesting	1
said	1
Metrov	1
What	1
I	1
began	1
precisely	1
was	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
agriculture	1
but	1
studying	1
the	1
chief	1
instrument	1
of	1
agriculture	1
the	1
laborer	1
said	1
Levin	1
reddening	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
coming	1
to	1
quite	1
unexpected	1
results	1
And	1
Levin	1
began	1
carefully	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
feeling	1
his	1
ground	1
to	1
expound	1
his	1
views	1
He	1
knew	1
Metrov	1
had	1
written	1
an	1
article	1
against	1
the	1
generally	1
accepted	1
theory	1
of	1
political	1
economy	1
but	1
to	1
what	1
extent	1
he	1
could	1
reckon	1
on	1
his	1
sympathy	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
new	1
views	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
from	1
the	1
clever	1
and	1
serene	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
man	1
But	1
in	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
special	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
laborer	1
said	1
Metrov	1
in	1
his	1
biological	1
characteristics	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
placed	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
idea	1
underlying	1
this	1
question	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
agree	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
explaining	1
his	1
own	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
laborer	1
has	1
a	1
quite	1
special	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
support	1
this	1
proposition	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
add	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
this	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
vocation	1
to	1
people	1
vast	1
unoccupied	1
expanses	1
in	1
the	1
East	1
One	1
may	1
easily	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
error	1
in	1
basing	1
any	1
conclusion	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
vocation	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
said	1
Metrov	1
interrupting	1
Levin	1
The	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
laborer	1
will	1
always	1
depend	1
on	1
his	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
capital	1
And	1
without	1
letting	1
Levin	1
finish	1
explaining	1
his	1
idea	1
Metrov	1
began	1
expounding	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
special	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
theory	1
In	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
theory	1
lay	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
understand	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
Metrov	1
like	1
other	1
people	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
article	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
current	1
theory	1
of	1
political	1
economy	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasant	1
simply	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
capital	1
wages	1
and	1
rent	1
He	1
would	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
eastern	1
much	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
of	1
Russia	1
rent	1
was	1
as	1
yet	1
nil	1
that	1
for	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
eighty	1
millions	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
peasants	1
wages	1
took	1
the	1
form	1
simply	1
of	1
food	1
provided	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
that	1
capital	1
does	1
not	1
so	1
far	1
exist	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
primitive	1
tools	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
from	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
every	1
laborer	1
though	1
in	1
many	1
points	1
he	1
differed	1
from	1
the	1
economists	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
wage	1
fund	1
which	1
he	1
expounded	1
to	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
listened	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
made	1
objections	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
interrupt	1
Metrov	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
own	1
thought	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
would	1
have	1
rendered	1
further	1
exposition	1
of	1
Metrov	1
s	1
theories	1
superfluous	1
But	1
later	1
on	1
feeling	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
matter	1
so	1
differently	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
never	1
understand	1
one	1
another	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
oppose	1
his	1
statements	1
but	1
simply	1
listened	1
Although	1
what	1
Metrov	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
utterly	1
devoid	1
of	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
yet	1
experienced	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
flattered	1
his	1
vanity	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
learned	1
man	1
should	1
explain	1
his	1
ideas	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
eagerly	1
with	1
such	1
intensity	1
and	1
confidence	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
sometimes	1
with	1
a	1
mere	1
hint	1
referring	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
whole	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
He	1
put	1
this	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
credit	1
unaware	1
that	1
Metrov	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
discussed	1
his	1
theory	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
intimate	1
friends	1
talked	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
special	1
eagerness	1
to	1
every	1
new	1
person	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
anyone	1
of	1
any	1
subject	1
that	1
interested	1
him	1
even	1
if	1
still	1
obscure	1
to	1
himself	1
We	1
are	1
late	1
though	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
directly	1
Metrov	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
discourse	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Amateurs	1
today	1
in	1
commemoration	1
of	1
the	1
jubilee	1
of	1
Svintitch	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Levin	1
s	1
inquiry	1
Pyotr	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
going	1
I	1
ve	1
promised	1
to	1
deliver	1
an	1
address	1
on	1
his	1
labors	1
in	1
zoology	1
Come	1
along	1
with	1
us	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
interesting	1
Yes	1
and	1
indeed	1
it	1
s	1
time	1
to	1
start	1
said	1
Metrov	1
Come	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
from	1
there	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
place	1
I	1
should	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
work	1
Oh	1
no	1
It	1
s	1
no	1
good	1
yet	1
it	1
s	1
unfinished	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
meeting	1
I	1
say	1
friends	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
He	1
has	1
handed	1
in	1
the	1
separate	1
report	1
Katavasov	1
called	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
frock	1
coat	1
And	1
a	1
conversation	1
sprang	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
university	1
question	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
event	1
that	1
winter	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Three	1
old	1
professors	1
in	1
the	1
council	1
had	1
not	1
accepted	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
professors	1
The	1
young	1
ones	1
had	1
registered	1
a	1
separate	1
resolution	1
This	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
some	1
people	1
was	1
monstrous	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
most	1
just	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
the	1
professors	1
were	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
two	1
parties	1
One	1
party	1
to	1
which	1
Katavasov	1
belonged	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
party	1
a	1
scoundrelly	1
betrayal	1
and	1
treachery	1
while	1
the	1
opposite	1
party	1
saw	1
in	1
them	1
childishness	1
and	1
lack	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
authorities	1
Levin	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
university	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
already	1
during	1
his	1
stay	1
in	1
Moscow	1
heard	1
and	1
talked	1
about	1
this	1
matter	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
He	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
buildings	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
university	1
The	1
meeting	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
Round	1
the	1
cloth	1
covered	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
Katavasov	1
and	1
Metrov	1
seated	1
themselves	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
half	1
dozen	1
persons	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
bending	1
close	1
over	1
a	1
manuscript	1
reading	1
something	1
aloud	1
Levin	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
chairs	1
that	1
were	1
standing	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
asked	1
a	1
student	1
sitting	1
near	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
read	1
The	1
student	1
eyeing	1
Levin	1
with	1
displeasure	1
said	1
Biography	1
Though	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
biography	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
listening	1
and	1
learned	1
some	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
facts	1
about	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
distinguished	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
When	1
the	1
reader	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
chairman	1
thanked	1
him	1
and	1
read	1
some	1
verses	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
Ment	1
sent	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
jubilee	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
poet	1
Then	1
Katavasov	1
in	1
his	1
loud	1
ringing	1
voice	1
read	1
his	1
address	1
on	1
the	1
scientific	1
labors	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
jubilee	1
was	1
being	1
kept	1
When	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
finished	1
Levin	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
time	1
before	1
the	1
concert	1
to	1
read	1
Metrov	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
indeed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
care	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
During	1
the	1
reading	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
over	1
their	1
conversation	1
He	1
saw	1
distinctly	1
now	1
that	1
though	1
Metrov	1
s	1
ideas	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
value	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
too	1
and	1
their	1
ideas	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
made	1
clear	1
and	1
lead	1
to	1
something	1
if	1
each	1
worked	1
separately	1
in	1
his	1
chosen	1
path	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
putting	1
their	1
ideas	1
together	1
And	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
refuse	1
Metrov	1
s	1
invitation	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
Metrov	1
introduced	1
Levin	1
to	1
the	1
chairman	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
news	1
Metrov	1
told	1
the	1
chairman	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
Levin	1
and	1
Levin	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
remarks	1
on	1
his	1
news	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
that	1
morning	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
variety	1
he	1
expressed	1
also	1
a	1
new	1
opinion	1
which	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
struck	1
him	1
After	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
turned	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
university	1
question	1
As	1
Levin	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
it	1
all	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
tell	1
Metrov	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sorry	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
his	1
invitation	1
took	1
leave	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
Lvov	1
s	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Lvov	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
Natalia	1
Kitty	1
s	1
sister	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
foreign	1
capitals	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
service	1
During	1
the	1
previous	1
year	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
service	1
not	1
owing	1
to	1
any	1
unpleasantness	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
unpleasantness	1
with	1
anyone	1
and	1
was	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
palace	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
two	1
boys	1
the	1
best	1
education	1
possible	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
striking	1
contrast	1
in	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
views	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Lvov	1
was	1
older	1
than	1
Levin	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
winter	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
great	1
liking	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
Lvov	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
Levin	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
unannounced	1
Lvov	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
belt	1
and	1
in	1
chamois	1
leather	1
shoes	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
pince	1
nez	1
with	1
blue	1
glasses	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
book	1
that	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
reading	1
desk	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
beautiful	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
half	1
burned	1
cigarette	1
daintily	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
His	1
handsome	1
delicate	1
and	1
still	1
youthful	1
looking	1
face	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
curly	1
glistening	1
silvery	1
hair	1
gave	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
aristocratic	1
air	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Levin	1
Capital	1

How	1

Kitty	1
Sit	1
here	1

more	1
comfortable	1
He	1

up	1

up	1

rocking	1
chair	1
Have	1
you	1
read	1
the	1
last	1
circular	1
in	1
the	1
Journal	1
de	1
St	1
P'etersbourg	1
	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
s	1
excellent	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
French	1
accent	1
Levin	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
Katavasov	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
after	1
talking	1
a	1
little	1
about	1
politics	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Metrov	1
and	1
the	1
learned	1
society	1
s	1
meeting	1
To	1
Lvov	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
envy	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
mix	1
in	1
these	1
interesting	1
scientific	1
circles	1
he	1
said	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
he	1
passed	1
as	1
usual	1
into	1
French	1
which	1
was	1
easier	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
true	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
it	1
My	1
official	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
leave	1
me	1
no	1
time	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
own	1
that	1
my	1
education	1
has	1
been	1
too	1
defective	1
That	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
said	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
feeling	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
touched	1
at	1
Lvov	1
s	1
low	1
opinion	1
of	1
himself	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
put	1
on	1
from	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
seem	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
modest	1
but	1
was	1
absolutely	1
sincere	1
Oh	1
yes	1
indeed	1
I	1
feel	1
now	1
how	1
badly	1
educated	1
I	1
am	1
To	1
educate	1
my	1
children	1
I	1
positively	1
have	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
simply	1
to	1
study	1
myself	1
For	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
teachers	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
someone	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
on	1
your	1
land	1
you	1
want	1
laborers	1
and	1
an	1
overseer	1
See	1
what	1
I	1
m	1
reading	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
Buslaev	1
s	1
Grammar	1
on	1
the	1
desk	1
it	1
s	1
expected	1
of	1
Misha	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
difficult	1
Come	1
explain	1
to	1
me	1
Here	1
he	1
says	1
Levin	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
couldn	1
t	1
be	1
understood	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
taught	1
but	1
Lvov	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
him	1
Oh	1
you	1
re	1
laughing	1
at	1
it	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
how	1
when	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
I	1
m	1
always	1
learning	1
the	1
task	1
that	1
lies	1
before	1
me	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
children	1
Well	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
learn	1
said	1
Lvov	1
All	1
I	1
know	1
said	1
Levin	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
better	1
brought	1
up	1
children	1
than	1
yours	1
and	1
I	1
wouldn	1
t	1
wish	1
for	1
children	1
better	1
than	1
yours	1
Lvov	1
visibly	1
tried	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
delight	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
positively	1
radiant	1
with	1
smiles	1
If	1
only	1
they	1
re	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
I	1
desire	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
yet	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
boys	1
who	1
ve	1
been	1
left	1
like	1
mine	1
to	1
run	1
wild	1
abroad	1
You	1
ll	1
catch	1
all	1
that	1
up	1
They	1
re	1
such	1
clever	1
children	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
character	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
learn	1
when	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
children	1
You	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
character	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
imagine	1
how	1
difficult	1
that	1
is	1
You	1
have	1
hardly	1
succeeded	1
in	1
combating	1
one	1
tendency	1
when	1
others	1
crop	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
struggle	1
begins	1
again	1
If	1
one	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
support	1
in	1
religion	1
you	1
remember	1
we	1
talked	1
about	1
that	1
no	1
father	1
could	1
bring	1
children	1
up	1
relying	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
strength	1
alone	1
without	1
that	1
help	1
This	1
subject	1
which	1
always	1
interested	1
Levin	1
was	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
beauty	1
Natalia	1
Alexandrovna	1
dressed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
were	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
unmistakably	1
feeling	1
no	1
regret	1
but	1
a	1
positive	1
pleasure	1
in	1
interrupting	1
this	1
conversation	1
on	1
a	1
topic	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
now	1
weary	1
of	1
it	1
Well	1
how	1
is	1
Kitty	1
I	1
am	1
dining	1
with	1
you	1
today	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
Arseny	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
carriage	1
And	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
began	1
to	1
discuss	1
their	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
As	1
the	1
husband	1
had	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
meet	1
someone	1
on	1
official	1
business	1
while	1
the	1
wife	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
concert	1
and	1
some	1
public	1
meeting	1
of	1
a	1
committee	1
on	1
the	1
Eastern	1
Question	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
consider	1
and	1
settle	1
Levin	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
their	1
plans	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
themselves	1
It	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
Levin	1
should	1
go	1
with	1
Natalia	1
to	1
the	1
concert	1
and	1
the	1
meeting	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
there	1
they	1
should	1
send	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
the	1
office	1
for	1
Arseny	1
and	1
he	1
should	1
call	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
Kitty	1
s	1
or	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
his	1
work	1
he	1
should	1
send	1
the	1
carriage	1
back	1
and	1
Levin	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
He	1
s	1
spoiling	1
me	1
Lvov	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
assures	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
children	1
are	1
splendid	1
when	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
that	1
s	1
bad	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
them	1
Arseny	1
goes	1
to	1
extremes	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
said	1
his	1
wife	1
If	1
you	1
look	1
for	1
perfection	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
satisfied	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
as	1
papa	1
says	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
extreme	1
we	1
were	1
kept	1
in	1
the	1
basement	1
while	1
our	1
parents	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
rooms	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
the	1
parents	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wash	1
house	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
rooms	1
Parents	1
now	1
are	1
not	1
expected	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
to	1
exist	1
altogether	1
for	1
their	1
children	1
Well	1
what	1
if	1
they	1
like	1
it	1
better	1
Lvov	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
beautiful	1
smile	1
touching	1
her	1
hand	1
Anyone	1
who	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
you	1
would	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
stepmother	1
not	1
a	1
true	1
mother	1
No	1
extremes	1
are	1
not	1
good	1
in	1
anything	1
Natalia	1
said	1
serenely	1
putting	1
his	1
paper	1
knife	1
straight	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
Well	1
come	1
here	1
you	1
perfect	1
children	1
Lvov	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
handsome	1
boys	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
after	1
bowing	1
to	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
obviously	1
wishing	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
about	1
something	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
but	1
Natalia	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
Lvov	1
s	1
colleague	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
Mahotin	1
walked	1
in	1
wearing	1
his	1
court	1
uniform	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
someone	1
and	1
a	1
conversation	1
was	1
kept	1
up	1
without	1
a	1
break	1
upon	1
Herzegovina	1
Princess	1
Korzinskaya	1
the	1
town	1
council	1
and	1
the	1
sudden	1
death	1
of	1
Madame	1
Apraksina	1
Levin	1
even	1
forgot	1
the	1
commission	1
intrusted	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
recollected	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
Oh	1
Kitty	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
about	1
Oblonsky	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
Lvov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
seeing	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
Levin	1
off	1
Yes	1
yes	1
maman	1
wants	1
us	1
les	1
beaux	1
fr`eres	1
	1
to	1
attack	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
blushing	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
Well	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
attack	1
him	1
said	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
standing	1
in	1
her	1
white	1
sheepskin	1
cape	1
waiting	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
Come	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
Chapter	1
5	1
At	1
the	1
concert	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
things	1
were	1
performed	1
One	1
was	1
a	1
fantasia	1
King	1
Lear	1
	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
quartette	1
dedicated	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Bach	1
Both	1
were	1
new	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
style	1
and	1
Levin	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
them	1
After	1
escorting	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
her	1
stall	1
he	1
stood	1
against	1
a	1
column	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
listen	1
as	1
attentively	1
and	1
conscientiously	1
as	1
possible	1
He	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
attention	1
be	1
distracted	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
his	1
impression	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
conductor	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
tie	1
waving	1
his	1
arms	1
which	1
always	1
disturbed	1
his	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
music	1
so	1
much	1
or	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
bonnets	1
with	1
strings	1
carefully	1
tied	1
over	1
their	1
ears	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
either	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
thinking	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
except	1
the	1
music	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
avoid	1
meeting	1
musical	1
connoisseurs	1
or	1
talkative	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
floor	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
listening	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
fantasia	1
of	1
King	1
Lear	1
the	1
further	1
he	1
felt	1
from	1
forming	1
any	1
definite	1
opinion	1
of	1
it	1
There	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
continual	1
beginning	1
a	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
musical	1
expression	1
of	1
some	1
feeling	1
but	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
pieces	1
again	1
directly	1
breaking	1
into	1
new	1
musical	1
motives	1
or	1
simply	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
whims	1
of	1
the	1
composer	1
exceedingly	1
complex	1
but	1
disconnected	1
sounds	1
And	1
these	1
fragmentary	1
musical	1
expressions	1
though	1
sometimes	1
beautiful	1
were	1
disagreeable	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
utterly	1
unexpected	1
and	1
not	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
by	1
anything	1
Gaiety	1
and	1
grief	1
and	1
despair	1
and	1
tenderness	1
and	1
triumph	1
followed	1
one	1
another	1
without	1
any	1
connection	1
like	1
the	1
emotions	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
And	1
those	1
emotions	1
like	1
a	1
madman	1
s	1
sprang	1
up	1
quite	1
unexpectedly	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
performance	1
Levin	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
deaf	1
man	1
watching	1
people	1
dancing	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
complete	1
bewilderment	1
when	1
the	1
fantasia	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
great	1
weariness	1
from	1
the	1
fruitless	1
strain	1
on	1
his	1
attention	1
Loud	1
applause	1
resounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
Everyone	1
got	1
up	1
moved	1
about	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
Anxious	1
to	1
throw	1
some	1
light	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
perplexity	1
from	1
the	1
impressions	1
of	1
others	1
Levin	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
looking	1
for	1
connoisseurs	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
musical	1
amateur	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
Pestsov	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
Marvelous	1
Pestsov	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
his	1
mellow	1
bass	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Particularly	1
sculpturesque	1
and	1
plastic	1
so	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
richly	1
colored	1
is	1
that	1
passage	1
where	1
you	1
feel	1
Cordelia	1
s	1
approach	1
where	1
woman	1
das	1
ewig	1
Weibliche	1
	1
enters	1
into	1
conflict	1
with	1
fate	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
You	1
mean	1
what	1
has	1
Cordelia	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
Levin	1
asked	1
timidly	1
forgetting	1
that	1
the	1
fantasia	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
represent	1
King	1
Lear	1
Cordelia	1
comes	1
in	1
see	1
here	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
tapping	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
satiny	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
program	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
passing	1
it	1
to	1
Levin	1
Only	1
then	1
Levin	1
recollected	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
fantasia	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
translation	1
the	1
lines	1
from	1
Shakespeare	1
that	1
were	1
printed	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
program	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
follow	1
it	1
without	1
that	1
said	1
Pestsov	1
addressing	1
Levin	1
as	1
the	1
person	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
to	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
In	1
the	1
entr	1
acte	1
Levin	1
and	1
Pestsov	1
fell	1
into	1
an	1
argument	1
upon	1
the	1
merits	1
and	1
defects	1
of	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
Wagner	1
school	1
Levin	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
mistake	1
of	1
Wagner	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
followers	1
lay	1
in	1
their	1
trying	1
to	1
take	1
music	1
into	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
another	1
art	1
just	1
as	1
poetry	1
goes	1
wrong	1
when	1
it	1
tries	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
painting	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
this	1
mistake	1
he	1
cited	1
the	1
sculptor	1
who	1
carved	1
in	1
marble	1
certain	1
poetic	1
phantasms	1
flitting	1
round	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
on	1
the	1
pedestal	1
These	1
phantoms	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
phantoms	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
positively	1
clinging	1
on	1
the	1
ladder	1
said	1
Levin	1
The	1
comparison	1
pleased	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
used	1
the	1
same	1
phrase	1
before	1
and	1
to	1
Pestsov	1
too	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
confused	1
Pestsov	1
maintained	1
that	1
art	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
attain	1
its	1
highest	1
manifestations	1
only	1
by	1
conjunction	1
with	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
art	1
The	1
second	1
piece	1
that	1
was	1
performed	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
Pestsov	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
him	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
condemning	1
the	1
music	1
for	1
its	1
excessive	1
affected	1
assumption	1
of	1
simplicity	1
and	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
Pre	1
Raphaelites	1
in	1
painting	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
Levin	1
met	1
many	1
more	1
acquaintances	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
politics	1
of	1
music	1
and	1
of	1
common	1
acquaintances	1
Among	1
others	1
he	1
met	1
Count	1
Bol	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
utterly	1
forgotten	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
Well	1
go	1
at	1
once	1
then	1
Madame	1
Lvova	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
perhaps	1
they	1
ll	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
meeting	1
to	1
fetch	1
me	1
You	1
ll	1
find	1
me	1
still	1
there	1
Chapter	1
6	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
re	1
not	1
at	1
home	1
said	1
Levin	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
Countess	1
Bola	1
s	1
house	1
At	1
home	1
please	1
walk	1
in	1
said	1
the	1
porter	1
resolutely	1
removing	1
his	1
overcoat	1
How	1
annoying	1
thought	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
taking	1
off	1
one	1
glove	1
and	1
stroking	1
his	1
hat	1
What	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
for	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
As	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
first	1
drawing	1
room	1
Levin	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
Countess	1
Bola	1
giving	1
some	1
order	1
to	1
a	1
servant	1
with	1
a	1
care	1
worn	1
and	1
severe	1
face	1
On	1
seeing	1
Levin	1
she	1
smiled	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
heard	1
voices	1
In	1
this	1
room	1
there	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
armchairs	1
the	1
two	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
a	1
Moscow	1
colonel	1
whom	1
Levin	1
knew	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
greeted	1
them	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
How	1
is	1
your	1
wife	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
concert	1
We	1
couldn	1
t	1
go	1
Mamma	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
funeral	1
service	1
Yes	1
I	1
heard	1
What	1
a	1
sudden	1
death	1
said	1
Levin	1
The	1
countess	1
came	1
in	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
asked	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
inquired	1
about	1
the	1
concert	1
Levin	1
answered	1
and	1
repeated	1
an	1
inquiry	1
about	1
Madame	1
Apraksina	1
s	1
sudden	1
death	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
weak	1
health	1
Were	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
opera	1
yesterday	1
Yes	1
I	1
was	1
Lucca	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
Yes	1
very	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
repeating	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
about	1
the	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
singer	1
s	1
talent	1
Countess	1
Bola	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
listening	1
Then	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
enough	1
and	1
paused	1
the	1
colonel	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
till	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
The	1
colonel	1
too	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
opera	1
and	1
about	1
culture	1
At	1
last	1
after	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
folle	1
journ'ee	1
at	1
Turin	1
s	1
the	1
colonel	1
laughed	1
got	1
up	1
noisily	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
Levin	1
too	1
rose	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
time	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
He	1
must	1
stay	1
two	1
minutes	1
longer	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
how	1
stupid	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
conversation	1
and	1
sat	1
silent	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
meeting	1
They	1
say	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
interesting	1
began	1
the	1
countess	1
No	1
I	1
promised	1
my	1
belle	1
soeur	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
from	1
it	1
said	1
Levin	1
A	1
silence	1
followed	1
The	1
mother	1
once	1
more	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
a	1
daughter	1
Well	1
now	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
thought	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
The	1
ladies	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
mille	1
choses	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
them	1
The	1
porter	1
asked	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
coat	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
honor	1
staying	1
and	1
immediately	1
wrote	1
down	1
his	1
address	1
in	1
a	1
big	1
handsomely	1
bound	1
book	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
and	1
awfully	1
stupid	1
thought	1
Levin	1
consoling	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
everyone	1
does	1
it	1
He	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
meeting	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
drive	1
home	1
with	1
her	1
At	1
the	1
public	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
people	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
highest	1
society	1
Levin	1
was	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
as	1
everyone	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
When	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
report	1
was	1
over	1
people	1
moved	1
about	1
and	1
Levin	1
met	1
Sviazhsky	1
who	1
invited	1
him	1
very	1
pressingly	1
to	1
come	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Agriculture	1
where	1
a	1
celebrated	1
lecture	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
races	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
Levin	1
heard	1
and	1
uttered	1
various	1
criticisms	1
on	1
the	1
meeting	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
fantasia	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
public	1
trial	1
But	1
probably	1
from	1
the	1
mental	1
fatigue	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
blunder	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
and	1
this	1
blunder	1
he	1
recalled	1
several	1
times	1
with	1
vexation	1
Speaking	1
of	1
the	1
sentence	1
upon	1
a	1
foreigner	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
condemned	1
in	1
Russia	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
unfair	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
by	1
exile	1
abroad	1
Levin	1
repeated	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
conversation	1
from	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
I	1
think	1
sending	1
him	1
abroad	1
is	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
punishing	1
a	1
carp	1
by	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
said	1
Levin	1
Then	1
he	1
recollected	1
that	1
this	1
idea	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
uttered	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
fable	1
of	1
Krilov	1
s	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
had	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
newspaper	1
article	1
After	1
driving	1
home	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
finding	1
Kitty	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
and	1
quite	1
well	1
Levin	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Levin	1
reached	1
the	1
club	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
Members	1
and	1
visitors	1
were	1
driving	1
up	1
as	1
he	1
arrived	1
Levin	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
while	1
not	1
since	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
society	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
club	1
the	1
external	1
details	1
of	1
its	1
arrangement	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
the	1
impression	1
it	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
driving	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
semicircular	1
court	1
and	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sledge	1
he	1
mounted	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
adorned	1
with	1
a	1
crossway	1
scarf	1
noiselessly	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
the	1
cloaks	1
and	1
galoshes	1
of	1
members	1
who	1
thought	1
it	1
less	1
trouble	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
off	1
downstairs	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
mysterious	1
ringing	1
bell	1
that	1
preceded	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
ascended	1
the	1
easy	1
carpeted	1
staircase	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
statue	1
on	1
the	1
landing	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
porter	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
doors	1
a	1
familiar	1
figure	1
grown	1
older	1
in	1
the	1
club	1
livery	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
haste	1
or	1
delay	1
and	1
scanning	1
the	1
visitors	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
in	1
Levin	1
felt	1
the	1
old	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
rush	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
repose	1
comfort	1
and	1
propriety	1
Your	1
hat	1
please	1
the	1
porter	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
who	1
forgot	1
the	1
club	1
rule	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
hat	1
in	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
Long	1
time	1
since	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
The	1
prince	1
put	1
your	1
name	1
down	1
yesterday	1
Prince	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
is	1
not	1
here	1
yet	1
The	1
porter	1
did	1
not	1
only	1
know	1
Levin	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
his	1
ties	1
and	1
relationships	1
and	1
so	1
immediately	1
mentioned	1
his	1
intimate	1
friends	1
Passing	1
through	1
the	1
outer	1
hall	1
divided	1
up	1
by	1
screens	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
partitioned	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
where	1
a	1
man	1
sits	1
at	1
the	1
fruit	1
buffet	1
Levin	1
overtook	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
walking	1
slowly	1
in	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
noise	1
and	1
people	1
He	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
tables	1
almost	1
all	1
full	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
visitors	1
He	1
saw	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
some	1
he	1
knew	1
a	1
little	1
some	1
intimate	1
friends	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
cross	1
or	1
worried	1
looking	1
face	1
All	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
left	1
their	1
cares	1
and	1
anxieties	1
in	1
the	1
porter	1
s	1
room	1
with	1
their	1
hats	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
deliberately	1
getting	1
ready	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
material	1
blessings	1
of	1
life	1
Sviazhsky	1
was	1
here	1
and	1
Shtcherbatsky	1
Nevyedovsky	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Ah	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
late	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
smiling	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
shoulder	1
How	1
s	1
Kitty	1
he	1
added	1
smoothing	1
out	1
the	1
napkin	1
he	1
had	1
tucked	1
in	1
at	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
buttons	1
All	1
right	1
they	1
are	1
dining	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
the	1

of	1

Ah	1
Aline	1
Nadine	1
to	1

There	1

Go	1
to	1
that	1
table	1
and	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
he	1
carefully	1
took	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
eel	1
soup	1
Levin	1
this	1
way	1
a	1
good	1
natured	1
voice	1
shouted	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
on	1
It	1
was	1
Turovtsin	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
officer	1
and	1
beside	1
them	1
were	1
two	1
chairs	1
turned	1
upside	1
down	1
Levin	1
gladly	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
liked	1
the	1
good	1
hearted	1
rake	1
Turovtsin	1
he	1
was	1
associated	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
memories	1
of	1
his	1
courtship	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
after	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
intellectual	1
conversation	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Turovtsin	1
s	1
good	1
natured	1
face	1
was	1
particularly	1
welcome	1
For	1
you	1
and	1
Oblonsky	1
He	1
ll	1
be	1
here	1
directly	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
holding	1
himself	1
very	1
erect	1
with	1
eyes	1
forever	1
twinkling	1
with	1
enjoyment	1
was	1
an	1
officer	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
Gagin	1
Turovtsin	1
introduced	1
them	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
always	1
late	1
Ah	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
Have	1
you	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
coming	1
quickly	1
towards	1
them	1
Good	1
day	1
Had	1
some	1
vodka	1
Well	1
come	1
along	1
then	1
Levin	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
table	1
spread	1
with	1
spirits	1
and	1
appetizers	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
various	1
kinds	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
two	1
dozen	1
delicacies	1
one	1
might	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
one	1
s	1
taste	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
asked	1
for	1
something	1
special	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
liveried	1
waiters	1
standing	1
by	1
immediately	1
brought	1
what	1
was	1
required	1
They	1
drank	1
a	1
wine	1
glassful	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
table	1
At	1
once	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
soup	1
Gagin	1
was	1
served	1
with	1
champagne	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
waiter	1
to	1
fill	1
four	1
glasses	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
refuse	1
the	1
wine	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
bottle	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
hungry	1
and	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
with	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
with	1
still	1
greater	1
enjoyment	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
lively	1
and	1
simple	1
conversation	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
Gagin	1
dropping	1
his	1
voice	1
told	1
the	1
last	1
good	1
story	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
the	1
story	1
though	1
improper	1
and	1
stupid	1
was	1
so	1
ludicrous	1
that	1
Levin	1
broke	1
into	1
roars	1
of	1
laughter	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
those	1
near	1
looked	1
round	1
That	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
as	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
endure	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
story	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Ah	1
that	1
s	1
exquisite	1
Another	1
bottle	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
waiter	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
relate	1
his	1
good	1
story	1
Pyotr	1
Illyitch	1
Vinovsky	1
invites	1
you	1
to	1
drink	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
waiter	1
interrupted	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
bringing	1
two	1
delicate	1
glasses	1
of	1
sparkling	1
champagne	1
and	1
addressing	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
Levin	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
and	1
looking	1
towards	1
a	1
bald	1
man	1
with	1
red	1
mustaches	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
smiling	1
Who	1
s	1
that	1
asked	1
Levin	1
You	1
met	1
him	1
once	1
at	1
my	1
place	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
remember	1
A	1
good	1
natured	1
fellow	1
Levin	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
glass	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
anecdote	1
too	1
was	1
very	1
amusing	1
Levin	1
told	1
his	1
story	1
and	1
that	1
too	1
was	1
successful	1
Then	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
horses	1
of	1
the	1
races	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
smartly	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
Atlas	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
first	1
prize	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
how	1
the	1
time	1
passed	1
at	1
dinner	1
Ah	1
and	1
here	1
they	1
are	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
dinner	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
tall	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
too	1
beamed	1
with	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
good	1
humored	1
enjoyment	1
that	1
was	1
general	1
in	1
the	1
club	1
He	1
propped	1
his	1
elbow	1
playfully	1
on	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
shoulder	1
whispering	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Levin	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
good	1
humored	1
smile	1
Very	1
glad	1
to	1
meet	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
looked	1
out	1
for	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
election	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
you	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
Yes	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
We	1
ve	1
just	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
your	1
horse	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
said	1
Levin	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
rapidly	1
run	1
Yes	1
you	1
ve	1
race	1
horses	1
too	1
haven	1
t	1
you	1
No	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
but	1
I	1
remember	1
and	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
it	1
Where	1
have	1
you	1
dined	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
We	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
table	1
behind	1
the	1
columns	1
We	1
ve	1
been	1
celebrating	1
his	1
success	1
said	1
the	1
tall	1
colonel	1
It	1
s	1
his	1
second	1
Imperial	1
prize	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
luck	1
at	1
cards	1
he	1
has	1
with	1
horses	1
Well	1
why	1
waste	1
the	1
precious	1
time	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
infernal	1
regions	1
added	1
the	1
colonel	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
That	1
s	1
Yashvin	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Turovtsin	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
vacated	1
seat	1
beside	1
them	1
He	1
drank	1
the	1
glass	1
offered	1
him	1
and	1
ordered	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
atmosphere	1
or	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
Levin	1
chatted	1
away	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
breeds	1
of	1
cattle	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
not	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
slightest	1
hostility	1
to	1
this	1
man	1
He	1
even	1
told	1
him	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
at	1
Princess	1
Marya	1
Borissovna	1
s	1
Ah	1
Princess	1
Marya	1
Borissovna	1
she	1
s	1
exquisite	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
an	1
anecdote	1
about	1
her	1
which	1
set	1
them	1
all	1
laughing	1
Vronsky	1
particularly	1
laughed	1
with	1
such	1
simplehearted	1
amusement	1
that	1
Levin	1
felt	1
quite	1
reconciled	1
to	1
him	1
Well	1
have	1
we	1
finished	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
getting	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Getting	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
Levin	1
walked	1
with	1
Gagin	1
through	1
the	1
lofty	1
room	1
to	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
feeling	1
his	1
arms	1
swing	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
peculiar	1
lightness	1
and	1
ease	1
As	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
big	1
room	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
Well	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
our	1
Temple	1
of	1
Indolence	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
taking	1
his	1
arm	1
Come	1
along	1
come	1
along	1
Yes	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
everything	1
It	1
s	1
interesting	1
Yes	1
it	1
s	1
interesting	1
for	1
you	1
But	1
its	1
interest	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
quite	1
different	1
You	1
look	1
at	1
those	1
little	1
old	1
men	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
club	1
member	1
with	1
bent	1
back	1
and	1
projecting	1
lip	1
shuffling	1
towards	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
soft	1
boots	1
and	1
imagine	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
shlupiks	1
like	1
that	1
from	1
their	1
birth	1
up	1
How	1
shlupiks	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
that	1
name	1
That	1
s	1
our	1
club	1
designation	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
rolling	1
eggs	1
when	1
one	1
s	1
rolled	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
it	1
becomes	1
a	1
shlupik	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
one	1
goes	1
on	1
coming	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
and	1
ends	1
by	1
becoming	1
a	1
shlupik	1
Ah	1
you	1
laugh	1
but	1
we	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
dropping	1
into	1
it	1
ourselves	1
You	1
know	1
Prince	1
Tchetchensky	1
inquired	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
Levin	1
saw	1
by	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
relate	1
something	1
funny	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
him	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
Well	1
Prince	1
Tchetchensky	1
is	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
figure	1
No	1
matter	1
though	1
He	1
s	1
always	1
playing	1
billiards	1
here	1
Only	1
three	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
shlupik	1
and	1
kept	1
up	1
his	1
spirits	1
and	1
even	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
other	1
people	1
shlupiks	1
But	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
turns	1
up	1
and	1
our	1
porter	1
you	1
know	1
Vassily	1
Why	1
that	1
fat	1
one	1
he	1
s	1
famous	1
for	1
his	1
bon	1
mots	1
And	1
so	1
Prince	1
Tchetchensky	1
asks	1
him	1
Come	1
Vassily	1
who	1
s	1
here	1
Any	1
shlupiks	1
here	1
yet	1
And	1
he	1
says	1
You	1
re	1
the	1
third	1
Yes	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
Talking	1
and	1
greeting	1
the	1
friends	1
they	1
met	1
Levin	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
walked	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
the	1
great	1
room	1
where	1
tables	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
set	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
partners	1
were	1
playing	1
for	1
small	1
stakes	1
the	1
divan	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
playing	1
chess	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
sitting	1
talking	1
to	1
somebody	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
where	1
about	1
a	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
recess	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lively	1
party	1
drinking	1
champagne	1
Gagin	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
They	1
peeped	1
into	1
the	1
infernal	1
regions	1
where	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
men	1
were	1
crowding	1
round	1
one	1
table	1
at	1
which	1
Yashvin	1
was	1
sitting	1
Trying	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
they	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
reading	1
room	1
where	1
under	1
the	1
shaded	1
lamps	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
wrathful	1
countenance	1
turning	1
over	1
one	1
journal	1
after	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
bald	1
general	1
buried	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
They	1
went	1
too	1
into	1
what	1
the	1
prince	1
called	1
the	1
intellectual	1
room	1
where	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
heated	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
latest	1
political	1
news	1
Prince	1
please	1
come	1
we	1
re	1
ready	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
card	1
party	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
went	1
off	1
Levin	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
listened	1
but	1
recalling	1
all	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
felt	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
fearfully	1
bored	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
Oblonsky	1
and	1
Turovtsin	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
pleasant	1
Turovtsin	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
drinking	1
in	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
talking	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
near	1
the	1
door	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
dull	1
but	1
this	1
undefined	1
this	1
unsettled	1
position	1
Levin	1
caught	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
hurrying	1
away	1
but	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
Levin	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
not	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
exactly	1
but	1
moist	1
which	1
always	1
happened	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
drinking	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
touched	1
Just	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
both	1
causes	1
Levin	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
warmly	1
squeezed	1
his	1
arm	1
above	1
the	1
elbow	1
obviously	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
wishing	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
almost	1
my	1
greatest	1
friend	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
You	1
have	1
become	1
even	1
closer	1
and	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
friends	1
and	1
great	1
friends	1
because	1
you	1
re	1
both	1
splendid	1
fellows	1
Well	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
for	1
us	1
now	1
but	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
be	1
friends	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
with	1
good	1
natured	1
playfulness	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
Levin	1
quickly	1
took	1
the	1
offered	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
it	1
warmly	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
very	1
glad	1
said	1
Levin	1
Waiter	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
champagne	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
And	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
desire	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
desire	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
and	1
both	1
felt	1
it	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
met	1
Anna	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
Vronsky	1
And	1
I	1
want	1
above	1
everything	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1

Vronsky	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
going	1
home	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
added	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
worried	1
about	1
Yashvin	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
stay	1
on	1
till	1
he	1
finishes	1
Why	1
is	1
he	1
losing	1
He	1
keeps	1
losing	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
the	1
only	1
friend	1
that	1
can	1
restrain	1
him	1
Well	1
what	1
do	1

will	1
you	1
play	1

Get	1
the	1
table	1
ready	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
marker	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
ready	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
answered	1
the	1
marker	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
set	1
the	1
balls	1
in	1
a	1
triangle	1
and	1
was	1
knocking	1
the	1
red	1
one	1
about	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
diversion	1
Well	1
let	1
us	1
begin	1
After	1
the	1
game	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Levin	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
Gagin	1
s	1
table	1
and	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1

suggestion	1
Levin	1
took	1
a	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
game	1
Vronsky	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
surrounded	1
by	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
incessantly	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
infernal	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
Yashvin	1
Levin	1
was	1
enjoying	1
a	1
delightful	1
sense	1
of	1
repose	1
after	1
the	1
mental	1
fatigue	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
He	1
was	1
glad	1
that	1
all	1
hostility	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
peace	1
decorum	1
and	1
comfort	1
never	1
left	1
him	1
When	1
the	1
game	1
was	1
over	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
took	1
Levin	1
s	1
arm	1
Well	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Anna	1
s	1
then	1
At	1
once	1
Eh	1
She	1
is	1
at	1
home	1
I	1
promised	1
her	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
Where	1
were	1
you	1
meaning	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
Oh	1
nowhere	1
specially	1
I	1
promised	1
Sviazhsky	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Society	1
of	1
Agriculture	1
By	1
all	1
means	1
let	1
us	1

said	1
Levin	1
Very	1
good	1
come	1
along	1
Find	1
out	1
if	1
my	1

Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
paid	1
the	1
forty	1
roubles	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
paid	1
his	1
bill	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
mysterious	1
way	1
ascertained	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
old	1
waiter	1
who	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
counter	1
and	1
swinging	1
his	1

Chapter	1
9	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
carriage	1
the	1
porter	1
shouted	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
bass	1
The	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up	1
and	1
both	1
got	1
in	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
moments	1
while	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
driving	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
clubhouse	1
gates	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
still	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
club	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
repose	1
comfort	1
and	1
unimpeachable	1
good	1
form	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
jolting	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
road	1
heard	1
the	1
angry	1
shout	1
of	1
a	1
sledge	1
driver	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
uncertain	1
light	1
the	1
red	1
blind	1
of	1
a	1
tavern	1
and	1
the	1
shops	1
this	1
impression	1
was	1
dissipated	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
his	1
actions	1
and	1
to	1
wonder	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
right	1
in	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
What	1
would	1
Kitty	1
say	1
But	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
reflection	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
divining	1
his	1
doubts	1
he	1
scattered	1
them	1
How	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
her	1
You	1
know	1
Dolly	1
has	1
long	1
wished	1
for	1
it	1
And	1
Lvov	1
s	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
often	1
goes	1
Though	1
she	1
is	1
my	1
sister	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
pursued	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
hesitate	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
s	1
a	1
remarkable	1
woman	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
Her	1
position	1
is	1
very	1
painful	1
especially	1
now	1
Why	1
especially	1
now	1
We	1
are	1
carrying	1
on	1
negotiations	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
about	1
a	1
divorce	1
And	1
he	1
s	1
agreed	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
difficulties	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
arranged	1
long	1
ago	1
has	1
been	1
dragging	1
on	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
past	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
divorce	1
is	1
over	1
she	1
will	1
marry	1
Vronsky	1
How	1
stupid	1
these	1
old	1
ceremonies	1
are	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
believes	1
in	1
and	1
which	1
only	1
prevent	1
people	1
being	1
comfortable	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
put	1
in	1
Well	1
then	1
their	1
position	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
regular	1
as	1
mine	1
as	1
yours	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
difficulty	1
said	1
Levin	1
Oh	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
tedious	1
story	1
The	1
whole	1
business	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
anomalous	1
position	1
with	1
us	1
But	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
Moscow	1
where	1
everyone	1
knows	1
her	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
divorce	1
she	1
goes	1
out	1
nowhere	1
sees	1
no	1
woman	1
except	1
Dolly	1
because	1
do	1
you	1
understand	1
she	1
doesn	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
people	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
favor	1
That	1
fool	1
Princess	1
Varvara	1
even	1
she	1
has	1
left	1
her	1
considering	1
this	1
a	1
breach	1
of	1
propriety	1
Well	1
you	1
see	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position	1
any	1
other	1
woman	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
found	1
resources	1
in	1
herself	1
But	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
has	1
arranged	1
her	1
life	1
how	1
calm	1
how	1
dignified	1
she	1
is	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
crescent	1
opposite	1
the	1
church	1
shouted	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
leaning	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
Phew	1
how	1
hot	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
twelve	1
degrees	1
of	1
frost	1
flinging	1
his	1
open	1
overcoat	1
still	1
wider	1
open	1
But	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
daughter	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
s	1
busy	1
looking	1
after	1
her	1
said	1
Levin	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
picture	1
every	1
woman	1
simply	1
as	1
a	1
female	1
une	1
couveuse	1
	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
If	1
she	1
s	1
occupied	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
No	1
she	1
brings	1
her	1
up	1
capitally	1
I	1
believe	1
but	1
one	1
doesn	1
t	1
hear	1
about	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
busy	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
writes	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
re	1
smiling	1
ironically	1
but	1
you	1
re	1
wrong	1
She	1
s	1
writing	1
a	1
children	1
s	1
book	1
and	1
doesn	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
anyone	1
but	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
manuscript	1
to	1
Vorkuev	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
publisher	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
an	1
author	1
himself	1
too	1
I	1
fancy	1
He	1
understands	1
those	1
things	1
and	1
he	1
says	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
remarkable	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
But	1
are	1
you	1
fancying	1
she	1
s	1
an	1
authoress	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
before	1
everything	1
but	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
Now	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
little	1
English	1
girl	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
family	1
she	1
s	1
looking	1
after	1
Oh	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
philanthropic	1
way	1
Why	1
you	1
will	1
look	1
at	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
worst	1
light	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
from	1
philanthropy	1
it	1
s	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
They	1
that	1
is	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
a	1
trainer	1
an	1
Englishman	1
first	1
rate	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
line	1
but	1
a	1
drunkard	1
He	1
s	1
completely	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
drink	1
delirium	1
tremens	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
cast	1
on	1
the	1
world	1
She	1
saw	1
them	1
helped	1
them	1
got	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
is	1
on	1
her	1
hands	1
But	1
not	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
patronage	1
you	1
know	1
helping	1
with	1
money	1
she	1
s	1
herself	1
preparing	1
the	1
boys	1
in	1
Russian	1
for	1
the	1
high	1
school	1
and	1
she	1
s	1
taken	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
her	1
But	1
you	1
ll	1
see	1
her	1
for	1
yourself	1
The	1
carriage	1
drove	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
rang	1
loudly	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
where	1
sledges	1
were	1
standing	1
And	1
without	1
asking	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
whether	1
the	1
lady	1
were	1
at	1
home	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
Levin	1
followed	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
right	1
or	1
wrong	1
Looking	1
at	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
Levin	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
red	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
drunk	1
and	1
he	1
followed	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
up	1
the	1
carpeted	1
stairs	1
At	1
the	1
top	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
bowed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
friend	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
and	1
received	1
the	1
answer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
M	1
Vorkuev	1
Where	1
are	1
they	1
In	1
the	1
study	1
Passing	1
through	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
a	1
room	1
not	1
very	1
large	1
with	1
dark	1
paneled	1
walls	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
Levin	1
walked	1
over	1
the	1
soft	1
carpet	1
to	1
the	1
half	1
dark	1
study	1
lighted	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
lamp	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
dark	1
shade	1
Another	1
lamp	1
with	1
a	1
reflector	1
was	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
lighting	1
up	1
a	1
big	1
full	1
length	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
which	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
looking	1
at	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
Anna	1
painted	1
in	1
Italy	1
by	1
Mihailov	1
While	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
behind	1
the	1
treillage	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
voice	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
paused	1
Levin	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
which	1
stood	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
frame	1
in	1
the	1
brilliant	1
light	1
thrown	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
himself	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
He	1
positively	1
forgot	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
not	1
even	1
hearing	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
marvelous	1
portrait	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
picture	1
but	1
a	1
living	1
charming	1
woman	1
with	1
black	1
curling	1
hair	1
with	1
bare	1
arms	1
and	1
shoulders	1
with	1
a	1
pensive	1
smile	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
covered	1
with	1
soft	1
down	1
triumphantly	1
and	1
softly	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
baffled	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
living	1
only	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
a	1
living	1
woman	1
can	1
be	1
I	1
am	1
delighted	1
He	1
heard	1
suddenly	1
near	1
him	1
a	1
voice	1
unmistakably	1
addressing	1
him	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
admiring	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
Anna	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
treillage	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
Levin	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
very	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
portrait	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
blue	1
shot	1
gown	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
perfection	1
of	1
beauty	1
which	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
She	1
was	1
less	1
dazzling	1
in	1
reality	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
fresh	1
and	1
seductive	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
woman	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
portrait	1
Chapter	1
10	1
She	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
not	1
concealing	1
her	1
pleasure	1
at	1
seeing	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
little	1
vigorous	1
hand	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
Vorkuev	1
and	1
indicated	1
a	1
red	1
haired	1
pretty	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
work	1
calling	1
her	1
her	1
pupil	1
Levin	1
recognized	1
and	1
liked	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
world	1
always	1

am	1
delighted	1
delighted	1
she	1
repeated	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
these	1
simple	1
words	1
took	1
for	1
Levin	1
s	1
ears	1
a	1
special	1
significance	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
and	1
liked	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
both	1
from	1
your	1
friendship	1
with	1
Stiva	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
s	1
sake	1
I	1
knew	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
but	1
she	1
left	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
an	1
exquisite	1
flower	1
simply	1
a	1
flower	1
And	1
to	1
think	1
she	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
a	1
mother	1
She	1
spoke	1
easily	1
and	1
without	1
haste	1
looking	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
from	1
Levin	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
Levin	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
was	1
making	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
immediately	1
at	1
home	1
simple	1
and	1
happy	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
from	1
childhood	1
Ivan	1
Petrovitch	1
and	1
I	1
settled	1
in	1
Alexey	1
s	1
study	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
might	1
smoke	1
just	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
smoke	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
Levin	1
instead	1
of	1
asking	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
smoke	1
she	1
pulled	1
closer	1
a	1
tortoise	1
shell	1
cigar	1
case	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
cigarette	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
feeling	1
today	1
her	1
brother	1
asked	1
her	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
Nerves	1
as	1
usual	1
Yes	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
extraordinarily	1
fine	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
noticing	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
picture	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
better	1
portrait	1
And	1
extraordinarily	1
like	1
isn	1
t	1
it	1
said	1
Vorkuev	1
Levin	1
looked	1
from	1
the	1
portrait	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
A	1
peculiar	1
brilliance	1
lighted	1
up	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
felt	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
Levin	1
flushed	1
and	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
confusion	1
would	1
have	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
lately	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Anna	1
spoke	1
We	1
were	1
just	1
talking	1
Ivan	1
Petrovitch	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Vashtchenkov	1
s	1
last	1
pictures	1
Have	1
you	1
seen	1
them	1
Yes	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
answered	1
Levin	1
But	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
I	1
interrupted	1
you	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
Levin	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Dolly	1
lately	1
She	1
was	1
here	1
yesterday	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
indignant	1
with	1
the	1
high	1
school	1
people	1
on	1
Grisha	1
s	1
account	1
The	1
Latin	1
teacher	1
it	1
seems	1
had	1
been	1
unfair	1
to	1
him	1
Yes	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
pictures	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
them	1
very	1
much	1
Levin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
she	1
had	1
started	1
Levin	1
talked	1
now	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
with	1
that	1
purely	1
businesslike	1
attitude	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
Every	1
word	1
in	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
had	1
a	1
special	1
significance	1
And	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
pleasant	1
still	1
pleasanter	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her	1
Anna	1
talked	1
not	1
merely	1
naturally	1
and	1
cleverly	1
but	1
cleverly	1
and	1
carelessly	1
attaching	1
no	1
value	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
ideas	1
and	1
giving	1
great	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
The	1
conversation	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
movement	1
in	1
art	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
illustrations	1
of	1
the	1
Bible	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
artist	1
Vorkuev	1
attacked	1
the	1
artist	1
for	1
a	1
realism	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coarseness	1
Levin	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
carried	1
conventionality	1
further	1
than	1
anyone	1
and	1
that	1
consequently	1
they	1
see	1
a	1
great	1
merit	1
in	1
the	1
return	1
to	1
realism	1
In	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
not	1
lying	1
they	1
see	1
poetry	1
Never	1
had	1
anything	1
clever	1
said	1
by	1
Levin	1
given	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
pleasure	1
as	1
this	1
remark	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
lighted	1
up	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
appreciated	1
the	1
thought	1
She	1
laughed	1
I	1
laugh	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
one	1
laughs	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
a	1
very	1
true	1
portrait	1
What	1
you	1
said	1
so	1
perfectly	1
hits	1
off	1
French	1
art	1
now	1
painting	1
and	1
literature	1
too	1
indeed	1
Zola	1
Daudet	1
But	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
that	1
men	1
form	1
their	1
conceptions	1
from	1
fictitious	1
conventional	1
types	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
combinaisons	1
made	1
they	1
are	1
tired	1
of	1
the	1
fictitious	1
figures	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
invent	1
more	1
natural	1
true	1
figures	1
That	1
s	1
perfectly	1
true	1
said	1
Vorknev	1
So	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
Yes	1
yes	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
Levin	1
thought	1
forgetting	1
himself	1
and	1
staring	1
persistently	1
at	1
her	1
lovely	1
mobile	1
face	1
which	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
was	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
completely	1
transformed	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
of	1
as	1
she	1
leaned	1
over	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
her	1
expression	1
Her	1
face	1
so	1
handsome	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
in	1
its	1
repose	1
suddenly	1
wore	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
strange	1
curiosity	1
anger	1
and	1
pride	1
But	1
this	1
lasted	1
only	1
an	1
instant	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
eyelids	1
as	1
though	1
recollecting	1
something	1
Oh	1
well	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
of	1
no	1
interest	1
to	1
anyone	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
girl	1
Please	1
order	1
the	1
tea	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
English	1
The	1
girl	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
Well	1
how	1
did	1
she	1
get	1
through	1
her	1
examination	1
asked	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Splendidly	1
She	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
gifted	1
child	1
and	1
a	1
sweet	1
character	1
It	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
your	1
loving	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
your	1
own	1
There	1
a	1
man	1
speaks	1
In	1
love	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
daughter	1
with	1
one	1
love	1
and	1
her	1
with	1
another	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
telling	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
said	1
Vorkuev	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
she	1
devotes	1
to	1
this	1
English	1
girl	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
Russian	1
children	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
doing	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
useful	1
work	1
Yes	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
do	1
it	1
Count	1
Alexey	1
Kirillovitch	1
urged	1
me	1
very	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
Count	1
Alexey	1
Kirillovitch	1
she	1
glanced	1
with	1
appealing	1
timidity	1
at	1
Levin	1
and	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
responded	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
and	1
reassuring	1
look	1
he	1
urged	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
school	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
I	1
visited	1
it	1
several	1
times	1
The	1
children	1
were	1
very	1
nice	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
drawn	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
You	1
speak	1
of	1
energy	1
Energy	1
rests	1
upon	1
love	1
and	1
come	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
forcing	1
it	1
I	1
took	1
to	1
this	1
child	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
myself	1
say	1
why	1
And	1
she	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
Levin	1
And	1
her	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
glance	1
all	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
she	1
was	1
addressing	1
her	1
words	1
valuing	1
his	1
good	1
opinion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
sure	1
beforehand	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1
each	1
other	1
I	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
Levin	1
answered	1
It	1
s	1
impossible	1
to	1
give	1
one	1
s	1
heart	1
to	1
a	1
school	1
or	1
such	1
institutions	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
why	1
philanthropic	1
institutions	1
always	1
give	1
such	1
poor	1
results	1
She	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
then	1
she	1
smiled	1
Yes	1
yes	1
she	1
agreed	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
Je	1
n	1
ai	1
pas	1
le	1
coeur	1
assez	1
large	1
to	1
love	1
a	1
whole	1
asylum	1
of	1
horrid	1
little	1
girls	1
Cela	1
ne	1
m	1
a	1
jamais	1
r'eussi	1
	1
There	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
women	1
who	1
have	1
made	1
themselves	1
une	1
position	1
sociale	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
And	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
mournful	1
confiding	1
expression	1
ostensibly	1
addressing	1
her	1
brother	1
but	1
unmistakably	1
intending	1
her	1
words	1
only	1
for	1
Levin	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
such	1
need	1
of	1
some	1
occupation	1
I	1
cannot	1
And	1
suddenly	1
frowning	1
Levin	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
frowning	1
at	1
herself	1
for	1
talking	1
about	1
herself	1
she	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
a	1
public	1
spirited	1
citizen	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
defended	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
How	1
have	1
you	1
defended	1
me	1
Oh	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
attacks	1
made	1
on	1
you	1
But	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
tea	1
She	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
bound	1
in	1
morocco	1
Give	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
said	1
Vorkuev	1
indicating	1
the	1
book	1
It	1
s	1
well	1
worth	1
taking	1
up	1
Oh	1
no	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
so	1
sketchy	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
nodding	1
at	1
Levin	1
You	1
shouldn	1
t	1
have	1
My	1
writing	1
is	1
something	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
those	1
little	1
baskets	1
and	1
carving	1
which	1
Liza	1
Mertsalova	1
used	1
to	1
sell	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
prisons	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
department	1
in	1
that	1
society	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Levin	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
miracles	1
of	1
patience	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
those	1
poor	1
wretches	1
And	1
Levin	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
trait	1
in	1
this	1
woman	1
who	1
attracted	1
him	1
so	1
extraordinarily	1
Besides	1
wit	1
grace	1
and	1
beauty	1
she	1
had	1
truth	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
hide	1
from	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
As	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
sighed	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
a	1
hard	1
expression	1
looked	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
turned	1
to	1
stone	1
With	1
that	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
ever	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
was	1
new	1
it	1
was	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
that	1
expression	1
radiant	1
with	1
happiness	1
and	1
creating	1
happiness	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
painter	1
in	1
her	1
portrait	1
Levin	1
looked	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
portrait	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
figure	1
as	1
taking	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
arm	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
doors	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
a	1
tenderness	1
and	1
pity	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
wondered	1
himself	1
She	1
asked	1
Levin	1
and	1
Vorkuev	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
while	1
she	1
stayed	1
behind	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
About	1
her	1
divorce	1
about	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
s	1
doing	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
about	1
me	1
wondered	1
Levin	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
keenly	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
that	1
he	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
what	1
Vorkuev	1
was	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
qualities	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
for	1
children	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
had	1
written	1
At	1
tea	1
the	1
same	1
pleasant	1
sort	1
of	1
talk	1
full	1
of	1
interesting	1
matter	1
continued	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
when	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
conversation	1
was	1
to	1
seek	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
hardly	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
one	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
eagerly	1
held	1
back	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
saying	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
her	1
but	1
by	1
Vorkuev	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
all	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
gained	1
peculiar	1
significance	1
from	1
her	1
appreciation	1
and	1
her	1
criticism	1
While	1
he	1
followed	1
this	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
Levin	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
admiring	1
her	1
her	1
beauty	1
her	1
intelligence	1
her	1
culture	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
her	1
directness	1
and	1
genuine	1
depth	1
of	1
feeling	1
He	1
listened	1
and	1
talked	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
inner	1
life	1
trying	1
to	1
divine	1
her	1
feelings	1
And	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
judged	1
her	1
so	1
severely	1
hitherto	1
now	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
chain	1
of	1
reasoning	1
he	1
was	1
justifying	1
her	1
and	1
was	1
also	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
afraid	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
did	1
not	1
fully	1
understand	1
her	1
At	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
Vorkuev	1
had	1
left	1
earlier	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
Regretfully	1
Levin	1
too	1
rose	1
Good	1
bye	1
she	1
said	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
glancing	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
winning	1
look	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
que	1
la	1

	1
She	1
dropped	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
half	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
Tell	1
your	1
wife	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
cannot	1
pardon	1
me	1
my	1
position	1
then	1
my	1
wish	1
for	1
her	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
never	1
pardon	1
it	1
To	1
pardon	1
it	1
one	1
must	1
go	1
through	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
through	1
and	1
may	1
God	1
spare	1
her	1
that	1
Certainly	1
yes	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1

What	1
a	1
marvelous	1
sweet	1
and	1
unhappy	1
woman	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
as	1
he	1
stepped	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
frosty	1
air	1
with	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Well	1
didn	1
t	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
seeing	1
that	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
completely	1
won	1
over	1
Yes	1
said	1
Levin	1
dreamily	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
woman	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
her	1
cleverness	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
such	1
wonderful	1
depth	1
of	1
feeling	1
I	1
m	1
awfully	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
Now	1
please	1
God	1
everything	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1

opening	1
the	1
carriage	1
door	1
Good	1
bye	1
we	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Still	1
thinking	1
of	1
Anna	1
of	1
everything	1
even	1
the	1
simplest	1
phrase	1
in	1
their	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
recalling	1
the	1
minutest	1
changes	1
in	1
her	1
expression	1
entering	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
into	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
feeling	1
sympathy	1
for	1
her	1
Levin	1
reached	1
home	1
At	1
home	1
Kouzma	1
told	1
Levin	1
that	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
sisters	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
been	1
gone	1
and	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
two	1
letters	1
Levin	1
read	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
overlook	1
them	1
later	1
One	1
was	1
from	1
Sokolov	1
his	1
bailiff	1
Sokolov	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
corn	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sold	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
fetching	1
only	1
five	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
roubles	1
and	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
got	1
for	1
it	1
The	1
other	1
letter	1
was	1
from	1
his	1
sister	1
She	1
scolded	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
business	1
being	1
still	1
unsettled	1
Well	1
we	1
must	1
sell	1
it	1
at	1
five	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
more	1
Levin	1
decided	1
the	1
first	1
question	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
before	1
seemed	1
such	1
a	1
weighty	1
one	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
facility	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
It	1
s	1
extraordinary	1
how	1
all	1
one	1
s	1
time	1
is	1
taken	1
up	1
here	1
he	1
thought	1
considering	1
the	1
second	1
letter	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
got	1
done	1
what	1
his	1
sister	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
her	1
Today	1
again	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
but	1
today	1
I	1
ve	1
certainly	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
And	1
resolving	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
Levin	1
rapidly	1
ran	1
through	1
mentally	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
All	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
conversations	1
conversations	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
All	1
the	1
conversations	1
were	1
upon	1
subjects	1
which	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
at	1
home	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
but	1
here	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
interesting	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
conversations	1
were	1
right	1
enough	1
only	1
in	1
two	1
places	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
quite	1
right	1
One	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
carp	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
quite	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
sympathy	1
he	1
was	1
feeling	1
for	1
Anna	1
Levin	1
found	1
his	1
wife	1
low	1
spirited	1
and	1
dull	1
The	1
dinner	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
then	1
they	1
had	1
waited	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
felt	1
dull	1
the	1
sisters	1
had	1
departed	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
alone	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
doing	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
shone	1
with	1
rather	1
a	1
suspicious	1
brightness	1
But	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
telling	1
her	1
everything	1
she	1
concealed	1
her	1
close	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
approving	1
smile	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
felt	1
quite	1
at	1
ease	1
and	1
natural	1
with	1
him	1
You	1
understand	1
I	1
shall	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
that	1
this	1
awkwardness	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
remembering	1
that	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
immediately	1
gone	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
Anna	1
he	1
blushed	1
We	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
peasants	1
drinking	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
which	1
drinks	1
most	1
the	1
peasantry	1
or	1
our	1
own	1
class	1
the	1
peasants	1
do	1
on	1
holidays	1
but	1
But	1
Kitty	1
took	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
interest	1
in	1
discussing	1
the	1
drinking	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
blushed	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
Well	1
and	1
then	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
Stiva	1
urged	1
me	1
awfully	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
Levin	1
blushed	1
even	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
doubts	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
right	1
in	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
Anna	1
were	1
settled	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
He	1
knew	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
Kitty	1
s	1
eyes	1
opened	1
in	1
a	1
curious	1
way	1
and	1
gleamed	1
at	1
Anna	1
s	1
name	1
but	1
controlling	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
effort	1
she	1
concealed	1
her	1
emotion	1
and	1
deceived	1
him	1
Oh	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
m	1
sure	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
angry	1
at	1
my	1
going	1
Stiva	1
begged	1
me	1
to	1
and	1
Dolly	1
wished	1
it	1
Levin	1
went	1
on	1
Oh	1
no	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
a	1
constraint	1
that	1
boded	1
him	1
no	1
good	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
very	1
very	1
unhappy	1
good	1
woman	1
he	1
said	1
telling	1
her	1
about	1
Anna	1
her	1
occupations	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
Yes	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
said	1
Kitty	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
Whom	1
was	1
your	1
letter	1
from	1
He	1
told	1
her	1
and	1
believing	1
in	1
her	1
calm	1
tone	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
coat	1
Coming	1
back	1
he	1
found	1
Kitty	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
easy	1
chair	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
broke	1
into	1
sobs	1
What	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
knowing	1
beforehand	1
what	1
You	1
re	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
hateful	1
woman	1
she	1
has	1
bewitched	1
you	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
Yes	1
yes	1
What	1
can	1
it	1
all	1
lead	1
to	1
You	1
were	1
drinking	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
drinking	1
and	1
gambling	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
No	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
away	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
away	1
tomorrow	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
before	1
Levin	1
could	1
soothe	1
his	1
wife	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
calming	1
her	1
only	1
by	1
confessing	1
that	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
pity	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
succumbed	1
to	1
Anna	1
s	1
artful	1
influence	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
avoid	1
her	1
One	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
more	1
sincerity	1
confess	1
to	1
was	1
that	1
living	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
Moscow	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
conversation	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
he	1
was	1
degenerating	1
They	1
talked	1
till	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Only	1
at	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
were	1
they	1
sufficiently	1
reconciled	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
Chapter	1
12	1
After	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
her	1
guests	1
Anna	1
did	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
but	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
She	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
done	1
her	1
utmost	1
to	1
arouse	1
in	1
Levin	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
love	1
as	1
of	1
late	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
doing	1
with	1
all	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
she	1
had	1
attained	1
her	1
aim	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
possible	1
in	1
one	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
married	1
and	1
conscientious	1
man	1
She	1
liked	1
him	1
indeed	1
extremely	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
striking	1
difference	1
from	1
the	1
masculine	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
between	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Levin	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
she	1
saw	1
something	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
common	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
Kitty	1
able	1
to	1
love	1
both	1
Yet	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
One	1
thought	1
and	1
one	1
only	1
pursued	1
her	1
in	1
different	1
forms	1
and	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
off	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
effect	1
on	1
others	1
on	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
his	1
home	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
cold	1
to	1
me	1
not	1
cold	1
exactly	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
But	1
something	1
new	1
is	1
drawing	1
us	1
apart	1
now	1
Why	1
wasn	1
t	1
he	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
He	1
told	1
Stiva	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
Yashvin	1
and	1
must	1
watch	1
over	1
his	1
play	1
Is	1
Yashvin	1
a	1
child	1
But	1
supposing	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
He	1
never	1
tells	1
a	1
lie	1
But	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
else	1
in	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
He	1
is	1
glad	1
of	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
other	1
duties	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
submit	1
to	1
that	1
But	1
why	1
prove	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
He	1
wants	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
his	1
freedom	1
But	1
I	1
need	1
no	1
proofs	1
I	1
need	1
love	1
He	1
ought	1
to	1
understand	1
all	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
for	1
me	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Is	1
this	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
living	1
but	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
is	1
continually	1
put	1
off	1
and	1
put	1
off	1
No	1
answer	1
again	1
And	1
Stiva	1
says	1
he	1
cannot	1
go	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
write	1
again	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
can	1
begin	1
nothing	1
can	1
alter	1
nothing	1
I	1
hold	1
myself	1
in	1
I	1
wait	1
inventing	1
amusements	1
for	1
myself	1
the	1
English	1
family	1
writing	1

but	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
sham	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
morphine	1
He	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
feeling	1
tears	1
of	1
self	1
pity	1
coming	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
She	1
heard	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
abrupt	1
ring	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
dried	1
her	1
tears	1
not	1
only	1
dried	1
her	1
tears	1
but	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
lamp	1
and	1
opened	1
a	1
book	1
affecting	1
composure	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
displeased	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
home	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
displeased	1
only	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
her	1
distress	1
and	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
self	1
pity	1
She	1
might	1
pity	1
herself	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
pity	1
her	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
strife	1
she	1
blamed	1
him	1
for	1
wanting	1
to	1
quarrel	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
put	1
herself	1
into	1
an	1
attitude	1
of	1
antagonism	1
Well	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
dull	1
he	1
said	1
eagerly	1
and	1
good	1
humoredly	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
What	1
a	1
terrible	1
passion	1
it	1
is	1
gambling	1
No	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
dull	1
I	1
ve	1
learned	1
long	1
ago	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
dull	1
Stiva	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
and	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
Well	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
like	1
Levin	1
he	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
Very	1
much	1
They	1
have	1
not	1
long	1
been	1
gone	1
What	1
was	1
Yashvin	1
doing	1
He	1
was	1
winning	1
seventeen	1
thousand	1
I	1
got	1
him	1
away	1
He	1
had	1
really	1
started	1
home	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
s	1
losing	1
Then	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
stay	1
for	1
she	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
lifting	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
ungracious	1
You	1
told	1
Stiva	1
you	1
were	1
staying	1
on	1
to	1
get	1
Yashvin	1
away	1
And	1
you	1
have	1
left	1
him	1
there	1
The	1
same	1
expression	1
of	1
cold	1
readiness	1
for	1
the	1
conflict	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
too	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
message	1
and	1
secondly	1
I	1
never	1
tell	1
lies	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
the	1
chief	1
point	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
I	1
stayed	1
he	1
said	1
frowning	1
Anna	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
why	1
will	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
bending	1
over	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
hand	1
hoping	1
she	1
would	1
lay	1
hers	1
in	1
it	1
She	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
this	1
appeal	1
for	1
tenderness	1
But	1
some	1
strange	1
force	1
of	1
evil	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
her	1
give	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
feelings	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
warfare	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
her	1
to	1
surrender	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
you	1
stayed	1
You	1
do	1
everything	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
for	1
With	1
what	1
object	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
excited	1
Does	1
anyone	1
contest	1
your	1
rights	1
But	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
welcome	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
His	1
hand	1
closed	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
obstinate	1
expression	1
For	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
obstinacy	1
she	1
said	1
watching	1
him	1
intently	1
and	1
suddenly	1
finding	1
the	1
right	1
word	1
for	1
that	1
expression	1
that	1
irritated	1
her	1
simply	1
obstinacy	1
For	1
you	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
whether	1
you	1
keep	1
the	1
upper	1
hand	1
of	1
me	1
while	1
for	1
me	1
Again	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
almost	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
When	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
hostile	1
yes	1
hostile	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
this	1
means	1
for	1
me	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
how	1
I	1
feel	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
calamity	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
how	1
afraid	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
myself	1
And	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
hiding	1
her	1
sobs	1
But	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about	1
he	1
said	1
horrified	1
at	1
her	1
expression	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
again	1
bending	1
over	1
her	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
Do	1
I	1
seek	1
amusements	1
outside	1
our	1
home	1
Don	1
t	1
I	1
avoid	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
women	1
Well	1
yes	1
If	1
that	1
were	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
happy	1
he	1
said	1
touched	1
by	1
her	1
expression	1
of	1
despair	1
what	1
wouldn	1
t	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
save	1
you	1
from	1
distress	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
as	1
now	1
Anna	1
he	1
said	1
It	1
s	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
myself	1
whether	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
solitary	1
life	1
my	1
nerves	1
Come	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
What	1
about	1
the	1
race	1
You	1
haven	1
t	1
told	1
me	1
she	1
inquired	1
trying	1
to	1
conceal	1
her	1
triumph	1
at	1
the	1
victory	1
which	1
had	1
anyway	1
been	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
He	1
asked	1
for	1
supper	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
races	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
tone	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
which	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
cold	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
forgive	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
victory	1
that	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
obstinacy	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
struggling	1
had	1
asserted	1
itself	1
again	1
in	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
colder	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
before	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
regretting	1
his	1
surrender	1
And	1
she	1
remembering	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
the	1
victory	1
how	1
I	1
feel	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
calamity	1
how	1
afraid	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
myself	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
weapon	1
was	1
a	1
dangerous	1
one	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
used	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
And	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
beside	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
bound	1
them	1
together	1
there	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
between	1
them	1
some	1
evil	1
spirit	1
of	1
strife	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
exorcise	1
from	1
his	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
Chapter	1
13	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
conditions	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
become	1
used	1
especially	1
if	1
he	1
sees	1
that	1
all	1
around	1
him	1
are	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
three	1
months	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
gone	1
quietly	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
leading	1
an	1
aimless	1
irrational	1
life	1
living	1
too	1
beyond	1
his	1
means	1
after	1
drinking	1
to	1
excess	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
call	1
what	1
happened	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
anything	1
else	1
forming	1
inappropriately	1
friendly	1
relations	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
whom	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
inappropriate	1
call	1
upon	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
lost	1
woman	1
after	1
being	1
fascinated	1
by	1
that	1
woman	1
and	1
causing	1
his	1
wife	1
distress	1
he	1
could	1
still	1
go	1
quietly	1
to	1
sleep	1
But	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
fatigue	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
had	1
drunk	1
his	1
sleep	1
was	1
sound	1
and	1
untroubled	1
At	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
creak	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
opening	1
waked	1
him	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
Kitty	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
bed	1
beside	1
him	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
moving	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
steps	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
half	1
asleep	1
Kitty	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
Nothing	1
she	1
said	1
coming	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
with	1
a	1
candle	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
I	1
felt	1
unwell	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
a	1
particularly	1
sweet	1
and	1
meaning	1
smile	1
What	1
has	1
it	1
begun	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
terror	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
send	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
he	1
reached	1
after	1
his	1
clothes	1
No	1
no	1
she	1
said	1
smiling	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
It	1
s	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
I	1
was	1
rather	1
unwell	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
over	1
now	1
And	1
getting	1
into	1
bed	1
she	1
blew	1
out	1
the	1
candle	1
lay	1
down	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
Though	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
stillness	1
suspicious	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
holding	1
her	1
breath	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
suspicious	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
peculiar	1
tenderness	1
and	1
excitement	1
with	1
which	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
she	1
said	1
nothing	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
sleepy	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
once	1
Only	1
later	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
her	1
breathing	1
and	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
passing	1
in	1
her	1
sweet	1
precious	1
heart	1
while	1
she	1
lay	1
beside	1
him	1
not	1
stirring	1
in	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
event	1
in	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
life	1
At	1
seven	1
o	1
clock	1
he	1
was	1
waked	1
by	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
a	1
gentle	1
whisper	1
She	1
seemed	1
struggling	1
between	1
regret	1
at	1
waking	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
Kostya	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
frightened	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
But	1
I	1
fancy	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
The	1
candle	1
was	1
lighted	1
again	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
holding	1
some	1
knitting	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
busy	1
upon	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
frightened	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
afraid	1
she	1
said	1
seeing	1
his	1
scared	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
pressed	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
He	1
hurriedly	1
jumped	1
up	1
hardly	1
awake	1
and	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown	1
then	1
he	1
stopped	1
still	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
himself	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
He	1
thought	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
face	1
knew	1
her	1
expression	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
never	1
had	1
he	1
seen	1
it	1
like	1
this	1
How	1
hateful	1
and	1
horrible	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
himself	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
distress	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
her	1
yesterday	1
Her	1
flushed	1
face	1
fringed	1
with	1
soft	1
curling	1
hair	1
under	1
her	1
night	1
cap	1
was	1
radiant	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
courage	1
Though	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
was	1
complex	1
or	1
artificial	1
in	1
Kitty	1
s	1
character	1
in	1
general	1
Levin	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
what	1
was	1
revealed	1
now	1
when	1
suddenly	1
all	1
disguises	1
were	1
thrown	1
off	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
kernel	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
simplicity	1
and	1
nakedness	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
the	1
very	1
woman	1
he	1
loved	1
in	1
her	1
was	1
more	1
manifest	1
than	1
ever	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
smiling	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
her	1
brows	1
twitched	1
she	1
threw	1
up	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
going	1
quickly	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
clutched	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
pressed	1
close	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
breathing	1
her	1
hot	1
breath	1
upon	1
him	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
pain	1
and	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
complaining	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
suffering	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
from	1
habit	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
But	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tenderness	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
reproaching	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
If	1
not	1
I	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
thought	1
unconsciously	1
seeking	1
someone	1
responsible	1
for	1
this	1
suffering	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
punish	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
responsible	1
She	1
was	1
suffering	1
complaining	1
and	1
triumphing	1
in	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
loving	1
them	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
sublime	1
was	1
being	1
accomplished	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
but	1
what	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
It	1
was	1
beyond	1
his	1
understanding	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
mamma	1
You	1
go	1
quickly	1
to	1
fetch	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
Kostya	1
Nothing	1
it	1
s	1
over	1
She	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
Well	1
go	1
now	1
Pasha	1
s	1
coming	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
right	1
And	1
Levin	1
saw	1
with	1
astonishment	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
knitting	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
begun	1
working	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
As	1
Levin	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
one	1
door	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
maid	1
servant	1
come	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
He	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
heard	1
Kitty	1
giving	1
exact	1
directions	1
to	1
the	1
maid	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
move	1
the	1
bedstead	1
He	1
dressed	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
putting	1
in	1
his	1
horses	1
as	1
a	1
hired	1
sledge	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
yet	1
he	1
ran	1
again	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
not	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
on	1
wings	1
Two	1
maid	1
servants	1
were	1
carefully	1
moving	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
Kitty	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
knitting	1
rapidly	1
and	1
giving	1
directions	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
doctor	1
They	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
but	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
on	1
there	1
too	1
Isn	1
t	1
there	1
anything	1
wanted	1
Yes	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
Dolly	1
s	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
obviously	1
not	1
hearing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
Yes	1
yes	1
Do	1
go	1
she	1
said	1
quickly	1
frowning	1
and	1
waving	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
plaintive	1
moan	1
sounded	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
smothered	1
instantly	1
He	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
Yes	1
that	1
is	1
she	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
clutching	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
pardon	1
us	1
aid	1
us	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
came	1
suddenly	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
And	1
he	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
repeated	1
these	1
words	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
doubts	1
even	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
believing	1
with	1
his	1
reason	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
in	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
hinder	1
his	1
turning	1
to	1
God	1
All	1
of	1
that	1
now	1
floated	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
like	1
dust	1
To	1
whom	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
turn	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
Him	1
in	1
whose	1
hands	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
his	1
love	1
The	1
horse	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
ready	1
but	1
feeling	1
a	1
peculiar	1
concentration	1
of	1
his	1
physical	1
forces	1
and	1
his	1
intellect	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
started	1
off	1
on	1
foot	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
told	1
Kouzma	1
to	1
overtake	1
him	1
At	1
the	1
corner	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
night	1
cabman	1
driving	1
hurriedly	1
In	1
the	1
little	1
sledge	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
velvet	1
cloak	1
sat	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
with	1
a	1
kerchief	1
round	1
her	1
head	1
Thank	1
God	1
thank	1
God	1
he	1
said	1
overjoyed	1
to	1
recognize	1
her	1
little	1
fair	1
face	1
which	1
wore	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
serious	1
even	1
stern	1
expression	1
Telling	1
the	1
driver	1
not	1
to	1
stop	1
he	1
ran	1
along	1
beside	1
her	1
For	1
two	1
hours	1
then	1
Not	1
more	1
she	1
inquired	1
You	1
should	1
let	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
know	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
hurry	1
him	1
And	1
get	1
some	1
opium	1
at	1
the	1
chemist	1
s	1
So	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
on	1
well	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
help	1
us	1
Levin	1
said	1
seeing	1
his	1
own	1
horse	1
driving	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
Jumping	1
into	1
the	1
sledge	1
beside	1
Kouzma	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
Chapter	1
14	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
footman	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
up	1
late	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
orders	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
waked	1
but	1
would	1
get	1
up	1
soon	1
The	1
footman	1
was	1
cleaning	1
the	1
lamp	1
chimneys	1
and	1
seemed	1
very	1
busy	1
about	1
them	1
This	1
concentration	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
upon	1
his	1
lamps	1
and	1
his	1
indifference	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
Levin	1
at	1
first	1
astounded	1
him	1
but	1
immediately	1
on	1
considering	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
or	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
feelings	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
necessary	1
to	1
act	1
calmly	1
sensibly	1
and	1
resolutely	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
this	1
wall	1
of	1
indifference	1
and	1
attain	1
his	1
aim	1
Don	1
t	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
or	1
let	1
anything	1
slip	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
greater	1
flow	1
of	1
physical	1
energy	1
and	1
attention	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
Having	1
ascertained	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
not	1
getting	1
up	1
Levin	1
considered	1
various	1
plans	1
and	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
one	1
that	1
Kouzma	1
should	1
go	1
for	1
another	1
doctor	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
chemist	1
s	1
for	1
opium	1
and	1
if	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
begun	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
he	1
would	1
either	1
by	1
tipping	1
the	1
footman	1
or	1
by	1
force	1
wake	1
the	1
doctor	1
at	1
all	1
hazards	1
At	1
the	1
chemist	1
s	1
the	1
lank	1
shopman	1
sealed	1
up	1
a	1
packet	1
of	1
powders	1
for	1
a	1
coachman	1
who	1
stood	1
waiting	1
and	1
refused	1
him	1
opium	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
callousness	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
footman	1
had	1
cleaned	1
his	1
lamp	1
chimneys	1
Trying	1
not	1
to	1
get	1
flurried	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1
Levin	1
mentioned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
midwife	1
and	1
explaining	1
what	1
the	1
opium	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
The	1
assistant	1
inquired	1
in	1
German	1
whether	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
it	1
and	1
receiving	1
an	1
affirmative	1
reply	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
partition	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
bottle	1
and	1
a	1
funnel	1
deliberately	1
poured	1
the	1
opium	1
from	1
a	1
bigger	1
bottle	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
one	1
stuck	1
on	1
a	1
label	1
sealed	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
request	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
wrap	1
it	1
up	1
too	1
This	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
Levin	1
could	1
stand	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
firmly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
glass	1
doors	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
now	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
footman	1
busy	1
now	1
in	1
putting	1
down	1
the	1
rugs	1
refused	1
to	1
wake	1
him	1
Levin	1
deliberately	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
ten	1
rouble	1
note	1
and	1
careful	1
to	1
speak	1
slowly	1
though	1
losing	1
no	1
time	1
over	1
the	1
business	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
explained	1
that	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
what	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
important	1
personage	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
now	1
this	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
consequence	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
before	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
be	1
angry	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
therefore	1
wake	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
The	1
footman	1
agreed	1
and	1
went	1
upstairs	1
taking	1
Levin	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
Levin	1
could	1
hear	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
the	1
doctor	1
coughing	1
moving	1
about	1
washing	1
and	1
saying	1
something	1
Three	1
minutes	1
passed	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Levin	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
had	1
gone	1
by	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
wait	1
any	1
longer	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
imploring	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
forgive	1
me	1
See	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
It	1
s	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hours	1
already	1
In	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
answered	1
a	1
voice	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
amazement	1
Levin	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
For	1
one	1
instant	1
In	1
a	1
minute	1
Two	1
minutes	1
more	1
passed	1
while	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
boots	1
and	1
two	1
minutes	1
more	1
while	1
the	1
doctor	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
combed	1
his	1
hair	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Levin	1
was	1
beginning	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
plaintive	1
voice	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
doctor	1
came	1
in	1
dressed	1
and	1
ready	1
These	1
people	1
have	1
no	1
conscience	1
thought	1
Levin	1
Combing	1
his	1
hair	1
while	1
we	1
re	1
dying	1
Good	1
morning	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
shaking	1
hands	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
teasing	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
composure	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
hurry	1
Well	1
now	1
Trying	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
accurate	1
as	1
possible	1
Levin	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
every	1
unnecessary	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
condition	1
interrupting	1
his	1
account	1
repeatedly	1
with	1
entreaties	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
would	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
Oh	1
you	1
needn	1
t	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
hurry	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
m	1
certain	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
wanted	1
still	1
I	1
ve	1
promised	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
I	1
ll	1
come	1
But	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
hurry	1
Please	1
sit	1
down	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
coffee	1
Levin	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
asked	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
of	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
smiling	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
myself	1
and	1
at	1
these	1
moments	1
we	1
husbands	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied	1
I	1
ve	1
a	1
patient	1
whose	1
husband	1
always	1
takes	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
stables	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
But	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
Pyotr	1
Dmitrievitch	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
it	1
may	1
go	1
all	1
right	1
Everything	1
points	1
to	1
a	1
favorable	1
issue	1
So	1
you	1
ll	1
come	1
immediately	1
said	1
Levin	1
looking	1
wrathfully	1
at	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
coffee	1
In	1
an	1
hour	1
s	1
time	1
Oh	1
for	1
mercy	1
s	1
sake	1
Well	1
let	1
me	1
drink	1
my	1
coffee	1
anyway	1
The	1
doctor	1
started	1
upon	1
his	1
coffee	1
Both	1
were	1
silent	1
The	1
Turks	1
are	1
really	1
getting	1
beaten	1
though	1
Did	1
you	1
read	1
yesterday	1
s	1
telegrams	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
munching	1
some	1
roll	1
No	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
stand	1
it	1
said	1
Levin	1
jumping	1
up	1
So	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
In	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
On	1
your	1
honor	1
When	1
Levin	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
door	1
together	1
The	1
princess	1
had	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
shaking	1
Seeing	1
Levin	1
she	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
Well	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
she	1
queried	1
clasping	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
midwife	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
and	1
anxious	1
face	1
She	1
s	1
going	1
on	1
well	1
she	1
said	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
easier	1
so	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
waked	1
up	1
and	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
Levin	1
had	1
prepared	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
bear	1
resolutely	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
without	1
considering	1
or	1
anticipating	1
anything	1
to	1
avoid	1
upsetting	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
soothe	1
her	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
her	1
courage	1
Without	1
allowing	1
himself	1
even	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
end	1
judging	1
from	1
his	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
duration	1
of	1
these	1
ordeals	1
Levin	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
braced	1
himself	1
to	1
bear	1
up	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
tight	1
rein	1
on	1
his	1
feelings	1
for	1
five	1
hours	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
this	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
sufferings	1
again	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
repeating	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
succor	1
us	1
He	1
sighed	1
and	1
flung	1
his	1
head	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
afraid	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
or	1
run	1
away	1
Such	1
agony	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
And	1
only	1
one	1
hour	1
had	1
passed	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
hour	1
there	1
passed	1
another	1
hour	1
two	1
hours	1
three	1
the	1
full	1
five	1
hours	1
he	1
had	1
fixed	1
as	1
the	1
furthest	1
limit	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
still	1
unchanged	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
bearing	1
it	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
bear	1
it	1
every	1
instant	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
utmost	1
limits	1
of	1
his	1
endurance	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
would	1
break	1
with	1
sympathy	1
and	1
pain	1
But	1
still	1
the	1
minutes	1
passed	1
by	1
and	1
the	1
hours	1
and	1
still	1
hours	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
misery	1
and	1
horror	1
grew	1
and	1
were	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
intense	1
All	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
which	1
one	1
can	1
form	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
anything	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
exist	1
for	1
Levin	1
He	1
lost	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
time	1
Minutes	1
those	1
minutes	1
when	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
moist	1
hand	1
that	1
would	1
squeeze	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
violence	1
and	1
then	1
push	1
it	1
away	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
minutes	1
He	1
was	1
surprised	1
when	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
candle	1
behind	1
a	1
screen	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
surprised	1
Where	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
knew	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
anything	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
swollen	1
face	1
sometimes	1
bewildered	1
and	1
in	1
agony	1
sometimes	1
smiling	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
too	1
flushed	1
and	1
overwrought	1
with	1
her	1
gray	1
curls	1
in	1
disorder	1
forcing	1
herself	1
to	1
gulp	1
down	1
her	1
tears	1
biting	1
her	1
lips	1
he	1
saw	1
Dolly	1
too	1
and	1
the	1
doctor	1
smoking	1
fat	1
cigarettes	1
and	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
resolute	1
reassuring	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
face	1
But	1
why	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
where	1
a	1
table	1
set	1
for	1
dinner	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
but	1
Dolly	1
was	1
Then	1
Levin	1
remembered	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
somewhere	1
Once	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
move	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
sofa	1
He	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
eagerly	1
thinking	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
and	1
only	1
later	1
on	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
bed	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
getting	1
ready	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
doctor	1
something	1
The	1
doctor	1
had	1
answered	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
said	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
irregularities	1
in	1
the	1
municipal	1
council	1
Then	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
in	1
its	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
setting	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
old	1
waiting	1
maid	1
he	1
had	1
clambered	1
on	1
a	1
shelf	1
to	1
reach	1
it	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
little	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
reassure	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
he	1
carried	1
the	1
holy	1
picture	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
at	1
Kitty	1
s	1
head	1
carefully	1
tucking	1
it	1
in	1
behind	1
the	1
pillow	1
But	1
where	1
when	1
and	1
why	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
happened	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
why	1
the	1
old	1
princess	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
looking	1
compassionately	1
at	1
him	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
worry	1
himself	1
and	1
Dolly	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
something	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
doctor	1
looked	1
seriously	1
and	1
with	1
commiseration	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
something	1
All	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
felt	1
was	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
nearly	1
a	1
year	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
hotel	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
town	1
at	1
the	1
deathbed	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
Nikolay	1
But	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
grief	1
this	1
was	1
joy	1
Yet	1
that	1
grief	1
and	1
this	1
joy	1
were	1
alike	1
outside	1
all	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
they	1
were	1
loop	1
holes	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
ordinary	1
life	1
through	1
which	1
there	1
came	1
glimpses	1
of	1
something	1
sublime	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
this	1
sublime	1
something	1
the	1
soul	1
was	1
exalted	1
to	1
inconceivable	1
heights	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
before	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
while	1
reason	1
lagged	1
behind	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
it	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
succor	1
us	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
incessantly	1
feeling	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
complete	1
alienation	1
from	1
religion	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
just	1
as	1
trustfully	1
and	1
simply	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
childhood	1
and	1
first	1
youth	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
distinct	1
spiritual	1
conditions	1
One	1
was	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
doctor	1
who	1
kept	1
smoking	1
one	1
fat	1
cigarette	1
after	1
another	1
and	1
extinguishing	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
ashtray	1
with	1
Dolly	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
talk	1
about	1
dinner	1
about	1
politics	1
about	1
Marya	1
Petrovna	1
s	1
illness	1
and	1
where	1
Levin	1
suddenly	1
forgot	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
waked	1
up	1
from	1
sleep	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
at	1
her	1
pillow	1
where	1
his	1
heart	1
seemed	1
breaking	1
and	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
break	1
from	1
sympathetic	1
suffering	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
without	1
ceasing	1
And	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
oblivion	1
by	1
a	1
scream	1
reaching	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
bedroom	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
strange	1
terror	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
minute	1
Every	1
time	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
shriek	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
ran	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
remembered	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
defend	1
her	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
he	1
saw	1
again	1
that	1
help	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
terror	1
and	1
prayed	1
Lord	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
help	1
us	1
And	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
both	1
these	1
conditions	1
became	1
more	1
intense	1
the	1
calmer	1
he	1
became	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
completely	1
forgetting	1
her	1
the	1
more	1
agonizing	1
became	1
both	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
his	1
feeling	1
of	1
helplessness	1
before	1
them	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
but	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
called	1
upon	1
him	1
he	1
blamed	1
her	1
but	1
seeing	1
her	1
patient	1
smiling	1
face	1
and	1
hearing	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
am	1
worrying	1
you	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
God	1
but	1
thinking	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
beseeching	1
God	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
Chapter	1
15	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
or	1
early	1
The	1
candles	1
had	1
all	1
burned	1
out	1
Dolly	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
had	1
suggested	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
lie	1
down	1
Levin	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
stories	1
of	1
a	1
quack	1
mesmerizer	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
his	1
cigarette	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
repose	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sunk	1
into	1
oblivion	1
He	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
now	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
chat	1
and	1
understood	1
it	1
Suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
unearthly	1
shriek	1
The	1
shriek	1
was	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
jump	1
up	1
but	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
gazed	1
in	1
terrified	1
inquiry	1
at	1
the	1
doctor	1
The	1
doctor	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
listened	1
and	1
smiled	1
approvingly	1
Everything	1
was	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
strike	1
Levin	1
as	1
strange	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
still	1
sat	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
Whose	1
scream	1
was	1
this	1
He	1
jumped	1
up	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
edged	1
round	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
position	1
at	1
Kitty	1
s	1
pillow	1
The	1
scream	1
had	1
subsided	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
change	1
now	1
What	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
comprehend	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
or	1
comprehend	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
s	1
face	1
was	1
stern	1
and	1
pale	1
and	1
still	1
as	1
resolute	1
though	1
her	1
jaws	1
were	1
twitching	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
intently	1
on	1
Kitty	1
Kitty	1
s	1
swollen	1
and	1
agonized	1
face	1
a	1
tress	1
of	1
hair	1
clinging	1
to	1
her	1
moist	1
brow	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
sought	1
his	1
eyes	1
Her	1
lifted	1
hands	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
hands	1
Clutching	1
his	1
chill	1
hands	1
in	1
her	1
moist	1
ones	1
she	1
began	1
squeezing	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
face	1
Don	1
t	1
go	1
don	1
t	1
go	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
afraid	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
afraid	1
she	1
said	1
rapidly	1
Mamma	1
take	1
my	1
earrings	1
They	1
bother	1
me	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
afraid	1
Quick	1
quick	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
She	1
spoke	1
quickly	1
very	1
quickly	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
But	1
suddenly	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
drawn	1
she	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
Oh	1
this	1
is	1
awful	1
I	1
m	1
dying	1
I	1
m	1
dying	1
Go	1
away	1
she	1
shrieked	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
unearthly	1
scream	1
Levin	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
It	1
s	1
nothing	1
it	1
s	1
nothing	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
right	1
Dolly	1
called	1
after	1
him	1
But	1
they	1
might	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
liked	1
he	1
knew	1
now	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
over	1
He	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
his	1
head	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
door	1
post	1
and	1
heard	1
shrieks	1
howls	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
before	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
Kitty	1
was	1
uttering	1
these	1
shrieks	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
ceased	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
By	1
now	1
he	1
loathed	1
this	1
child	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
for	1
her	1
life	1
now	1
all	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
awful	1
anguish	1
Doctor	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
By	1
God	1
he	1
said	1
snatching	1
at	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
end	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
And	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
grave	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
that	1
Levin	1
took	1
the	1
end	1
as	1
meaning	1
her	1
death	1
Beside	1
himself	1
he	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
It	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
frowning	1
and	1
stern	1
Kitty	1
s	1
face	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
In	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
fearful	1
in	1
its	1
strained	1
distortion	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
it	1
He	1
fell	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
wooden	1
framework	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
feeling	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
bursting	1
The	1
awful	1
scream	1
never	1
paused	1
it	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
awful	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
utmost	1
limit	1
of	1
terror	1
suddenly	1
it	1
ceased	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
his	1
ears	1
but	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
scream	1
had	1
ceased	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
subdued	1
stir	1
and	1
bustle	1
and	1
hurried	1
breathing	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
gasping	1
alive	1
tender	1
and	1
blissful	1
uttered	1
softly	1
It	1
s	1
over	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
With	1
her	1
hands	1
hanging	1
exhausted	1
on	1
the	1
quilt	1
looking	1
extraordinarily	1
lovely	1
and	1
serene	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
And	1
suddenly	1
from	1
the	1
mysterious	1
and	1
awful	1
far	1
away	1
world	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
twenty	1
two	1
hours	1
Levin	1
felt	1
himself	1
all	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
borne	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
every	1
day	1
world	1
glorified	1
though	1
now	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
radiance	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
it	1
The	1
strained	1
chords	1
snapped	1
sobs	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
foreseen	1
rose	1
up	1
with	1
such	1
violence	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
shook	1
that	1
for	1
long	1
they	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
speaking	1
Falling	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
bed	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
hand	1
before	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
weak	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
fingers	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
kiss	1
And	1
meanwhile	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
deft	1
hands	1
of	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
like	1
a	1
flickering	1
light	1
in	1
a	1
lamp	1
lay	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
creature	1
which	1
had	1
never	1
existed	1
before	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
right	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
importance	1
to	1
itself	1
live	1
and	1
create	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
image	1
Alive	1
alive	1
And	1
a	1
boy	1
too	1
Set	1
your	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
Levin	1
heard	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
saying	1
as	1
she	1
slapped	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
shaking	1
hand	1
Mamma	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
said	1
Kitty	1
s	1
voice	1
The	1
princess	1
s	1
sobs	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
answers	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
silence	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
unmistakable	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
s	1
question	1
a	1
voice	1
quite	1
unlike	1
the	1
subdued	1
voices	1
speaking	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
bold	1
clamorous	1
self	1
assertive	1
squall	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
human	1
being	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
incomprehensibly	1
appeared	1
If	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
before	1
that	1
Kitty	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
died	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
children	1
were	1
angels	1
and	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
standing	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
at	1
nothing	1
But	1
now	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
reality	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
great	1
mental	1
efforts	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
alive	1
and	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
creature	1
squalling	1
so	1
desperately	1
was	1
his	1
son	1
Kitty	1
was	1
alive	1
her	1
agony	1
was	1
over	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
unutterably	1
happy	1
That	1
he	1
understood	1
he	1
was	1
completely	1
happy	1
in	1
it	1
But	1
the	1
baby	1
Whence	1
why	1
who	1
was	1
he	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
something	1
extraneous	1
superfluous	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
accustom	1
himself	1
Chapter	1
16	1
At	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
Levin	1
s	1
Having	1
inquired	1
after	1
Kitty	1
they	1
had	1
dropped	1
into	1
conversation	1
upon	1
other	1
subjects	1
Levin	1
heard	1
them	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
as	1
they	1
talked	1
going	1
over	1
the	1
past	1
over	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
morning	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
yesterday	1
till	1
that	1
point	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
hundred	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
then	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
exalted	1
to	1
unattainable	1
heights	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
studiously	1
lowered	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
wound	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
He	1
talked	1
and	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
of	1
her	1
condition	1
now	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
whose	1
existence	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
school	1
himself	1
into	1
believing	1
The	1
whole	1
world	1
of	1
woman	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
for	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
a	1
new	1
value	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
suspected	1
before	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
exalted	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
He	1
heard	1
them	1
talk	1
of	1
yesterday	1
s	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
club	1
and	1
thought	1
What	1
is	1
happening	1
with	1
her	1
now	1
Is	1
she	1
asleep	1
How	1
is	1
she	1
What	1
is	1
she	1
thinking	1
of	1
Is	1
he	1
crying	1
my	1
son	1
Dmitri	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sentence	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Send	1
me	1
word	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
her	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
Very	1
well	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
answered	1
Levin	1
and	1
without	1
stopping	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
asleep	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
gently	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
making	1
plans	1
about	1
the	1
christening	1
Carefully	1
set	1
to	1
rights	1
with	1
hair	1
well	1
brushed	1
in	1
a	1
smart	1
little	1
cap	1
with	1
some	1
blue	1
in	1
it	1
her	1
arms	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
quilt	1
she	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
her	1
back	1
Meeting	1
his	1
eyes	1
her	1
eyes	1
drew	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
Her	1
face	1
bright	1
before	1
brightened	1
still	1
more	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
her	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
change	1
in	1
it	1
from	1
earthly	1
to	1
unearthly	1
that	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
But	1
then	1
it	1
means	1
farewell	1
here	1
it	1
meant	1
welcome	1
Again	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
emotion	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
birth	1
flooded	1
his	1
heart	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
struggling	1
with	1
his	1
weakness	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
nap	1
Kostya	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
comfortable	1
now	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
expression	1
changed	1
Give	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
hearing	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
cry	1
Give	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
his	1
papa	1
shall	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
said	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
bringing	1
something	1
red	1
and	1
queer	1
and	1
wriggling	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
we	1
ll	1
make	1
him	1
tidy	1
first	1
and	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
laid	1
the	1
red	1
wobbling	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
began	1
untrussing	1
and	1
trussing	1
up	1
the	1
baby	1
lifting	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
turning	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
and	1
powdering	1
it	1
with	1
something	1
Levin	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
tiny	1
pitiful	1
creature	1
made	1
strenuous	1
efforts	1
to	1
discover	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
some	1
traces	1
of	1
fatherly	1
feeling	1
for	1
it	1
He	1
felt	1
nothing	1
towards	1
it	1
but	1
disgust	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
undressed	1
and	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
wee	1
wee	1
little	1
hands	1
little	1
feet	1
saffron	1
colored	1
with	1
little	1
toes	1
too	1
and	1
positively	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
big	1
toe	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
closing	1
the	1
wide	1
open	1
little	1
hands	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
soft	1
springs	1
and	1
putting	1
them	1
into	1
linen	1
garments	1
such	1
pity	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
creature	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
such	1
terror	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
hurt	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
hand	1
back	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
laughed	1
Don	1
t	1
be	1
frightened	1
don	1
t	1
be	1
frightened	1
When	1
the	1
baby	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
to	1
rights	1
and	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
firm	1
doll	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
dandled	1
it	1
as	1
though	1
proud	1
of	1
her	1
handiwork	1
and	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
away	1
so	1
that	1
Levin	1
might	1
see	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
Kitty	1
looked	1
sideways	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
never	1
taking	1
her	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
baby	1
Give	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
give	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
even	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
sit	1
up	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
you	1
mustn	1
t	1
move	1
like	1
that	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
I	1
ll	1
give	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
Here	1
we	1
re	1
showing	1
papa	1
what	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
we	1
are	1
And	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
supporting	1
the	1
wobbling	1
head	1
lifted	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
arm	1
the	1
strange	1
limp	1
red	1
creature	1
whose	1
head	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
its	1
swaddling	1
clothes	1
But	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
nose	1
too	1
and	1
slanting	1
eyes	1
and	1
smacking	1
lips	1
A	1
splendid	1
baby	1
said	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
Levin	1
sighed	1
with	1
mortification	1
This	1
splendid	1
baby	1
excited	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
feeling	1
but	1
disgust	1
and	1
compassion	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
while	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
put	1
the	1
baby	1
to	1
the	1
unaccustomed	1
breast	1
Suddenly	1
laughter	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
round	1
The	1
baby	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
breast	1
Come	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1
that	1
s	1
enough	1
said	1
Lizaveta	1
Petrovna	1
but	1
Kitty	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
baby	1
go	1
He	1
fell	1
asleep	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
Look	1
now	1
said	1
Kitty	1
turning	1
the	1
baby	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
The	1
aged	1
looking	1
little	1
face	1
suddenly	1
puckered	1
up	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
the	1
baby	1
sneezed	1
Smiling	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
tears	1
Levin	1
kissed	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
room	1
What	1
he	1
felt	1
towards	1
this	1
little	1
creature	1
was	1
utterly	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
cheerful	1
and	1
joyous	1
in	1
the	1
feeling	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
torture	1
of	1
apprehension	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
sphere	1
of	1
liability	1
to	1
pain	1
And	1
this	1
sense	1
was	1
so	1
painful	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
apprehension	1
lest	1
this	1
helpless	1
creature	1
should	1
suffer	1
was	1
so	1
intense	1
that	1
it	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
noticing	1
the	1
strange	1
thrill	1
of	1
senseless	1
joy	1
and	1
even	1
pride	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
when	1
the	1
baby	1
sneezed	1
Chapter	1
17	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
affairs	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
way	1
The	1
money	1
for	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
spent	1
already	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
borrowed	1
from	1
the	1
merchant	1
in	1
advance	1
at	1
ten	1
per	1
cent	1
discount	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
remaining	1
third	1
The	1
merchant	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
winter	1
insisting	1
on	1
her	1
right	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
property	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
sign	1
the	1
receipt	1
for	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
All	1
his	1
salary	1
went	1
on	1
household	1
expenses	1
and	1
in	1
payment	1
of	1
petty	1
debts	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
off	1
There	1
was	1
positively	1
no	1
money	1
This	1
was	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
awkward	1
and	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
opinion	1
things	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
The	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
view	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
salary	1
was	1
too	1
small	1
The	1
post	1
he	1
filled	1
had	1
been	1
unmistakably	1
very	1
good	1
five	1
years	1
ago	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
no	1
longer	1
Petrov	1
the	1
bank	1
director	1
had	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
Sventitsky	1
a	1
company	1
director	1
had	1
seventeen	1
thousand	1
Mitin	1
who	1
had	1
founded	1
a	1
bank	1
received	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
Clearly	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
napping	1
and	1
they	1
ve	1
overlooked	1
me	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
thought	1
about	1
himself	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
keeping	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
open	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
he	1
had	1
discovered	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
berth	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
upon	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
from	1
Moscow	1
through	1
aunts	1
uncles	1
and	1
friends	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
well	1
advanced	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
he	1
went	1
himself	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
snug	1
lucrative	1
berths	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
nowadays	1
than	1
there	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
incomes	1
ranging	1
from	1
one	1
thousand	1
to	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
of	1
the	1
amalgamated	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
southern	1
railways	1
and	1
of	1
certain	1
banking	1
companies	1
This	1
position	1
like	1
all	1
such	1
appointments	1
called	1
for	1
such	1
immense	1
energy	1
and	1
such	1
varied	1
qualifications	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
united	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
man	1
And	1
since	1
a	1
man	1
combining	1
all	1
the	1
qualifications	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
better	1
that	1
the	1
post	1
be	1
filled	1
by	1
an	1
honest	1
than	1
by	1
a	1
dishonest	1
man	1
And	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
unemphatically	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
acceptation	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
emphatically	1
in	1
that	1
special	1
sense	1
which	1
the	1
word	1
has	1
in	1
Moscow	1
when	1
they	1
talk	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
politician	1
an	1
honest	1
writer	1
an	1
honest	1
newspaper	1
an	1
honest	1
institution	1
an	1
honest	1
tendency	1
meaning	1
not	1
simply	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
or	1
the	1
institution	1
is	1
not	1
dishonest	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
capable	1
on	1
occasion	1
of	1
taking	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
authorities	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
moved	1
in	1
those	1
circles	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
expression	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
use	1
was	1
regarded	1
there	1
as	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
more	1
right	1
to	1
this	1
appointment	1
than	1
others	1
The	1
appointment	1
yielded	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
from	1
seven	1
to	1
ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
Oblonsky	1
could	1
fill	1
it	1
without	1
giving	1
up	1
his	1
government	1
position	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
two	1
ministers	1
one	1
lady	1
and	1
two	1
Jews	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
though	1
the	1
way	1
had	1
been	1
paved	1
already	1
with	1
them	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
Besides	1
this	1
business	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
promised	1
his	1
sister	1
Anna	1
to	1
obtain	1
from	1
Karenin	1
a	1
definite	1
answer	1
on	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
divorce	1
And	1
begging	1
fifty	1
roubles	1
from	1
Dolly	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Petersburg	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
sat	1
in	1
Karenin	1
s	1
study	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
report	1
on	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
position	1
of	1
Russian	1
finance	1
and	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
finish	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
own	1
business	1
or	1
about	1
Anna	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
true	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
pince	1
nez	1
without	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
now	1
and	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
former	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
true	1
in	1
particular	1
cases	1
but	1
still	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
our	1
day	1
is	1
freedom	1
Yes	1
but	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
another	1
principle	1
embracing	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
freedom	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
with	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
embracing	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
pince	1
nez	1
again	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
passage	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
statement	1
was	1
made	1
And	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
beautifully	1
written	1
wide	1
margined	1
manuscript	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
read	1
aloud	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
conclusive	1
passage	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
advocate	1
protection	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
private	1
interests	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
weal	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
lower	1
and	1
upper	1
classes	1
equally	1
he	1
said	1
looking	1
over	1
his	1
pince	1
nez	1
at	1
Oblonsky	1
But	1
they	1
cannot	1
grasp	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
taken	1
up	1
now	1
with	1
personal	1
interests	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
phrases	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
Karenin	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
and	1
thinking	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
his	1
report	1
and	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
everything	1
wrong	1
in	1
Russia	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
coming	1
near	1
the	1
end	1
And	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
eagerly	1
abandoned	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
free	1
trade	1
and	1
fully	1
agreed	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
paused	1
thoughtfully	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
his	1
manuscript	1
Oh	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
some	1
time	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
Pomorsky	1
to	1
drop	1
him	1
a	1
hint	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
new	1
appointment	1
of	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
committee	1
of	1
the	1
amalgamated	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
southern	1
railways	1
and	1
banking	1
companies	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
familiar	1
by	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
he	1
coveted	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
rapidly	1
without	1
mistake	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
questioned	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
committee	1
and	1
pondered	1
He	1
was	1
considering	1
whether	1
the	1
new	1
committee	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
acting	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
advocating	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
committee	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
complex	1
nature	1
and	1
his	1
views	1
were	1
of	1
very	1
wide	1
application	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
decide	1
this	1
straight	1
off	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
pince	1
nez	1
he	1
said	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
can	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
reason	1
precisely	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
appointment	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
salary	1
rising	1
to	1
nine	1
thousand	1
and	1
my	1
means	1
Nine	1
thousand	1
repeated	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
he	1
frowned	1
The	1
high	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
salary	1
made	1
him	1
reflect	1
that	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
proposed	1
position	1
ran	1
counter	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
tendency	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
projects	1
of	1
reform	1
which	1
always	1
leaned	1
towards	1
economy	1
I	1
consider	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
embodied	1
my	1
views	1
in	1
a	1
note	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
these	1
immense	1
salaries	1
are	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
unsound	1
economic	1
assiette	1
of	1
our	1
finances	1
But	1
what	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Suppose	1
a	1
bank	1
director	1
gets	1
ten	1
thousand	1
well	1
he	1
s	1
worth	1
it	1
or	1
an	1
engineer	1
gets	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
growing	1
thing	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
assume	1
that	1
a	1
salary	1
is	1
the	1
price	1
paid	1
for	1
a	1
commodity	1
and	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
conform	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
supply	1
and	1
demand	1
If	1
the	1
salary	1
is	1
fixed	1
without	1
any	1
regard	1
for	1
that	1
law	1
as	1
for	1
instance	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
two	1
engineers	1
leaving	1
college	1
together	1
both	1
equally	1
well	1
trained	1
and	1
efficient	1
and	1
one	1
getting	1
forty	1
thousand	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
satisfied	1
with	1
two	1
or	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
lawyers	1
and	1
hussars	1
having	1
no	1
special	1
qualifications	1
appointed	1
directors	1
of	1
banking	1
companies	1
with	1
immense	1
salaries	1
I	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
salary	1
is	1
not	1
fixed	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
supply	1
and	1
demand	1
but	1
simply	1
through	1
personal	1
interest	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
abuse	1
of	1
great	1
gravity	1
in	1
itself	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
reacts	1
injuriously	1
on	1
the	1
government	1
service	1
I	1
consider	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
interrupt	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
Yes	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
agree	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
new	1
institution	1
of	1
undoubted	1
utility	1
that	1
s	1
being	1
started	1
After	1
all	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
growing	1
thing	1
What	1
they	1
lay	1
particular	1
stress	1
on	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
honestly	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
emphasis	1
But	1
the	1
Moscow	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
honest	1
was	1
lost	1
on	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Honesty	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
negative	1
qualification	1
he	1
said	1
Well	1
you	1
ll	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
service	1
anyway	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
by	1
putting	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Pomorsky	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
conversation	1
But	1
I	1
fancy	1
it	1
s	1
more	1
in	1
Volgarinov	1
s	1
hands	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Volgarinov	1
has	1
fully	1
assented	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
s	1
concerned	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
turning	1
red	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
reddened	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
that	1
name	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
morning	1
at	1
the	1
Jew	1
Volgarinov	1
s	1
and	1
the	1
visit	1
had	1
left	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
recollection	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
believed	1
most	1
positively	1
that	1
the	1
committee	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
appointment	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
genuine	1
and	1
honest	1
public	1
body	1
but	1
that	1
morning	1
when	1
Volgarinov	1
had	1
intentionally	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
kept	1
him	1
two	1
hours	1
waiting	1
with	1
other	1
petitioners	1
in	1
his	1
waiting	1
room	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
felt	1
uneasy	1
Whether	1
he	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
that	1
he	1
a	1
descendant	1
of	1
Rurik	1
Prince	1
Oblonsky	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
for	1
two	1
hours	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
Jew	1
or	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
following	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
his	1
ancestors	1
in	1
serving	1
the	1
government	1
but	1
was	1
turning	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
new	1
career	1
anyway	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
uncomfortable	1
During	1
those	1
two	1
hours	1
in	1
Volgarinov	1
s	1
waiting	1
room	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
stepping	1
jauntily	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
pulling	1
his	1
whiskers	1
entering	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
petitioners	1
and	1
inventing	1
an	1
epigram	1
on	1
his	1
position	1
assiduously	1
concealed	1
from	1
others	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
himself	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
was	1
experiencing	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
angry	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
why	1
whether	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
epigram	1
just	1
right	1
or	1
from	1
some	1
other	1
reason	1
When	1
at	1
last	1
Volgarinov	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
politeness	1
and	1
unmistakable	1
triumph	1
at	1
his	1
humiliation	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
but	1
refused	1
the	1
favor	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
forget	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
And	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
recollection	1
he	1
blushed	1

Now	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
About	1
Anna	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
pausing	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
space	1
and	1
shaking	1
off	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Oblonsky	1
uttered	1
Anna	1
s	1
name	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
was	1
completely	1
transformed	1
all	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1

it	1

weary	1
and	1
dead	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
exactly	1
that	1
you	1
want	1
from	1
me	1

said	1
moving	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
snapping	1

A	1
definite	1
settlement	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
some	1
settlement	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
I	1
m	1
appealing	1
to	1
you	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
injured	1
husband	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
but	1
afraid	1
of	1
wrecking	1
his	1
negotiation	1
by	1
this	1
he	1
changed	1
the	1
words	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
statesman	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
sound	1
`a	1
propos	1
but	1
simply	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
hearted	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
Christian	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
That	1
is	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
precisely	1
Karenin	1
said	1
softly	1
Yes	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
spending	1
all	1
the	1
winter	1
with	1
her	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
Her	1
position	1
is	1
awful	1
simply	1
awful	1
I	1
had	1
imagined	1
answered	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
in	1
a	1
higher	1
almost	1
shrill	1
voice	1
that	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
had	1
everything	1
she	1
had	1
desired	1
for	1
herself	1
Oh	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
let	1
us	1
indulge	1
in	1
recriminations	1
What	1
is	1
past	1
is	1
past	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
wants	1
and	1
is	1
waiting	1
for	1
divorce	1
But	1
I	1
believe	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
refuses	1
a	1
divorce	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
my	1
son	1
I	1
replied	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
and	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
ended	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
shrieked	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
But	1
for	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
hot	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
touching	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
s	1
knee	1
The	1
matter	1
is	1
not	1
ended	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
recapitulate	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
this	1
when	1
you	1
parted	1
you	1
were	1
as	1
magnanimous	1
as	1
could	1
possibly	1
be	1
you	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
everything	1
freedom	1
divorce	1
even	1
She	1
appreciated	1
that	1
No	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
that	1
She	1
did	1
appreciate	1
it	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
feeling	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
wronged	1
you	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
consider	1
everything	1
She	1
gave	1
up	1
everything	1
But	1
experience	1
time	1
have	1
shown	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
unbearable	1
impossible	1
The	1
life	1
of	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
interest	1
for	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
put	1
in	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
that	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
replied	1
gently	1
Her	1
position	1
is	1
intolerable	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
benefit	1
to	1
anyone	1
whatever	1
She	1
has	1
deserved	1
it	1
you	1
will	1
say	1
She	1
knows	1
that	1
and	1
asks	1
you	1
for	1
nothing	1
she	1
says	1
plainly	1
that	1
she	1
dare	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
But	1
I	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
her	1
relatives	1
all	1
who	1
love	1
her	1
beg	1
you	1
entreat	1
you	1
Why	1
should	1
she	1
suffer	1
Who	1
is	1
any	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
it	1
Excuse	1
me	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
party	1
observed	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Oh	1
no	1
oh	1
no	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
please	1
understand	1
me	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
touching	1
his	1
hand	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
feeling	1
sure	1
this	1
physical	1
contact	1
would	1
soften	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
this	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
intolerable	1
and	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
alleviated	1
by	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
lose	1
nothing	1
by	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
arrange	1
it	1
all	1
for	1
you	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
ll	1
not	1
notice	1
it	1
You	1
did	1
promise	1
it	1
you	1
know	1
The	1
promise	1
was	1
given	1
before	1
And	1
I	1
had	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
had	1
settled	1
the	1
matter	1
Besides	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
had	1
enough	1
generosity	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
articulated	1
with	1
difficulty	1
his	1
lips	1
twitching	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
white	1
She	1
leaves	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
your	1
generosity	1
She	1
begs	1
she	1
implores	1
one	1
thing	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
extricate	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
impossible	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
is	1
placed	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
her	1
son	1
now	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
Put	1
yourself	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
divorce	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
promised	1
it	1
once	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
reconciled	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
position	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
But	1
you	1
promised	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
wrote	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
Moscow	1
And	1
here	1
she	1
s	1
been	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
in	1
Moscow	1
where	1
every	1
chance	1
meeting	1
cuts	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
every	1
day	1
expecting	1
an	1
answer	1
Why	1
it	1
s	1
like	1
keeping	1
a	1
condemned	1
criminal	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
with	1
the	1
rope	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
promising	1
him	1
perhaps	1
death	1
perhaps	1
mercy	1
Have	1
pity	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
undertake	1
to	1
arrange	1
everything	1
Vos	1
scrupules	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
talking	1
about	1
that	1
about	1
that	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
interrupted	1
with	1
disgust	1
But	1
perhaps	1
I	1
promised	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
promise	1
So	1
you	1
go	1
back	1
from	1
your	1
promise	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
refused	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
possible	1
but	1
I	1
want	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
how	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
promised	1
is	1
possible	1
No	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
cried	1
Oblonsky	1
jumping	1
up	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
believe	1
that	1
She	1
s	1
unhappy	1
as	1
only	1
an	1
unhappy	1
woman	1
can	1
be	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
in	1
such	1
As	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
promised	1
as	1
is	1
possible	1
Vous	1

	1
But	1
I	1
as	1
a	1
believer	1
cannot	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
such	1
gravity	1
act	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
Christian	1
law	1
But	1
in	1
Christian	1
societies	1
and	1
among	1
us	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
m	1
aware	1
divorce	1
is	1
allowed	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Divorce	1
is	1
sanctioned	1
even	1
by	1
our	1
church	1
And	1
we	1
see	1
It	1
is	1
allowed	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
like	1
yourself	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
pause	1
Wasn	1
t	1
it	1
you	1
and	1
didn	1
t	1
we	1
all	1
appreciate	1
it	1
in	1
you	1
who	1
forgave	1
everything	1
and	1
moved	1
simply	1
by	1
Christian	1
feeling	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
sacrifice	1
You	1
said	1
yourself	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
thy	1
coat	1
give	1
him	1
thy	1
cloak	1
also	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
beg	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
shrilly	1
getting	1
suddenly	1
onto	1
his	1
feet	1
his	1
face	1
white	1
and	1
his	1
jaws	1
twitching	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
drop	1
this	1
to	1
drop	1
this	1
subject	1
Oh	1
no	1
Oh	1
forgive	1
me	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
wounded	1
you	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
messenger	1
I	1
have	1
simply	1
performed	1
the	1
commission	1
given	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
hand	1
pondered	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
said	1
I	1
must	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
seek	1
for	1
guidance	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
final	1
answer	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
considering	1
a	1
moment	1
Chapter	1
19	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
when	1
Korney	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
announce	1
Sergey	1
Alexyevitch	1
Who	1
s	1
Sergey	1
Alexyevitch	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
he	1
remembered	1
immediately	1
Ah	1
Seryozha	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
Sergey	1
Alexyevitch	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
director	1
of	1
a	1
department	1
Anna	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
too	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
timid	1
piteous	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
Anna	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
parting	1
Anyway	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
him	1
Find	1
out	1
exactly	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
who	1
is	1
looking	1
after	1
him	1
And	1
Stiva	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
Could	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
meant	1
by	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
divorce	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
her	1
son	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
that	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
nephew	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
reminded	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
about	1
her	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1
after	1
that	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
foreseen	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Indeed	1
we	1
feared	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
But	1
with	1
rational	1
treatment	1
and	1
sea	1
bathing	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
he	1
regained	1
his	1
strength	1
and	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
advice	1
I	1
have	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
school	1
And	1
certainly	1
the	1
companionship	1
of	1
school	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
perfectly	1
well	1
and	1
making	1
good	1
progress	1
What	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
he	1
s	1
grown	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
Seryozha	1
now	1
but	1
quite	1
full	1
fledged	1
Sergey	1
Alexyevitch	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
broad	1
shouldered	1
lad	1
in	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
long	1
trousers	1
who	1
walked	1
in	1
alertly	1
and	1
confidently	1
The	1
boy	1
looked	1
healthy	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
He	1
bowed	1
to	1
his	1
uncle	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
stranger	1
but	1
recognizing	1
him	1
he	1
blushed	1
and	1
turned	1
hurriedly	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
offended	1
and	1
irritated	1
at	1
something	1
The	1
boy	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
marks	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
in	1
school	1
Well	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
fair	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
He	1
s	1
thinner	1
and	1
taller	1
and	1
has	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
child	1
into	1
a	1
boy	1
I	1
like	1
that	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
The	1
boy	1
looked	1
back	1
quickly	1
at	1
his	1
uncle	1
Yes	1
mon	1
oncle	1
he	1
answered	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
looked	1
downcast	1
His	1
uncle	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
Well	1
and	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on	1
he	1
said	1
wanting	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
The	1
boy	1
blushing	1
and	1
making	1
no	1
answer	1
cautiously	1
drew	1
his	1
hand	1
away	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
glanced	1
doubtfully	1
at	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
set	1
free	1
he	1
darted	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
A	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
Seryozha	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
mother	1
Since	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
school	1
and	1
made	1
friends	1
among	1
his	1
schoolfellows	1
The	1
dreams	1
and	1
memories	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
ill	1
after	1
seeing	1
her	1
did	1
not	1
occupy	1
his	1
thoughts	1
now	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
studiously	1
drove	1
them	1
away	1
regarding	1
them	1
as	1
shameful	1
and	1
girlish	1
below	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
and	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
some	1
quarrel	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
idea	1
He	1
disliked	1
seeing	1
his	1
uncle	1
so	1
like	1
his	1
mother	1
for	1
it	1
called	1
up	1
those	1
memories	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
He	1
disliked	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
from	1
some	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
as	1
he	1
waited	1
at	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
uncle	1
he	1
guessed	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
talking	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
And	1
to	1
avoid	1
condemning	1
the	1
father	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
dependent	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
avoid	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
sentimentality	1
which	1
he	1
considered	1
so	1
degrading	1
Seryozha	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
uncle	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
recalled	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
when	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
going	1
out	1
after	1
him	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
calling	1
to	1
him	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
spent	1
his	1
playtime	1
at	1
school	1
Seryozha	1
talked	1
more	1
freely	1
to	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
presence	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
railway	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
uncle	1
s	1
question	1
It	1
s	1
like	1
this	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
two	1
sit	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
they	1
re	1
the	1
passengers	1
and	1
one	1
stands	1
up	1
straight	1
on	1
the	1
bench	1
And	1
all	1
are	1
harnessed	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
their	1
arms	1
or	1
by	1
their	1
belts	1
and	1
they	1
run	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
the	1
doors	1
are	1
left	1
open	1
beforehand	1
Well	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
pretty	1
hard	1
work	1
being	1
the	1
conductor	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
stands	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
inquired	1
smiling	1
Yes	1
you	1
want	1
pluck	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
cleverness	1
too	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
stop	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
or	1
someone	1
falls	1
down	1
Yes	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
serious	1
matter	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
watching	1
with	1
mournful	1
interest	1
the	1
eager	1
eyes	1
like	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
not	1
childish	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
fully	1
innocent	1
And	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Anna	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
himself	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
your	1
mother	1
he	1
asked	1
suddenly	1
No	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
Seryozha	1
said	1
quickly	1
He	1
blushed	1
crimson	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
And	1
his	1
uncle	1
could	1
get	1
nothing	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
His	1
tutor	1
found	1
his	1
pupil	1
on	1
the	1
staircase	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
ill	1
tempered	1
or	1
crying	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
expect	1
you	1
hurt	1
yourself	1
when	1
you	1
fell	1
down	1
said	1
the	1
tutor	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dangerous	1
game	1
And	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
director	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
hurt	1
myself	1
nobody	1
should	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
out	1
that	1
s	1
certain	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
Leave	1
me	1
alone	1
If	1
I	1
remember	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
what	1
business	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
his	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
remember	1
Leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
not	1
his	1
tutor	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
usual	1
did	1
not	1
waste	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
besides	1
business	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
divorce	1
and	1
his	1
coveted	1
appointment	1
he	1
wanted	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
to	1
freshen	1
himself	1
up	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
the	1
mustiness	1
of	1
Moscow	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
caf'es	1
chantants	1
and	1
its	1
omnibuses	1
Moscow	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
stagnant	1
bog	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
always	1
felt	1
it	1
After	1
living	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
Moscow	1
especially	1
in	1
close	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
depression	1
of	1
spirits	1
After	1
being	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
Moscow	1
without	1
a	1
change	1
he	1
reached	1
a	1
point	1
when	1
he	1
positively	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
worrying	1
himself	1
over	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
ill	1
humor	1
and	1
reproaches	1
over	1
his	1
children	1
s	1
health	1
and	1
education	1
and	1
the	1
petty	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
official	1
work	1
even	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
debt	1
worried	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
in	1
the	1
circle	1
there	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
moved	1
where	1
people	1
lived	1
really	1
lived	1
instead	1
of	1
vegetating	1
as	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
ideas	1
vanished	1
and	1
melted	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
wax	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
His	1
wife	1
Only	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
Prince	1
Tchetchensky	1
Prince	1
Tchetchensky	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
family	1
grown	1
up	1
pages	1
in	1
the	1
corps	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
another	1
illegitimate	1
family	1
of	1
children	1
also	1
Though	1
the	1
first	1
family	1
was	1
very	1
nice	1
too	1
Prince	1
Tchetchensky	1
felt	1
happier	1
in	1
his	1
second	1
family	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
eldest	1
son	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
second	1
family	1
and	1
told	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
enlarging	1
his	1
ideas	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
that	1
in	1
Moscow	1
His	1
children	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
children	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
their	1
parents	1
from	1
enjoying	1
life	1
The	1
children	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
schools	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
idea	1
that	1
prevailed	1
in	1
Moscow	1
in	1
Lvov	1
s	1
household	1
for	1
instance	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
luxuries	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
while	1
the	1
parents	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
work	1
and	1
anxiety	1
Here	1
people	1
understood	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
in	1
duty	1
bound	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
himself	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
culture	1
should	1
live	1
His	1
official	1
duties	1
Official	1
work	1
here	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
stiff	1
hopeless	1
drudgery	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Here	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
official	1
life	1
A	1
chance	1
meeting	1
a	1
service	1
rendered	1
a	1
happy	1
phrase	1
a	1
knack	1
of	1
facetious	1
mimicry	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
career	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
a	1
trice	1
So	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
Bryantsev	1
whom	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
functionaries	1
in	1
government	1
now	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
official	1
work	1
like	1
that	1
The	1
Petersburg	1
attitude	1
on	1
pecuniary	1
matters	1
had	1
an	1
especially	1
soothing	1
effect	1
on	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Bartnyansky	1
who	1
must	1
spend	1
at	1
least	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
style	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
interesting	1
comment	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
before	1
dinner	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
said	1
to	1
Bartnyansky	1
You	1
re	1
friendly	1
I	1
fancy	1
with	1
Mordvinsky	1
you	1
might	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
favor	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
him	1
please	1
for	1
me	1
There	1
s	1
an	1
appointment	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
get	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
agency	1
Oh	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
remember	1
all	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
But	1
what	1
possesses	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
railways	1
and	1
Jews	1
Take	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
low	1
business	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
Bartnyansky	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
growing	1
thing	1
Bartnyansky	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
understood	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
money	1
I	1
ve	1
nothing	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
You	1
re	1
living	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
Yes	1
but	1
in	1
debt	1
Are	1
you	1
though	1
Heavily	1
said	1
Bartnyansky	1
sympathetically	1
Very	1
heavily	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
Bartnyansky	1
broke	1
into	1
good	1
humored	1
laughter	1
Oh	1
lucky	1
fellow	1
said	1
he	1
My	1
debts	1
mount	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
million	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
and	1
I	1
ve	1
nothing	1
and	1
still	1
I	1
can	1
live	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
And	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
saw	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
not	1
in	1
words	1
only	1
but	1
in	1
actual	1
fact	1
Zhivahov	1
owed	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
hadn	1
t	1
a	1
farthing	1
to	1
bless	1
himself	1
with	1
and	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
in	1
style	1
too	1
Count	1
Krivtsov	1
was	1
considered	1
a	1
hopeless	1
case	1
by	1
everyone	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
kept	1
two	1
mistresses	1
Petrovsky	1
had	1
run	1
through	1
five	1
millions	1
and	1
still	1
lived	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
a	1
manager	1
in	1
the	1
financial	1
department	1
with	1
a	1
salary	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
But	1
besides	1
this	1
Petersburg	1
had	1
physically	1
an	1
agreeable	1
effect	1
on	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
younger	1
In	1
Moscow	1
he	1
sometimes	1
found	1
a	1
gray	1
hair	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
after	1
dinner	1
stretched	1
walked	1
slowly	1
upstairs	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
was	1
bored	1
by	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
young	1
women	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
dance	1
at	1
balls	1
In	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
ten	1
years	1
younger	1
His	1
experience	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
described	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
by	1
Prince	1
Pyotr	1
Oblonsky	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sixty	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
abroad	1
We	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
live	1
here	1
said	1
Pyotr	1
Oblonsky	1
I	1
spent	1
the	1
summer	1
in	1
Baden	1
and	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
it	1
I	1
felt	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
At	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
my	1
thoughts	1
One	1
dines	1
and	1
drinks	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
feels	1
strong	1
and	1
ready	1
for	1
anything	1
I	1
came	1
home	1
to	1
Russia	1
had	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
what	1
s	1
more	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
country	1
place	1
and	1
there	1
you	1
d	1
hardly	1
believe	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight	1
I	1
d	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
dressing	1
gown	1
and	1
given	1
up	1
dressing	1
for	1
dinner	1
Needn	1
t	1
say	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
thoughts	1
left	1
for	1
pretty	1
women	1
I	1
became	1
quite	1
an	1
old	1
gentleman	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
I	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
Paris	1
I	1
was	1
as	1
right	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
exactly	1
the	1
difference	1
that	1
Pyotr	1
Oblonsky	1
described	1
In	1
Moscow	1
he	1
degenerated	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
for	1
long	1
together	1
he	1
might	1
in	1
good	1
earnest	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
considering	1
his	1
salvation	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
again	1
Between	1
Princess	1
Betsy	1
Tverskaya	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
there	1
had	1
long	1
existed	1
rather	1
curious	1
relations	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
always	1
flirted	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
jest	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
also	1
in	1
jest	1
the	1
most	1
unseemly	1
things	1
knowing	1
that	1
nothing	1
delighted	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
Karenin	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
felt	1
so	1
youthful	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
jesting	1
flirtation	1
and	1
nonsense	1
he	1
recklessly	1
went	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
extricate	1
himself	1
as	1
unluckily	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
attracted	1
by	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
positively	1
disagreeable	1
What	1
made	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
attractive	1
to	1
her	1
So	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considerably	1
relieved	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
which	1
cut	1
short	1
their	1

Ah	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
here	1
said	1
she	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
poor	1
sister	1
You	1
needn	1
t	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
added	1
Ever	1
since	1
they	1
ve	1
all	1
turned	1
against	1
her	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
re	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
worse	1
than	1
she	1
I	1
ve	1
thought	1
she	1
did	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
forgive	1
Vronsky	1
for	1
not	1
letting	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
d	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
gone	1
about	1
with	1
her	1
everywhere	1
Please	1
give	1
her	1
my	1
love	1
Come	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
her	1
Yes	1
her	1
position	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
she	1
began	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
accepting	1
as	1
sterling	1
coin	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
s	1
words	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
her	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
interrupted	1
him	1
immediately	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
herself	1
She	1
s	1
done	1
what	1
they	1
all	1
do	1
except	1
me	1
only	1
they	1
hide	1
it	1
But	1
she	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
deceitful	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
And	1
she	1
did	1
better	1
still	1
in	1
throwing	1
up	1
that	1
crazy	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
yours	1
You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
Everybody	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
clever	1
so	1
very	1
clever	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
fool	1
Now	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
so	1
thick	1
with	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
and	1
Landau	1
they	1
all	1
say	1
he	1
s	1
crazy	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
prefer	1
not	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
everybody	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
Oh	1
do	1
please	1
explain	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
Yesterday	1
I	1
was	1
seeing	1
him	1
on	1
my	1
sister	1
s	1
behalf	1
and	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
final	1
answer	1
He	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
But	1
this	1
morning	1
instead	1
of	1
an	1
answer	1
I	1
received	1
an	1
invitation	1
from	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
for	1
this	1
evening	1
Ah	1
so	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
said	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
gleefully	1
they	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
Landau	1
what	1
he	1
s	1
to	1
say	1
Ask	1
Landau	1
What	1
for	1
Who	1
or	1
what	1
s	1
Landau	1
What	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
Jules	1
Landau	1
le	1
fameux	1
Jules	1
Landau	1
le	1
clairvoyant	1
He	1
s	1
crazy	1
too	1
but	1
on	1
him	1
your	1
sister	1
s	1
fate	1
depends	1
See	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
provinces	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
anything	1
Landau	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
was	1
a	1
commis	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
in	1
Paris	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
doctor	1
s	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
doctor	1
s	1
waiting	1
room	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sleep	1
he	1
began	1
giving	1
advice	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
patients	1
And	1
wonderful	1
advice	1
it	1
was	1
Then	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Yury	1
Meledinsky	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
invalid	1
heard	1
of	1
this	1
Landau	1
and	1
had	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
husband	1
And	1
he	1
cured	1
her	1
husband	1
though	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
he	1
did	1
him	1
much	1
good	1
for	1
he	1
s	1
just	1
as	1
feeble	1
a	1
creature	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
they	1
believed	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Russia	1
Here	1
there	1
s	1
been	1
a	1
general	1
rush	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
s	1
begun	1
doctoring	1
everyone	1
He	1
cured	1
Countess	1
Bezzubova	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
such	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
adopted	1
him	1
Adopted	1
him	1
Yes	1
as	1
her	1
son	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
Landau	1
any	1
more	1
now	1
but	1
Count	1
Bezzubov	1
That	1
s	1
neither	1
here	1
nor	1
there	1
though	1
but	1
Lidia	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
screw	1
loose	1
somewhere	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
this	1
Landau	1
now	1
and	1
nothing	1
is	1
settled	1
now	1
in	1
her	1
house	1
or	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
s	1
without	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
your	1
sister	1
s	1
fate	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Landau	1
alias	1
Count	1

Chapter	1
21	1
After	1
a	1
capital	1
dinner	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
cognac	1
drunk	1
at	1
Bartnyansky	1
s	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
than	1
the	1
appointed	1
time	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
Who	1
else	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
countess	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
asked	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
as	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
familiar	1
overcoat	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
a	1
queer	1
rather	1
artless	1
looking	1
overcoat	1
with	1
clasps	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Karenin	1
and	1
Count	1
Bezzubov	1
the	1
porter	1
answered	1
severely	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
guessed	1
right	1
thought	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
upstairs	1
Curious	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
well	1
though	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
has	1
immense	1
influence	1
If	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Pomorsky	1
the	1
thing	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
certainty	1
It	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
light	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
but	1
in	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
blinds	1
were	1
drawn	1
and	1
the	1
lamps	1
lighted	1
At	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
under	1
a	1
lamp	1
sat	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
talking	1
softly	1
A	1
short	1
thinnish	1
man	1
very	1
pale	1
and	1
handsome	1
with	1
feminine	1
hips	1
and	1
knock	1
kneed	1
legs	1
with	1
fine	1
brilliant	1
eyes	1
and	1
long	1
hair	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
collar	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
portraits	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
After	1
greeting	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
glancing	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
unknown	1
man	1
Monsieur	1
Landau	1
the	1
countess	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
softness	1
and	1
caution	1
that	1
impressed	1
Oblonsky	1
And	1
she	1
introduced	1
them	1
Landau	1
looked	1
round	1
hurriedly	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
smiling	1
laid	1
his	1
moist	1
lifeless	1
hand	1
in	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
immediately	1
walked	1
away	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
portraits	1
again	1
The	1
countess	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
significantly	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
particularly	1
today	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
pointing	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
Karenin	1
I	1
introduced	1
you	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
Landau	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
voice	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
again	1
immediately	1
after	1
at	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
Count	1
Bezzubov	1
as	1
you	1
re	1
probably	1
aware	1
Only	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
title	1
Yes	1
I	1
heard	1
so	1
answered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
completely	1
cured	1
Countess	1
Bezzubova	1
She	1
was	1
here	1
today	1
poor	1
thing	1
the	1
countess	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
This	1
separation	1
is	1
awful	1
for	1
her	1
It	1
s	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
to	1
her	1
And	1
he	1
positively	1
is	1
going	1
queried	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
Yes	1
he	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
Paris	1
He	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
yesterday	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
looking	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Ah	1
a	1
voice	1
repeated	1
Oblonsky	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
circumspect	1
as	1
he	1
possibly	1
could	1
in	1
this	1
society	1
where	1
something	1
peculiar	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
or	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
key	1
A	1
moment	1
s	1
silence	1
followed	1
after	1
which	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
as	1
though	1
approaching	1
the	1
main	1
topic	1
of	1
conversation	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
smile	1
to	1
Oblonsky	1
I	1
ve	1
known	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
and	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
closer	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
you	1
Les	1
amis	1
de	1
nos	1
amis	1
sont	1
nos	1
amis	1
	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
one	1
must	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
spiritual	1
state	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
friend	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
doing	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
You	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
she	1
said	1
lifting	1
her	1
fine	1
pensive	1
eyes	1
In	1
part	1
countess	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
Having	1
no	1
clear	1
idea	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
about	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
confine	1
himself	1
to	1
generalities	1
The	1
change	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
external	1
position	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
said	1
sternly	1
following	1
with	1
eyes	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
Landau	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
changed	1
a	1
new	1
heart	1
has	1
been	1
vouchsafed	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
fully	1
apprehend	1
the	1
change	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
him	1
Oh	1
well	1
in	1
general	1
outlines	1
I	1
can	1
conceive	1
the	1
change	1
We	1
have	1
always	1
been	1
friendly	1
and	1
now	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
responding	1
with	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
glance	1
to	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
mentally	1
balancing	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ministers	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
intimate	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
about	1
which	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
him	1
The	1
change	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
him	1
cannot	1
lessen	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
neighbors	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
that	1
change	1
can	1
only	1
intensify	1
love	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
me	1
Won	1
t	1
you	1
have	1
some	1
tea	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
indicating	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
was	1
handing	1
round	1
tea	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
Not	1
quite	1
countess	1
Of	1
course	1
his	1
misfortune	1
Yes	1
a	1
misfortune	1
which	1
has	1
proved	1
the	1
highest	1
happiness	1
when	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
made	1
new	1
was	1
filled	1
full	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
gazing	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
at	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
I	1
might	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
thought	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Oh	1
of	1
course	1
countess	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
I	1
imagine	1
such	1
changes	1
are	1
a	1
matter	1
so	1
private	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
them	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
speak	1
freely	1
and	1
help	1
one	1
another	1
Yes	1
undoubtedly	1
so	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
convictions	1
and	1
besides	1
said	1
Oblonsky	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
smile	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
holy	1
truth	1
Oh	1
no	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
and	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
paused	1
in	1
confusion	1
He	1
understood	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
religion	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
will	1
fall	1
asleep	1
immediately	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
looked	1
round	1
Landau	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
and	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
his	1
head	1
drooping	1
Noticing	1
that	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
on	1
him	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
smiled	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
childlike	1
artlessness	1
Don	1
t	1
take	1
any	1
notice	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
and	1
she	1
lightly	1
moved	1
a	1
chair	1
up	1
for	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
I	1
have	1
observed	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
when	1
a	1
footman	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
rapidly	1
ran	1
her	1
eyes	1
over	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
excusing	1
herself	1
wrote	1
an	1
answer	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
rapidity	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
I	1
have	1
observed	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
that	1
Moscow	1
people	1
especially	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
more	1
indifferent	1
to	1
religion	1
than	1
anyone	1
Oh	1
no	1
countess	1
I	1
thought	1
Moscow	1
people	1
had	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
firmest	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
answered	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
But	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
you	1
are	1
unfortunately	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
indifferent	1
ones	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
turning	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
weary	1
smile	1
How	1
anyone	1
can	1
be	1
indifferent	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
indifferent	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
waiting	1
in	1
suspense	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
with	1
his	1
most	1
deprecating	1
smile	1
I	1
hardly	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
such	1
questions	1
has	1
come	1
yet	1
for	1
me	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
We	1
can	1
never	1
tell	1
whether	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
for	1
us	1
or	1
not	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
severely	1
We	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
whether	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
or	1
not	1
ready	1
God	1
s	1
grace	1
is	1
not	1
guided	1
by	1
human	1
considerations	1
sometimes	1
it	1
comes	1
not	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
strive	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
comes	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
unprepared	1
like	1
Saul	1
No	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
just	1
yet	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
meanwhile	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
Landau	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
Do	1
you	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
listen	1
he	1
asked	1
Oh	1
yes	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
disturb	1
you	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
gazing	1
tenderly	1
at	1
him	1
sit	1
here	1
with	1
us	1
One	1
has	1
only	1
not	1
to	1
close	1
one	1
s	1
eyes	1
to	1
shut	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
went	1
on	1
Ah	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
the	1
happiness	1
we	1
know	1
feeling	1
His	1
presence	1
ever	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
smile	1
But	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
feel	1
himself	1
unworthy	1
sometimes	1
to	1
rise	1
to	1
that	1
height	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
conscious	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
in	1
admitting	1
this	1
religious	1
height	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
unable	1
to	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
his	1
free	1
thinking	1
views	1
before	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
to	1
Pomorsky	1
might	1
procure	1
him	1
the	1
coveted	1
appointment	1
That	1
is	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
sin	1
keeps	1
him	1
back	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
false	1
idea	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
sin	1
for	1
believers	1
their	1
sin	1
has	1
been	1
atoned	1
for	1
Pardon	1
	1
she	1
added	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
again	1
with	1
another	1
letter	1
She	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
verbal	1
answer	1
Tomorrow	1
at	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duchess	1
s	1
say	1
For	1
the	1
believer	1
sin	1
is	1
not	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
Yes	1
but	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
recalling	1
the	1
phrase	1
from	1
the	1
catechism	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
smile	1
clinging	1
to	1
his	1
independence	1
There	1
you	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
epistle	1
of	1
St	1
James	1
said	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
addressing	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
reproachfulness	1
in	1
his	1
tone	1
It	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
a	1
subject	1
they	1
had	1
discussed	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
before	1
What	1
harm	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
false	1
interpretation	1
of	1
that	1
passage	1
Nothing	1
holds	1
men	1
back	1
from	1
belief	1
like	1
that	1
misinterpretation	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
works	1
so	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
said	1
But	1
the	1
very	1
opposite	1
is	1
said	1
Striving	1
for	1
God	1
saving	1
the	1
soul	1
by	1
fasting	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
with	1
disgusted	1
contempt	1
those	1
are	1
the	1
crude	1
ideas	1
of	1
our	1
monks	1
Yet	1
that	1
is	1
nowhere	1
said	1
It	1
is	1
far	1
simpler	1
and	1
easier	1
she	1
added	1
looking	1
at	1
Oblonsky	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
encouraging	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
at	1
court	1
she	1
encouraged	1
youthful	1
maids	1
of	1
honor	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
surroundings	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
We	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
Christ	1
who	1
suffered	1
for	1
us	1
We	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
faith	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
chimed	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
of	1
approval	1
at	1
her	1
words	1
	1
Vous	1
comprenez	1
l	1
anglais	1
	1
asked	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
and	1
receiving	1
a	1
reply	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
shelf	1
of	1
books	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
read	1
him	1
Safe	1
and	1
Happy	1
or	1
Under	1
the	1
Wing	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
Karenin	1
And	1
finding	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
she	1
opened	1
it	1
It	1
s	1
very	1
short	1
In	1
it	1
is	1
described	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
faith	1
can	1
be	1
reached	1
and	1
the	1
happiness	1
above	1
all	1
earthly	1
bliss	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
fills	1
the	1
soul	1
The	1
believer	1
cannot	1
be	1
unhappy	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
alone	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
She	1
was	1
just	1
settling	1
herself	1
to	1
read	1
when	1
the	1
footman	1
came	1
in	1
again	1
Madame	1
Borozdina	1
Tell	1
her	1
tomorrow	1
at	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
Yes	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
her	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
gazing	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
fine	1
pensive	1
eyes	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
true	1
faith	1
acts	1
You	1
know	1
Marie	1
Sanina	1
You	1
know	1
about	1
her	1
trouble	1
She	1
lost	1
her	1
only	1
child	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
despair	1
And	1
what	1
happened	1
She	1
found	1
this	1
comforter	1
and	1
she	1
thanks	1
God	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
child	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
happiness	1
faith	1
brings	1
Oh	1
yes	1
that	1
is	1
most	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
glad	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
collect	1
his	1
faculties	1
No	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
ask	1
her	1
about	1
anything	1
today	1
he	1
thought	1
If	1
only	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
without	1
putting	1
my	1
foot	1
in	1
it	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
dull	1
for	1
you	1
said	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
addressing	1
Landau	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
English	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
short	1
Oh	1
I	1
shall	1
understand	1
said	1
Landau	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile	1
and	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
exchanged	1
meaningful	1
glances	1
and	1
the	1
reading	1
began	1
Chapter	1
22	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
completely	1
nonplussed	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
talk	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
hearing	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
The	1
complexity	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
had	1
a	1
stimulating	1
effect	1
on	1
him	1
rousing	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
Moscow	1
stagnation	1
But	1
he	1
liked	1
these	1
complications	1
and	1
understood	1
them	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
circles	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
In	1
these	1
unfamiliar	1
surroundings	1
he	1
was	1
puzzled	1
and	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
bearings	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
artless	1
or	1
perhaps	1
artful	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
decide	1
which	1
eyes	1
of	1
Landau	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
heaviness	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
The	1
most	1
incongruous	1
ideas	1
were	1
in	1
confusion	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
Marie	1
Sanina	1
is	1
glad	1
her	1
child	1
s	1
dead	1
How	1
good	1
a	1
smoke	1
would	1
be	1
now	1
To	1
be	1
saved	1
one	1
need	1
only	1
believe	1
and	1
the	1
monks	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
thing	1
s	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
does	1
know	1
And	1
why	1
is	1
my	1
head	1
so	1
heavy	1
Is	1
it	1
the	1
cognac	1
or	1
all	1
this	1
being	1
so	1
queer	1
Anyway	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
ve	1
done	1
nothing	1
unsuitable	1
so	1
far	1
But	1
anyway	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
do	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
now	1
They	1
say	1
they	1
make	1
one	1
say	1
one	1
s	1
prayers	1
I	1
only	1
hope	1
they	1
won	1
t	1
make	1
me	1
That	1
ll	1
be	1
too	1
imbecile	1
And	1
what	1
stuff	1
it	1
is	1
she	1
s	1
reading	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
good	1
accent	1
Landau	1
Bezzubov	1
what	1
s	1
he	1
Bezzubov	1
for	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
was	1
uncontrollably	1
forming	1
a	1
yawn	1
He	1
pulled	1
his	1
whiskers	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
yawn	1
and	1
shook	1
himself	1
together	1
But	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dropping	1
asleep	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
of	1
snoring	1
He	1
recovered	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
was	1
saying	1
he	1
s	1
asleep	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
started	1
with	1
dismay	1
feeling	1
guilty	1
and	1
caught	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
reassured	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
s	1
asleep	1
referred	1
not	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
Landau	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
asleep	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
But	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
being	1
asleep	1
would	1
have	1
offended	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
though	1
even	1
this	1
he	1
thought	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
as	1
everything	1
seemed	1
so	1
queer	1
while	1
Landau	1
s	1
being	1
asleep	1
delighted	1
them	1
extremely	1
especially	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
	1
Mon	1
ami	1
	1
said	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
carefully	1
holding	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
silk	1
gown	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
rustle	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
excitement	1
calling	1
Karenin	1
not	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
but	1
	1
mon	1
ami	1
donnez	1
lui	1
la	1

Vous	1

	1
Sh	1
she	1
hissed	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
again	1
Not	1
at	1
home	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
was	1
asleep	1
or	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
his	1
moist	1
hand	1
as	1
it	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
knee	1
made	1
faint	1
movements	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
to	1
catch	1
something	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
got	1
up	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
carefully	1
but	1
stumbled	1
against	1
the	1
table	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
s	1
hand	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
got	1
up	1
too	1
and	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
wide	1
trying	1
to	1
wake	1
himself	1
up	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
asleep	1
he	1
looked	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
real	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
getting	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
Que	1

Qu	1

	1
articulated	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
without	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes	1
Vous	1

excuserez	1
mais	1
vous	1
voyez	1

	1
repeated	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
impatiently	1
C	1
est	1
moi	1
n	1
est	1
ce	1
pas	1
	1
And	1
receiving	1
an	1
answer	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
forgetting	1
the	1
favor	1
he	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
and	1
forgetting	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
affairs	1
caring	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
desire	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
as	1
though	1
from	1
a	1
plague	1
stricken	1
house	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
chatted	1
and	1
joked	1
with	1
his	1
cab	1
driver	1
trying	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
spirits	1
At	1
the	1
French	1
theater	1
where	1
he	1
arrived	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
act	1
and	1
afterwards	1
at	1
the	1
Tatar	1
restaurant	1
after	1
his	1
champagne	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
refreshed	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
felt	1
quite	1
unlike	1
himself	1
all	1
that	1
evening	1
On	1
getting	1
home	1
to	1
Pyotr	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
staying	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
found	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Betsy	1
She	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
finish	1
their	1
interrupted	1
conversation	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
next	1
day	1
He	1
had	1
scarcely	1
read	1
this	1
note	1
and	1
frowned	1
at	1
its	1
contents	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
below	1
the	1
ponderous	1
tramp	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
carrying	1
something	1
heavy	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
rejuvenated	1
Pyotr	1
Oblonsky	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
drunk	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
upstairs	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
legs	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
and	1
clinging	1
to	1
him	1
walked	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
there	1
began	1
telling	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
doing	1
so	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
low	1
spirits	1
which	1
happened	1
rarely	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
Everything	1
he	1
could	1
recall	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
everything	1
was	1
disgusting	1
but	1
most	1
disgusting	1
of	1
all	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
shameful	1
was	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
at	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
s	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
a	1
final	1
answer	1
refusing	1
to	1
grant	1
Anna	1
s	1
divorce	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
decision	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
what	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
real	1
or	1
pretended	1
trance	1
Chapter	1
23	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
carry	1
through	1
any	1
undertaking	1
in	1
family	1
life	1
there	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
either	1
complete	1
division	1
between	1
the	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
or	1
loving	1
agreement	1
When	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
a	1
couple	1
are	1
vacillating	1
and	1
neither	1
one	1
thing	1
nor	1
the	1
other	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
enterprise	1
can	1
be	1
undertaken	1
Many	1
families	1
remain	1
for	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
though	1
both	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
are	1
sick	1
of	1
it	1
simply	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
complete	1
division	1
nor	1
agreement	1
between	1
them	1
Both	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
Anna	1
felt	1
life	1
in	1
Moscow	1
insupportable	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
and	1
dust	1
when	1
the	1
spring	1
sunshine	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
summer	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
boulevards	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
in	1
full	1
leaf	1
and	1
the	1
leaves	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
dust	1
But	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
arranged	1
to	1
do	1
long	1
before	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
staying	1
in	1
Moscow	1
though	1
they	1
both	1
loathed	1
it	1
because	1
of	1
late	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
agreement	1
between	1
them	1
The	1
irritability	1
that	1
kept	1
them	1
apart	1
had	1
no	1
external	1
cause	1
and	1
all	1
efforts	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
understanding	1
intensified	1
it	1
instead	1
of	1
removing	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
inner	1
irritation	1
grounded	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
his	1
love	1
had	1
grown	1
less	1
in	1
his	1
on	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
himself	1
for	1
her	1
sake	1
in	1
a	1
difficult	1
position	1
which	1
she	1
instead	1
of	1
lightening	1
made	1
still	1
more	1
difficult	1
Neither	1
of	1
them	1
gave	1
full	1
utterance	1
to	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
grievance	1
but	1
they	1
considered	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
and	1
tried	1
on	1
every	1
pretext	1
to	1
prove	1
this	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
In	1
her	1
eyes	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
habits	1
ideas	1
desires	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
spiritual	1
and	1
physical	1
temperament	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
love	1
for	1
women	1
and	1
that	1
love	1
she	1
felt	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
concentrated	1
on	1
her	1
alone	1
That	1
love	1
was	1
less	1
consequently	1
as	1
she	1
reasoned	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
transferred	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
to	1
other	1
women	1
or	1
to	1
another	1
woman	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
She	1
was	1
jealous	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
woman	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
decrease	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
Not	1
having	1
got	1
an	1
object	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
it	1
At	1
the	1
slightest	1
hint	1
she	1
transferred	1
her	1
jealousy	1
from	1
one	1
object	1
to	1
another	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
those	1
low	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
so	1
easily	1
renew	1
his	1
old	1
bachelor	1
ties	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
women	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
then	1
she	1
was	1
jealous	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
want	1
to	1
marry	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
he	1
would	1
break	1
with	1
her	1
And	1
this	1
last	1
form	1
of	1
jealousy	1
tortured	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
unwarily	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
frankness	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
him	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
audacity	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
young	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
And	1
being	1
jealous	1
of	1
him	1
Anna	1
was	1
indignant	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
found	1
grounds	1
for	1
indignation	1
in	1
everything	1
For	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
difficult	1
in	1
her	1
position	1
she	1
blamed	1
him	1
The	1
agonizing	1
condition	1
of	1
suspense	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
in	1
Moscow	1
the	1
tardiness	1
and	1
indecision	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
her	1
solitude	1
she	1
put	1
it	1
all	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
rescued	1
her	1
from	1
it	1
For	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
blame	1
too	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
do	1
He	1
must	1
have	1
society	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
this	1
awful	1
position	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
And	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
fault	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
forever	1
separated	1
from	1
her	1
son	1
Even	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
of	1
tenderness	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
did	1
not	1
soothe	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
tenderness	1
now	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
complacency	1
of	1
self	1
confidence	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
which	1
exasperated	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
dusk	1
Anna	1
was	1
alone	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
bachelor	1
dinner	1
She	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
noise	1
from	1
the	1
street	1
was	1
least	1
heard	1
and	1
thought	1
over	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
their	1
yesterday	1
s	1
quarrel	1
Going	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
remembered	1
offensive	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
quarrel	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
arrived	1
at	1
last	1
at	1
its	1
origin	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
their	1
dissension	1
had	1
arisen	1
from	1
a	1
conversation	1
so	1
inoffensive	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
moment	1
to	1
either	1
But	1
so	1
it	1
actually	1
had	1
been	1
It	1
all	1
arose	1
from	1
his	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
girls	1
high	1
schools	1
declaring	1
they	1
were	1
useless	1
while	1
she	1
defended	1
them	1
He	1
had	1
spoken	1
slightingly	1
of	1
women	1
s	1
education	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
Hannah	1
Anna	1
s	1
English	1
prot'eg'ee	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
need	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
physics	1
This	1
irritated	1
Anna	1
She	1
saw	1
in	1
this	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
reference	1
to	1
her	1
occupations	1
And	1
she	1
bethought	1
her	1
of	1
a	1
phrase	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
understand	1
me	1
my	1
feelings	1
as	1
anyone	1
who	1
loved	1
me	1
might	1
but	1
simple	1
delicacy	1
I	1
did	1
expect	1
she	1
said	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
flushed	1
with	1
vexation	1
and	1
had	1
said	1
something	1
unpleasant	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
recall	1
her	1
answer	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
point	1
with	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
desire	1
to	1
wound	1
her	1
too	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
I	1
feel	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
your	1
infatuation	1
over	1
this	1
girl	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
because	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
s	1
unnatural	1
The	1
cruelty	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
shattered	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
had	1
built	1
up	1
for	1
herself	1
so	1
laboriously	1
to	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
endure	1
her	1
hard	1
life	1
the	1
injustice	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
accused	1
her	1
of	1
affectation	1
of	1
artificiality	1
aroused	1
her	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
s	1
coarse	1
and	1
material	1
is	1
comprehensible	1
and	1
natural	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
yesterday	1
evening	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
quarrel	1
but	1
both	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
quarrel	1
had	1
been	1
smoothed	1
over	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
Today	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
home	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
so	1
lonely	1
and	1
wretched	1
in	1
being	1
on	1
bad	1
terms	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
forget	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
and	1
be	1
reconciled	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
herself	1
and	1
to	1
justify	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
to	1
blame	1
I	1
m	1
irritable	1
I	1
m	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
at	1
peace	1
Unnatural	1
She	1
suddenly	1
recalled	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
had	1
stung	1
her	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
word	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
intent	1
to	1
wound	1
her	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
he	1
meant	1
unnatural	1
not	1
loving	1
my	1
own	1
daughter	1
to	1
love	1
another	1
person	1
s	1
child	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
Seryozha	1
whom	1
I	1
ve	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
him	1
But	1
that	1
wish	1
to	1
wound	1
me	1
No	1
he	1
loves	1
another	1
woman	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
And	1
perceiving	1
that	1
while	1
trying	1
to	1
regain	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
round	1
the	1
same	1
circle	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
round	1
so	1
often	1
before	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
state	1
of	1
exasperation	1
she	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
herself	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
impossible	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
beyond	1
me	1
to	1
control	1
myself	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
began	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
He	1
s	1
truthful	1
he	1
s	1
honest	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
the	1
divorce	1
will	1
come	1
What	1
more	1
do	1
I	1
want	1
I	1
want	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
trust	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
myself	1
Yes	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
in	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
wrong	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
away	1
tomorrow	1
And	1
to	1
escape	1
thinking	1
any	1
more	1
and	1
being	1
overcome	1
by	1
irritability	1
she	1
rang	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
boxes	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
up	1
for	1
packing	1
their	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
At	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
Vronsky	1
came	1
in	1
Chapter	1
24	1
Well	1
was	1
it	1
nice	1
she	1
asked	1
coming	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
penitent	1
and	1
meek	1
expression	1
Just	1
as	1
usual	1
he	1
answered	1
seeing	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
moods	1
He	1
was	1
used	1
by	1
now	1
to	1
these	1
transitions	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
particularly	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
today	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
good	1
humor	1
himself	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
see	1
Come	1
that	1
s	1
good	1
he	1
said	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
boxes	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
Yes	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
drive	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
fine	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
is	1
there	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
desire	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
back	1
directly	1
and	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
it	1
over	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
coat	1
Order	1
some	1
tea	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
mortifying	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
Come	1
that	1
s	1
good	1
as	1
one	1
says	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
it	1
leaves	1
off	1
being	1
naughty	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
mortifying	1
was	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
her	1
penitent	1
and	1
his	1
self	1
confident	1
tone	1
and	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
strife	1
rising	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
again	1
but	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
she	1
conquered	1
it	1
and	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
good	1
humoredly	1
as	1
before	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
partly	1
repeating	1
phrases	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
beforehand	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
her	1
plans	1
for	1
going	1
away	1
You	1
know	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
almost	1
like	1
an	1
inspiration	1
she	1
said	1
Why	1
wait	1
here	1
for	1
the	1
divorce	1
Won	1
t	1
it	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
wait	1
any	1
longer	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
hoping	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
divorce	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
any	1
more	1
influence	1
on	1
my	1
life	1
Do	1
you	1
agree	1
Oh	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
glancing	1
uneasily	1
at	1
her	1
excited	1
face	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
Who	1
was	1
there	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
Vronsky	1
mentioned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
first	1
rate	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
race	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
pleasant	1
enough	1
but	1
in	1
Moscow	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
do	1
anything	1
without	1
something	1
ridicule	1
A	1
lady	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
teacher	1
of	1
swimming	1
to	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Sweden	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
an	1
exhibition	1
of	1
her	1
skill	1
How	1
did	1
she	1
swim	1
asked	1
Anna	1
frowning	1
In	1
an	1
absurd	1
red	1
costume	1
de	1
natation	1
	1
she	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
hideous	1
too	1
So	1
when	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
What	1
an	1
absurd	1
fancy	1
Why	1
did	1
she	1
swim	1
in	1
some	1
special	1
way	1
then	1
said	1
Anna	1
not	1
answering	1
There	1
was	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
awfully	1
stupid	1
Well	1
then	1
when	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
going	1
Anna	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
to	1
drive	1
away	1
some	1
unpleasant	1
idea	1
When	1
Why	1
the	1
sooner	1
the	1
better	1
By	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
ready	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
Yes	1
oh	1
no	1
wait	1
a	1
minute	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
s	1
Sunday	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
maman	1
s	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
embarrassed	1
because	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
name	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
her	1
intent	1
suspicious	1
eyes	1
His	1
embarrassment	1
confirmed	1
her	1
suspicion	1
She	1
flushed	1
hotly	1
and	1
drew	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Sweden	1
s	1
swimming	1
mistress	1
who	1
filled	1
Anna	1
s	1
imagination	1
but	1
the	1
young	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
She	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
near	1
Moscow	1
with	1
Countess	1
Vronskaya	1
Can	1
t	1
you	1
go	1
tomorrow	1
she	1
said	1
Well	1
no	1
The	1
deeds	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
business	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
there	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
answered	1
If	1
so	1
we	1
won	1
t	1
go	1
at	1
all	1
But	1
why	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
later	1
Monday	1
or	1
never	1
What	1
for	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
amazement	1
Why	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
meaning	1
in	1
it	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
meaning	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
because	1
you	1
care	1
nothing	1
for	1
me	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
understand	1
my	1
life	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
cared	1
for	1
here	1
was	1
Hannah	1
You	1
say	1
it	1
s	1
affectation	1
Why	1
you	1
said	1
yesterday	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
my	1
daughter	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
this	1
English	1
girl	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
unnatural	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
natural	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
clear	1
vision	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
was	1
horrified	1
at	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
resolution	1
But	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
own	1
ruin	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
herself	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
herself	1
from	1
proving	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wrong	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
never	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
this	1
sudden	1
passion	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
though	1
you	1
boast	1
of	1
your	1
straightforwardness	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
I	1
never	1
boast	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
tell	1
lies	1
he	1
said	1
slowly	1
restraining	1
his	1
rising	1
anger	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
respect	1
Respect	1
was	1
invented	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
empty	1
place	1
where	1
love	1
should	1
be	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
and	1
more	1
honest	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
No	1
this	1
is	1
becoming	1
unbearable	1
cried	1
Vronsky	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
stopping	1
short	1
facing	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
speaking	1
deliberately	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
try	1
my	1
patience	1
for	1
looking	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
much	1
more	1
but	1
was	1
restraining	1
himself	1
It	1
has	1
limits	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
that	1
she	1
cried	1
looking	1
with	1
terror	1
at	1
the	1
undisguised	1
hatred	1
in	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
his	1
cruel	1
menacing	1
eyes	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
he	1
checked	1
himself	1
I	1
must	1
ask	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
want	1
All	1
I	1
can	1
want	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
desert	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
she	1
said	1
understanding	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
uttered	1
But	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
that	1
s	1
secondary	1
I	1
want	1
love	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
So	1
then	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
She	1
turned	1
towards	1
the	1
door	1
Stop	1
sto	1
op	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
with	1
no	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
gloomy	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
brows	1
though	1
he	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
going	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
lying	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
honorable	1
man	1
Yes	1
and	1
I	1
repeat	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
reproaches	1
me	1
with	1
having	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
recalling	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
still	1
earlier	1
quarrel	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
dishonorable	1
man	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
heartless	1
man	1
Oh	1
there	1
are	1
limits	1
to	1
endurance	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
hastily	1
let	1
go	1
her	1
hand	1
He	1
hates	1
me	1
that	1
s	1
clear	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
without	1
looking	1
round	1
she	1
walked	1
with	1
faltering	1
steps	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
He	1
loves	1
another	1
woman	1
that	1
s	1
even	1
clearer	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
I	1
want	1
love	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
So	1
then	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
She	1
repeated	1
the	1
words	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
ended	1
But	1
how	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair	1
before	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
Thoughts	1
of	1
where	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
now	1
whether	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
up	1
to	1
Dolly	1
or	1
simply	1
alone	1
abroad	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
now	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
final	1
quarrel	1
or	1
whether	1
reconciliation	1
were	1
still	1
possible	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
all	1
her	1
old	1
friends	1
at	1
Petersburg	1
would	1
say	1
of	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
ideas	1
of	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
now	1
after	1
this	1
rupture	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
At	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
some	1
obscure	1
idea	1
that	1
alone	1
interested	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
clear	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
Thinking	1
once	1
more	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
illness	1
after	1
her	1
confinement	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
never	1
left	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
I	1
die	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
Yes	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
idea	1
which	1
alone	1
solved	1
all	1
Yes	1
to	1
die	1
And	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
disgrace	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
and	1
of	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
my	1
awful	1
shame	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
death	1
To	1
die	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
feel	1
remorse	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
will	1
love	1
me	1
he	1
will	1
suffer	1
on	1
my	1
account	1
With	1
the	1
trace	1
of	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
commiseration	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
armchair	1
taking	1
off	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
rings	1
on	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
vividly	1
picturing	1
from	1
different	1
sides	1
his	1
feelings	1
after	1
her	1
death	1
Approaching	1
footsteps	1
his	1
steps	1
distracted	1
her	1
attention	1
As	1
though	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
her	1
rings	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
said	1
softly	1
Anna	1
we	1
ll	1
go	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
I	1
agree	1
to	1
everything	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
urged	1
You	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
herself	1
any	1
longer	1
she	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs	1
Cast	1
me	1
off	1
she	1
articulated	1
between	1
her	1
sobs	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
away	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
ll	1
do	1
more	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
An	1
immoral	1
woman	1
A	1
stone	1
round	1
your	1
neck	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
wretched	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
I	1
ll	1
set	1
you	1
free	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
me	1
you	1
love	1
someone	1
else	1
Vronsky	1
besought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
declared	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
foundation	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
ceased	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
Anna	1
why	1
distress	1
yourself	1
and	1
me	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
kissing	1
her	1
hands	1
There	1
was	1
tenderness	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
she	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
them	1
wet	1
on	1
her	1
hand	1
And	1
instantly	1
Anna	1
s	1
despairing	1
jealousy	1
changed	1
to	1
a	1
despairing	1
passion	1
of	1
tenderness	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him	1

Feeling	1
that	1
the	1
reconciliation	1
was	1
complete	1
Anna	1
set	1
eagerly	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
preparing	1
for	1
their	1
departure	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
settled	1
whether	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
on	1
Monday	1
or	1
Tuesday	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
each	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
Anna	1
packed	1
busily	1
feeling	1
absolutely	1
indifferent	1
whether	1
they	1
went	1
a	1
day	1
earlier	1
or	1
later	1
She	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
over	1
an	1
open	1
box	1
taking	1
things	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual	1
dressed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
see	1
maman	1
she	1
can	1
send	1
me	1
the	1
money	1
by	1
Yegorov	1
And	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
said	1
Though	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
mood	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
pang	1
No	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
ready	1
by	1
then	1
myself	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
reflected	1
so	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
arrange	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
wished	1
No	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
I	1
m	1
coming	1
directly	1
It	1
s	1
only	1
to	1
turn	1
out	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
aren	1
t	1
wanted	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
something	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
frippery	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
Annushka	1
s	1
arms	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
eating	1
his	1
beefsteak	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
You	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
how	1
distasteful	1
these	1
rooms	1
have	1
become	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
coffee	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
more	1
awful	1
than	1
these	1
chambres	1
garnies	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
individuality	1
in	1
them	1
no	1
soul	1
These	1
clocks	1
and	1
curtains	1
and	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
wallpapers	1
they	1
re	1
a	1
nightmare	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
as	1
the	1
promised	1
land	1
You	1
re	1
not	1
sending	1
the	1
horses	1
off	1
yet	1
No	1
they	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
us	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Wilson	1
s	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
dresses	1
to	1
her	1
So	1
it	1
s	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
tomorrow	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
voice	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
face	1
changed	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
valet	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
sign	1
a	1
receipt	1
for	1
a	1
telegram	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
getting	1
a	1
telegram	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
though	1
anxious	1
to	1
conceal	1
something	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
receipt	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
her	1
By	1
tomorrow	1
without	1
fail	1
I	1
will	1
finish	1
it	1
all	1
From	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
telegram	1
she	1
asked	1
not	1
hearing	1
him	1
From	1
Stiva	1
he	1
answered	1
reluctantly	1
Why	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
What	1
secret	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
between	1
Stiva	1
and	1
me	1
Vronsky	1
called	1
the	1
valet	1
back	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
telegram	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
because	1
Stiva	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
passion	1
for	1
telegraphing	1
why	1
telegraph	1
when	1
nothing	1
is	1
settled	1
About	1
the	1
divorce	1
Yes	1
but	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
anything	1
yet	1
He	1
has	1
promised	1
a	1
decisive	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
But	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
read	1
it	1
With	1
trembling	1
hands	1
Anna	1
took	1
the	1
telegram	1
and	1
read	1
what	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
added	1
Little	1
hope	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
everything	1
possible	1
and	1
impossible	1
I	1
said	1
yesterday	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
get	1
or	1
whether	1
I	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
divorce	1
she	1
said	1
flushing	1
crimson	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
necessity	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
So	1
he	1
may	1
hide	1
and	1
does	1
hide	1
his	1
correspondence	1
with	1
women	1
from	1
me	1
she	1
thought	1
Yashvin	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
Voytov	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
s	1
won	1
from	1
Pyevtsov	1
all	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
can	1
pay	1
about	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
No	1
she	1
said	1
irritated	1
by	1
his	1
so	1
obviously	1
showing	1
by	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
subject	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
irritated	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
this	1
news	1
would	1
affect	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
even	1
try	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
you	1
to	1
care	1
as	1
little	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
care	1
about	1
it	1
because	1
I	1
like	1
definiteness	1
he	1
said	1
Definiteness	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
but	1
the	1
love	1
she	1
said	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
irritated	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
cool	1
composure	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
it	1
for	1
My	1
God	1
love	1
again	1
he	1
thought	1
frowning	1
Oh	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
for	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
There	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
That	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
he	1
said	1
You	1
want	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
sake	1
but	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
or	1
not	1
having	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
For	1
your	1
sake	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
s	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
having	1
children	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
dispute	1
and	1
irritation	1
to	1
her	1
His	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
children	1
she	1
interpreted	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
prize	1
her	1
beauty	1
Oh	1
I	1
said	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
Above	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
he	1
repeated	1
frowning	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
pain	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
your	1
irritability	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
indefiniteness	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
Yes	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
laid	1
aside	1
all	1
pretense	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
cold	1
hatred	1
for	1
me	1
is	1
apparent	1
she	1
thought	1
not	1
hearing	1
his	1
words	1
but	1
watching	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
cold	1
cruel	1
judge	1
who	1
looked	1
mocking	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
The	1
cause	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
irritability	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
completely	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
What	1
indefiniteness	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
that	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
understand	1
he	1
interrupted	1
obstinately	1
anxious	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
his	1
thought	1
The	1
indefiniteness	1
consists	1
in	1
your	1
imagining	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
On	1
that	1
score	1
you	1
can	1
set	1
your	1
mind	1
quite	1
at	1
rest	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
she	1
began	1
drinking	1
her	1
coffee	1
She	1
lifted	1
her	1
cup	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
finger	1
held	1
apart	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
After	1
drinking	1
a	1
few	1
sips	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
expression	1
she	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
repelled	1
by	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
her	1
gesture	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
made	1
by	1
her	1
lips	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
what	1
your	1
mother	1
thinks	1
and	1
what	1
match	1
she	1
wants	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
putting	1
the	1
cup	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
shaking	1
hand	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
talking	1
about	1
that	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
And	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
a	1
heartless	1
woman	1
whether	1
she	1
s	1
old	1
or	1
not	1
old	1
your	1
mother	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
Anna	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
disrespectfully	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
A	1
woman	1
whose	1
heart	1
does	1
not	1
tell	1
her	1
where	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
honor	1
lie	1
has	1
no	1
heart	1
I	1
repeat	1
my	1
request	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
disrespectfully	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
whom	1
I	1
respect	1
he	1
said	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
looking	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
Looking	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
his	1
hands	1
she	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
their	1
reconciliation	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
and	1
his	1
passionate	1
caresses	1
There	1
just	1
such	1
caresses	1
he	1
has	1
lavished	1
and	1
will	1
lavish	1
and	1
longs	1
to	1
lavish	1
on	1
other	1
women	1
she	1
thought	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
love	1
your	1
mother	1
That	1
s	1
all	1
talk	1
and	1
talk	1
and	1
talk	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
hatred	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
Even	1
if	1
so	1
you	1
must	1
Must	1
decide	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
decided	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
away	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Yashvin	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Anna	1
greeted	1
him	1
and	1
remained	1
Why	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tempest	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
a	1
turning	1
point	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
fearful	1
consequences	1
why	1
at	1
that	1
minute	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
appearances	1
before	1
an	1
outsider	1
who	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
must	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
But	1
at	1
once	1
quelling	1
the	1
storm	1
within	1
her	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
their	1
guest	1
Well	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on	1
Has	1
your	1
debt	1
been	1
paid	1
you	1
she	1
asked	1
Yashvin	1
Oh	1
pretty	1
fair	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
shan	1
t	1
get	1
it	1
all	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
half	1
And	1
when	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
said	1
Yashvin	1
looking	1
at	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
unmistakably	1
guessing	1
at	1
a	1
quarrel	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
I	1
think	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
You	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
long	1
though	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
s	1
quite	1
decided	1
said	1
Anna	1
looking	1
Vronsky	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
reconciliation	1
Don	1
t	1
you	1
feel	1
sorry	1
for	1
that	1
unlucky	1
Pyevtsov	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
I	1
ve	1
never	1
asked	1
myself	1
the	1
question	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
whether	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
or	1
not	1
You	1
see	1
all	1
my	1
fortune	1
s	1
here	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
breast	1
pocket	1
and	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
wealthy	1
man	1
But	1
today	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
club	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
out	1
a	1
beggar	1
You	1
see	1
whoever	1
sits	1
down	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
shirt	1
to	1
my	1
back	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
I	1
him	1
And	1
so	1
we	1
fight	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
it	1
Well	1
but	1
suppose	1
you	1
were	1
married	1
said	1
Anna	1
how	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
Yashvin	1
laughed	1
That	1
s	1
why	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
married	1
and	1
never	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
And	1
Helsingfors	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
Anna	1
s	1
smiling	1
face	1
Meeting	1
his	1
eyes	1
Anna	1
s	1
face	1
instantly	1
took	1
a	1
coldly	1
severe	1
expression	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
him	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
forgotten	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
Were	1
you	1
really	1
in	1
love	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Yashvin	1
Oh	1
heavens	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
times	1
But	1
you	1
see	1
some	1
men	1
can	1
play	1
but	1
only	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
always	1
lay	1
down	1
their	1
cards	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
a	1
rendezvous	1
comes	1
while	1
I	1
can	1
take	1
up	1
love	1
but	1
only	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
late	1
for	1
my	1
cards	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
That	1
s	1
how	1
I	1
manage	1
things	1
No	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
mean	1
that	1
but	1
the	1
real	1
thing	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
Helsingfors	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
repeat	1
the	1
word	1
used	1
by	1
Vronsky	1
Voytov	1
who	1
was	1
buying	1
the	1
horse	1
came	1
in	1
Anna	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Before	1
leaving	1
the	1
house	1
Vronsky	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
for	1
something	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
but	1
ashamed	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
pretense	1
she	1
looked	1
straight	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
cold	1
eyes	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
she	1
asked	1
in	1
French	1
To	1
get	1
the	1
guarantee	1
for	1
Gambetta	1
I	1
ve	1
sold	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
said	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
words	1
I	1
ve	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
discussing	1
things	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
nothing	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
he	1
thought	1
If	1
she	1
will	1
punish	1
herself	1
tant	1
pis	1
pour	1
elle	1
	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
something	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
suddenly	1
ached	1
with	1
pity	1
for	1
her	1
Eh	1
Anna	1
he	1
queried	1
I	1
said	1
nothing	1
she	1
answered	1
just	1
as	1
coldly	1
and	1
calmly	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
tant	1
pis	1
then	1
he	1
thought	1
feeling	1
cold	1
again	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
out	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
white	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips	1
He	1
even	1
wanted	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
some	1
comforting	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
his	1
legs	1
carried	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
spent	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
maid	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
her	1
Chapter	1
26	1
Never	1
before	1
had	1
a	1
day	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
quarrel	1
Today	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
quarrel	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
open	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
complete	1
coldness	1
Was	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
glanced	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
guarantee	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
see	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
breaking	1
with	1
despair	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
that	1
face	1
of	1
callous	1
composure	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
cold	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
hated	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
another	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
clear	1
And	1
remembering	1
all	1
the	1
cruel	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
Anna	1
supplied	1
too	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
unmistakably	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
exasperated	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
prevent	1
you	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
You	1
can	1
go	1
where	1
you	1
like	1
You	1
were	1
unwilling	1
to	1
be	1
divorced	1
from	1
your	1
husband	1
no	1
doubt	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
Go	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
money	1
I	1
ll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
How	1
many	1
roubles	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
All	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
words	1
that	1
a	1
brutal	1
man	1
could	1
say	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
imagination	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
forgive	1
him	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
actually	1
said	1
them	1
But	1
didn	1
t	1
he	1
only	1
yesterday	1
swear	1
he	1
loved	1
me	1
he	1
a	1
truthful	1
and	1
sincere	1
man	1
Haven	1
t	1
I	1
despaired	1
for	1
nothing	1
many	1
times	1
already	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
afterwards	1
All	1
that	1
day	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
Wilson	1
s	1
which	1
occupied	1
two	1
hours	1
Anna	1
spent	1
in	1
doubts	1
whether	1
everything	1
were	1
over	1
or	1
whether	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
hope	1
of	1
reconciliation	1
whether	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
see	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
She	1
was	1
expecting	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
leaving	1
a	1
message	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
head	1
ached	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
If	1
he	1
comes	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
maid	1
says	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
still	1
If	1
not	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
decide	1
what	1
I	1
m	1
to	1
do	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
rumbling	1
of	1
his	1
carriage	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
his	1
ring	1
his	1
steps	1
and	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
servant	1
he	1
believed	1
what	1
was	1
told	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
more	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
So	1
then	1
everything	1
was	1
over	1
And	1
death	1
rose	1
clearly	1
and	1
vividly	1
before	1
her	1
mind	1
as	1
the	1
sole	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
back	1
love	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
of	1
punishing	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
gaining	1
the	1
victory	1
in	1
that	1
strife	1
which	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
waging	1
with	1
him	1
Now	1
nothing	1
mattered	1
going	1
or	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
Vozdvizhenskoe	1
getting	1
or	1
not	1
getting	1
a	1
divorce	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
all	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
matter	1
The	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
mattered	1
was	1
punishing	1
him	1
When	1
she	1
poured	1
herself	1
out	1
her	1
usual	1
dose	1
of	1
opium	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
drink	1
off	1
the	1
whole	1
bottle	1
to	1
die	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
easy	1
that	1
she	1
began	1
musing	1
with	1
enjoyment	1
on	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
and	1
repent	1
and	1
love	1
her	1
memory	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
She	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
with	1
open	1
eyes	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
burned	1
down	1
candle	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
carved	1
cornice	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
screen	1
that	1
covered	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
while	1
she	1
vividly	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
feel	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
memory	1
to	1
him	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
say	1
such	1
cruel	1
things	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
She	1
has	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
us	1
forever	1
She	1
is	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
screen	1
wavered	1
pounced	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
cornice	1
the	1
whole	1
ceiling	1
other	1
shadows	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
swooped	1
to	1
meet	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
shadows	1
flitted	1
back	1
but	1
then	1
with	1
fresh	1
swiftness	1
they	1
darted	1
forward	1
wavered	1
commingled	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
darkness	1
Death	1
she	1
thought	1
And	1
such	1
horror	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
realize	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
her	1
trembling	1
hands	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
matches	1
and	1
light	1
another	1
candle	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
burned	1
down	1
and	1
gone	1
out	1
No	1
anything	1
only	1
to	1
live	1
Why	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
Why	1
he	1
loves	1
me	1
This	1
has	1
been	1
before	1
and	1
will	1
pass	1
she	1
said	1
feeling	1
that	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
return	1
to	1
life	1
were	1
trickling	1
down	1
her	1
cheeks	1
And	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
her	1
panic	1
she	1
went	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
He	1
was	1
asleep	1
there	1
and	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
holding	1
the	1
light	1
above	1
his	1
face	1
she	1
gazed	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
she	1
loved	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
back	1
tears	1
of	1
tenderness	1
But	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
waked	1
up	1
he	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
cold	1
eyes	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
before	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wrong	1
in	1
his	1
treatment	1
of	1
her	1
Without	1
waking	1
him	1
she	1
went	1
back	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
second	1
dose	1
of	1
opium	1
she	1
fell	1
towards	1
morning	1
into	1
a	1
heavy	1
incomplete	1
sleep	1
during	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
quite	1
lost	1
consciousness	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
was	1
waked	1
by	1
a	1
horrible	1
nightmare	1
which	1
had	1
recurred	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
her	1
dreams	1
even	1
before	1
her	1
connection	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
A	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
unkempt	1
beard	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
bent	1
down	1
over	1
some	1
iron	1
muttering	1
meaningless	1
French	1
words	1
and	1
she	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
did	1
in	1
this	1
nightmare	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
made	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
it	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
peasant	1
was	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
horrible	1
with	1
the	1
iron	1
over	1
her	1
And	1
she	1
waked	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
sweat	1
When	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
veiled	1
in	1
mist	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
quarrel	1
Just	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
several	1
times	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
headache	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
Tomorrow	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
away	1
I	1
must	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
And	1
learning	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
study	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
As	1
she	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
carriage	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
carriage	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
lilac	1
hat	1
was	1
leaning	1
out	1
giving	1
some	1
direction	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell	1
After	1
a	1
parley	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
someone	1
came	1
upstairs	1
and	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
steps	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
passing	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
He	1
went	1
rapidly	1
downstairs	1
Anna	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
steps	1
without	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
The	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
lilac	1
hat	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
parcel	1
Vronsky	1
smiling	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
carriage	1
drove	1
away	1
he	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
upstairs	1
again	1
The	1
mists	1
that	1
had	1
shrouded	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
soul	1
parted	1
suddenly	1
The	1
feelings	1
of	1
yesterday	1
pierced	1
the	1
sick	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
fresh	1
pang	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
now	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
lowered	1
herself	1
by	1
spending	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
She	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
determination	1
That	1
was	1
Madame	1
Sorokina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
They	1
came	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
the	1
deeds	1
from	1
maman	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
get	1
them	1
yesterday	1
How	1
is	1
your	1
head	1
better	1
he	1
said	1
quietly	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
gloomy	1
and	1
solemn	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
She	1
looked	1
silently	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
frowned	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
a	1
letter	1
She	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
deliberately	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
He	1
still	1
might	1
have	1
turned	1
her	1
back	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
silent	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sound	1
audible	1
was	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
the	1
note	1
paper	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
it	1
Oh	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
tomorrow	1
for	1
certain	1
aren	1
t	1
we	1
You	1
but	1
not	1
I	1
she	1
said	1
turning	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
Anna	1
we	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
You	1
but	1
not	1
I	1
she	1
repeated	1
This	1
is	1
getting	1
unbearable	1
You	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
this	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
Frightened	1
by	1
the	1
desperate	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
after	1
her	1
but	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
scowled	1
setting	1
his	1
teeth	1
This	1
vulgar	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
threat	1
of	1
something	1
vague	1
exasperated	1
him	1
I	1
ve	1
tried	1
everything	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
pay	1
attention	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
drive	1
into	1
town	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
signature	1
to	1
the	1
deeds	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
steps	1
about	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
At	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
he	1
merely	1
gave	1
an	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
horse	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
Voytov	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
Then	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
carriage	1
brought	1
round	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
again	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
again	1
and	1
someone	1
was	1
running	1
upstairs	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
valet	1
running	1
up	1
for	1
his	1
gloves	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
gloves	1
without	1
looking	1
and	1
touching	1
the	1
coachman	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
Then	1
without	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
attitude	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
crossed	1
and	1
drawing	1
on	1
his	1
gloves	1
he	1
vanished	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1

Anna	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
statement	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
when	1
the	1
candle	1
had	1
flickered	1
out	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
fearful	1
dream	1
mingling	1
into	1
one	1
filled	1
her	1
heart	1
with	1
cold	1
terror	1
No	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
she	1
cried	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
afraid	1
now	1
of	1
being	1
alone	1
that	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
she	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
Inquire	1
where	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
gone	1
she	1
said	1
The	1
servant	1
answered	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
stable	1
His	1
honor	1
left	1
word	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
cared	1
to	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
carriage	1
would	1
be	1
back	1
immediately	1
Very	1
good	1
Wait	1
a	1
minute	1
I	1
ll	1
write	1
a	1
note	1
at	1
once	1
Send	1
Mihail	1
with	1
the	1
note	1
to	1
the	1
stables	1
Make	1
haste	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
wrote	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
Come	1
back	1
home	1
I	1
must	1
explain	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
come	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
She	1
sealed	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
alone	1
now	1
she	1
followed	1
the	1
servant	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
Why	1
this	1
isn	1

this	1
isn	1
t	1
he	1
Where	1
are	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
his	1
sweet	1
shy	1
smile	1
was	1
her	1
first	1
thought	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
chubby	1
rosy	1
little	1
girl	1
with	1
her	1
black	1
curly	1
hair	1
instead	1
of	1
Seryozha	1
whom	1
in	1
the	1
tangle	1
of	1
her	1
ideas	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
The	1
little	1
girl	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
obstinately	1
and	1
violently	1
battering	1
on	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
cork	1
and	1
staring	1
aimlessly	1
at	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
her	1
pitch	1
black	1
eyes	1
Answering	1
the	1
English	1
nurse	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
tomorrow	1
Anna	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
and	1
began	1
spinning	1
the	1
cork	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
But	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
loud	1
ringing	1
laugh	1
and	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
recalled	1
Vronsky	1
so	1
vividly	1
that	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
restraining	1
her	1
sobs	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
all	1
over	1
No	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
she	1
thought	1
He	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
But	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
explain	1
that	1
smile	1
that	1
excitement	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
explain	1
I	1
will	1
believe	1
If	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
left	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
Twenty	1
minutes	1
had	1
passed	1
By	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
is	1
coming	1
back	1
Not	1
long	1
ten	1
minutes	1
more	1
But	1
what	1
if	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
come	1
No	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
He	1
mustn	1
t	1
see	1
me	1
with	1
tear	1
stained	1
eyes	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
wash	1
Yes	1
yes	1
did	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
hair	1
or	1
not	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
And	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
She	1
felt	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
Yes	1
my	1
hair	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
remember	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
pier	1
glass	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
she	1
really	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
hair	1
She	1
certainly	1
had	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
Who	1
s	1
that	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
at	1
the	1
swollen	1
face	1
with	1
strangely	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
her	1
Why	1
it	1
s	1
I	1
she	1
suddenly	1
understood	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
she	1
seemed	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
feel	1
his	1
kisses	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
twitched	1
her	1
shoulders	1
shuddering	1
Then	1
she	1
lifted	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
kissed	1
it	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
Why	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
her	1
bedroom	1
where	1
Annushka	1
was	1
tidying	1
the	1
room	1
Annushka	1
she	1
said	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
maid	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
You	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
said	1
the	1
girl	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
understood	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
Yes	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
Fifteen	1
minutes	1
there	1
fifteen	1
minutes	1
back	1
He	1
s	1
coming	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
here	1
soon	1
She	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
watch	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
But	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
go	1
away	1
leaving	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
How	1
can	1
he	1
live	1
without	1
making	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
She	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
Judging	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
back	1
now	1
But	1
her	1
calculations	1
might	1
be	1
wrong	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
recall	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
and	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
minutes	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
moved	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
clock	1
to	1
compare	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
watch	1
someone	1
drove	1
up	1
Glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
carriage	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
came	1
upstairs	1
and	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
below	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
messenger	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
She	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
We	1
didn	1
t	1
catch	1
the	1
count	1
The	1
count	1
had	1
driven	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
lower	1
city	1
road	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
What	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1
good	1
humored	1
Mihail	1
as	1
he	1
handed	1
her	1
back	1
her	1
note	1
Why	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
received	1
it	1
she	1
thought	1
Go	1
with	1
this	1
note	1
to	1
Countess	1
Vronskaya	1
s	1
place	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
bring	1
an	1
answer	1
back	1
immediately	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
messenger	1
And	1
I	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
she	1
thought	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
Dolly	1
s	1
that	1
s	1
true	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mind	1
Yes	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
telegraph	1
too	1
And	1
she	1
wrote	1
a	1
telegram	1
I	1
absolutely	1
must	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
After	1
sending	1
off	1
the	1
telegram	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
dress	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
dressed	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
hat	1
she	1
glanced	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
plump	1
comfortable	1
looking	1
Annushka	1
There	1
was	1
unmistakable	1
sympathy	1
in	1
those	1
good	1
natured	1
little	1
gray	1
eyes	1
Annushka	1
dear	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
said	1
Anna	1
sobbing	1
and	1
sinking	1
helplessly	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
Why	1
fret	1
yourself	1
so	1
Anna	1
Arkadyevna	1
Why	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
You	1
drive	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
it	1
ll	1
cheer	1
you	1
up	1
said	1
the	1
maid	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
said	1
Anna	1
rousing	1
herself	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
telegram	1
while	1
I	1
m	1
away	1
send	1
it	1
on	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
s	1
but	1
no	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
back	1
myself	1
Yes	1
I	1
mustn	1
t	1
think	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
drive	1
somewhere	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
she	1
said	1
feeling	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
strange	1
turmoil	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
Where	1
to	1
asked	1

Chapter	1
28	1
It	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
sunny	1
A	1
fine	1
rain	1
had	1
been	1
falling	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
cleared	1
up	1
The	1
iron	1
roofs	1
the	1
flags	1
of	1
the	1
roads	1
the	1
flints	1
of	1
the	1
pavements	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
leather	1
the	1
brass	1
and	1
the	1
tinplate	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
all	1
glistened	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
May	1
sunshine	1
It	1
was	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
liveliest	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
As	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
comfortable	1
carriage	1
that	1
hardly	1
swayed	1
on	1
its	1
supple	1
springs	1
while	1
the	1
grays	1
trotted	1
swiftly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
unceasing	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
changing	1
impressions	1
in	1
the	1
pure	1
air	1
Anna	1
ran	1
over	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
position	1
quite	1
differently	1
from	1
how	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
at	1
home	1
Now	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
death	1
seemed	1
no	1
longer	1
so	1
terrible	1
and	1
so	1
clear	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
death	1
itself	1
no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
so	1
inevitable	1
Now	1
she	1
blamed	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
humiliation	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lowered	1
herself	1
I	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
given	1

Ah	1
the	1

at	1
Mitishtchen	1
and	1
the	1

And	1
she	1
remembered	1
how	1
long	1
long	1
ago	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
seventeen	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
to	1
Troitsa	1
Riding	1
too	1
Was	1
that	1
really	1
me	1
with	1
red	1
hands	1
How	1
much	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
then	1
splendid	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
reach	1
has	1
become	1
worthless	1
while	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
then	1
has	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
reach	1
forever	1
Could	1
I	1
ever	1
have	1
believed	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
such	1
humiliation	1
How	1
conceited	1
and	1
self	1
satisfied	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
gets	1
my	1
note	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
him	1
How	1
horrid	1
that	1

Why	1
is	1

A	1

to	1

It	1
was	1
Annushka	1

husband	1
Our	1

she	1
remembered	1
how	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
Our	1
Why	1
our	1
What	1
s	1
so	1
awful	1
is	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
past	1
by	1
its	1
roots	1
One	1
can	1
t	1
tear	1
it	1
out	1
but	1
one	1
can	1
hide	1
one	1
s	1
memory	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
I	1
ll	1
hide	1
it	1
And	1
then	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
past	1
with	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
blotted	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
Dolly	1
will	1
think	1
I	1
m	1
leaving	1
my	1
second	1
husband	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
certainly	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
As	1
if	1
I	1
cared	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
cry	1
But	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1
wondering	1
what	1
those	1
two	1
girls	1
could	1
be	1
smiling	1
about	1
Love	1
most	1
likely	1
They	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
dreary	1
it	1
is	1
how	1
low	1
The	1

and	1
the	1

And	1
I	1
m	1
losing	1
everything	1
and	1
not	1
getting	1
him	1
back	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
losing	1
everything	1
if	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
return	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
late	1
for	1
the	1
train	1
and	1
has	1
come	1
back	1
by	1
now	1
Longing	1
for	1
humiliation	1
again	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
No	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
Dolly	1
and	1
say	1
straight	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
m	1
unhappy	1
I	1
deserve	1
this	1
I	1
m	1
to	1
blame	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
m	1
unhappy	1
help	1
me	1
These	1

this	1
carriage	1
how	1
loathsome	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
myself	1
in	1
this	1
carriage	1
all	1
his	1
but	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
Thinking	1
over	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
tell	1
Dolly	1
and	1
mentally	1
working	1
her	1
heart	1
up	1
to	1
great	1
bitterness	1
Anna	1
went	1
upstairs	1
Is	1
there	1
anyone	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
Katerina	1

answered	1

footman	1
Kitty	1
Kitty	1
whom	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
thought	1
Anna	1
the	1
girl	1
he	1
thinks	1
of	1
with	1
love	1
He	1
s	1
sorry	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
marry	1
her	1
But	1
me	1
he	1
thinks	1
of	1
with	1
hatred	1
and	1
is	1
sorry	1
he	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
The	1
sisters	1
were	1
having	1
a	1
consultation	1
about	1
nursing	1
when	1
Anna	1
called	1
Dolly	1
went	1
down	1
alone	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
visitor	1
who	1
had	1
interrupted	1
their	1
conversation	1
Well	1
so	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
gone	1
away	1
yet	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Stiva	1
today	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
telegram	1
too	1
answered	1
Anna	1
looking	1
round	1
for	1
Kitty	1
He	1
writes	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
make	1
out	1
quite	1
what	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
wants	1
but	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
go	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
decisive	1
answer	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
had	1
someone	1
with	1
you	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
letter	1
Yes	1
Kitty	1
said	1
Dolly	1
embarrassed	1
She	1
stayed	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
ill	1
So	1
I	1
heard	1
May	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
letter	1
I	1
ll	1
get	1
it	1
directly	1
But	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
refuse	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
Stiva	1
has	1
hopes	1
said	1
Dolly	1
stopping	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
wish	1
it	1
said	1
Anna	1
What	1
s	1
this	1
Does	1
Kitty	1
consider	1
it	1
degrading	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
thought	1
Anna	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
alone	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
s	1
right	1
too	1
But	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
girl	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
received	1
by	1
any	1
decent	1
woman	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
I	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
to	1
him	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
reward	1
Oh	1
how	1
I	1
hate	1
him	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
here	1
for	1
I	1
m	1
worse	1
here	1
more	1
miserable	1
She	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
the	1
sisters	1
voices	1
in	1
consultation	1
And	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
Dolly	1
now	1
Amuse	1
Kitty	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
wretchedness	1
submit	1
to	1
her	1
patronizing	1
No	1
and	1
besides	1
Dolly	1
wouldn	1
t	1
understand	1
And	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
good	1
my	1
telling	1
her	1
It	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
interesting	1
to	1
see	1
Kitty	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
how	1
I	1
despise	1
everyone	1
and	1
everything	1
how	1
nothing	1
matters	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
Dolly	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
Anna	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
back	1
in	1
silence	1
I	1
knew	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
interest	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
Oh	1
why	1
so	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
I	1
have	1
hopes	1
said	1
Dolly	1
looking	1
inquisitively	1
at	1
Anna	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
strangely	1
irritable	1
condition	1
When	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
away	1
she	1
asked	1
Anna	1
half	1
closing	1
her	1
eyes	1
looked	1
straight	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
Why	1
does	1
Kitty	1
shrink	1
from	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
flushing	1
red	1
Oh	1
what	1
nonsense	1
She	1
s	1
nursing	1
and	1
things	1
aren	1
t	1
going	1
right	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
advising	1
her	1
She	1
s	1
delighted	1
She	1
ll	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
said	1
Dolly	1
awkwardly	1
not	1
clever	1
at	1
lying	1
Yes	1
here	1
she	1
is	1
Hearing	1
that	1
Anna	1
had	1
called	1
Kitty	1
had	1
wanted	1
not	1
to	1
appear	1
but	1
Dolly	1
persuaded	1
her	1
Rallying	1
her	1
forces	1
Kitty	1
went	1
in	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
blushing	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
Kitty	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
into	1
confusion	1
by	1
the	1
inward	1
conflict	1
between	1
her	1
antagonism	1
to	1
this	1
bad	1
woman	1
and	1
her	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
nice	1
to	1
her	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
Anna	1
s	1
lovely	1
and	1
attractive	1
face	1
all	1
feeling	1
of	1
antagonism	1
disappeared	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
cared	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
used	1
to	1
everything	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
ill	1
Yes	1
you	1
are	1
changed	1
said	1
Anna	1
Kitty	1
felt	1
that	1
Anna	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
hostile	1
eyes	1
She	1
ascribed	1
this	1
hostility	1
to	1
the	1
awkward	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
Anna	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
patronized	1
her	1
must	1
feel	1
with	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
Kitty	1
s	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
of	1
Stiva	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
nothing	1
interested	1
Anna	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
say	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
getting	1
up	1
Oh	1
when	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
But	1
again	1
not	1
answering	1
Anna	1
turned	1
to	1
Kitty	1
Yes	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
everyone	1
even	1
from	1
your	1
husband	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
liked	1
him	1
exceedingly	1
she	1
said	1
unmistakably	1
with	1
malicious	1
intent	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
He	1
has	1
gone	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
said	1
Kitty	1
blushing	1
Remember	1
me	1
to	1
him	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
do	1
I	1
ll	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
Kitty	1
said	1
na"ively	1
looking	1
compassionately	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
So	1
good	1
bye	1
Dolly	1
And	1
kissing	1
Dolly	1
and	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
Kitty	1
Anna	1
went	1
out	1
hurriedly	1
She	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
charming	1
She	1
s	1
very	1
lovely	1
said	1
Kitty	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
But	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
piteous	1
about	1
her	1
Awfully	1
piteous	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
unusual	1
about	1
her	1
today	1
said	1
Dolly	1
When	1
I	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
I	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
crying	1
Chapter	1
29	1
Anna	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
even	1
worse	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
home	1
To	1
her	1
previous	1
tortures	1
was	1
added	1
now	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
mortification	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
outcast	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
so	1
distinctly	1
on	1
meeting	1
Kitty	1
Where	1
to	1
Home	1
asked	1
Pyotr	1
Yes	1
home	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
even	1
thinking	1
now	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
How	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
as	1
something	1
dreadful	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
curious	1
What	1
can	1
he	1
be	1
telling	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
such	1
warmth	1
she	1
thought	1
staring	1
at	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
walked	1
by	1
Can	1
one	1
ever	1
tell	1
anyone	1
what	1
one	1
is	1
feeling	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
Dolly	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
tell	1
her	1
How	1
pleased	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
my	1
misery	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
concealed	1
it	1
but	1
her	1
chief	1
feeling	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
delight	1
at	1
my	1
being	1
punished	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
she	1
envied	1
me	1
for	1
Kitty	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
even	1
more	1
pleased	1
How	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
through	1
her	1
She	1
knows	1
I	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
sweet	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
And	1
she	1
s	1
jealous	1
and	1
hates	1
me	1
And	1
she	1
despises	1
me	1
In	1
her	1
eyes	1
I	1
m	1
an	1
immoral	1
woman	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
an	1
immoral	1
woman	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
her	1
husband	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
d	1
cared	1
to	1
And	1
indeed	1
I	1
did	1
care	1
to	1
There	1
s	1
someone	1
who	1
s	1
pleased	1
with	1
himself	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
fat	1
rubicund	1
gentleman	1
coming	1
towards	1
her	1
He	1
took	1
her	1
for	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
lifted	1
his	1
glossy	1
hat	1
above	1
his	1
bald	1
glossy	1
head	1
and	1
then	1
perceived	1
his	1
mistake	1
He	1

knew	1

Well	1
he	1
knows	1
me	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
knows	1
me	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
myself	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
appetites	1
as	1
the	1
French	1
say	1
They	1
want	1
that	1
dirty	1
ice	1
cream	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
two	1
boys	1
stopping	1
an	1
ice	1
cream	1
seller	1
who	1
took	1
a	1
barrel	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
wiping	1
his	1
perspiring	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
towel	1
We	1
all	1
want	1
what	1
is	1
sweet	1
and	1
nice	1
If	1
not	1
sweetmeats	1
then	1
a	1
dirty	1
ice	1
And	1
Kitty	1
s	1
the	1
same	1
if	1
not	1
Vronsky	1
then	1
Levin	1
And	1
she	1
envies	1
me	1
and	1
hates	1
me	1
And	1
we	1
all	1
hate	1
each	1
other	1
I	1
Kitty	1
Kitty	1
me	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1

Tiutkin	1
	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
smiled	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
now	1
to	1
tell	1
anything	1
amusing	1
to	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
amusing	1
nothing	1
mirthful	1
really	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
hateful	1
They	1
re	1
singing	1
for	1
vespers	1
and	1
how	1
carefully	1
that	1
merchant	1
crosses	1
himself	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
something	1
Why	1
these	1
churches	1
and	1
this	1
singing	1
and	1
this	1
humbug	1
Simply	1
to	1
conceal	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
hate	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
these	1
cab	1
drivers	1
who	1
are	1
abusing	1
each	1
other	1
so	1
angrily	1
Yashvin	1
says	1
He	1
wants	1
to	1
strip	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
shirt	1
and	1
I	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
truth	1
She	1
was	1
plunged	1
in	1
these	1
thoughts	1
which	1
so	1
engrossed	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
left	1
off	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
position	1
when	1
the	1
carriage	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
her	1
house	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
porter	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
remembered	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
note	1
and	1
the	1
telegram	1
Is	1
there	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
inquired	1
I	1
ll	1
see	1
this	1
minute	1
answered	1
the	1
porter	1
and	1
glancing	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
thin	1
square	1
envelope	1
of	1
a	1
telegram	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
come	1
before	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
Vronsky	1
she	1
read	1
And	1
hasn	1
t	1
the	1
messenger	1
come	1
back	1
No	1
answered	1
the	1
porter	1
Then	1
since	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
feeling	1
a	1
vague	1
fury	1
and	1
craving	1
for	1
revenge	1
rising	1
up	1
within	1
her	1
she	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
I	1
ll	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
myself	1
Before	1
going	1
away	1
forever	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
him	1
all	1
Never	1
have	1
I	1
hated	1
anyone	1
as	1
I	1
hate	1
that	1
man	1
she	1
thought	1
Seeing	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
rack	1
she	1
shuddered	1
with	1
aversion	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
his	1
telegram	1
was	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
telegram	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
received	1
her	1
note	1
She	1
pictured	1
him	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
talking	1
calmly	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
her	1
sufferings	1
Yes	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
quickly	1
she	1
said	1
not	1
knowing	1
yet	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
feelings	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
in	1
that	1
awful	1
house	1
The	1
servants	1
the	1
walls	1
the	1
things	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
all	1
aroused	1
repulsion	1
and	1
hatred	1
in	1
her	1
and	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
weight	1
upon	1
her	1
Yes	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
there	1
then	1
go	1
there	1
and	1
catch	1
him	1
Anna	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
railway	1
timetable	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers	1
An	1
evening	1
train	1
went	1
at	1
two	1
minutes	1
past	1
eight	1
Yes	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
She	1
gave	1
orders	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
packed	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
bag	1
the	1
things	1
needed	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
She	1
knew	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
here	1
again	1
Among	1
the	1
plans	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
vaguely	1
determined	1
that	1
after	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
countess	1
s	1
house	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
town	1
on	1
the	1
Nizhni	1
road	1
and	1
stop	1
there	1
Dinner	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
but	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feel	1
that	1
all	1
food	1
was	1
disgusting	1
She	1
ordered	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
The	1
house	1
threw	1
a	1
shadow	1
now	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
street	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bright	1
evening	1
and	1
still	1
warm	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
Annushka	1
who	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
things	1
and	1
Pyotr	1
who	1
put	1
the	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
evidently	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
were	1
all	1
hateful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
irritated	1
her	1
by	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
you	1
Pyotr	1
But	1
how	1
about	1
the	1
ticket	1
Well	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
doesn	1
t	1
matter	1
she	1
said	1
crossly	1
Pyotr	1
jumped	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo	1
told	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
booking	1
office	1
Chapter	1
30	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
again	1
Again	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
all	1
Anna	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
started	1
and	1
swaying	1
lightly	1
rumbled	1
over	1
the	1
tiny	1
cobbles	1
of	1
the	1
paved	1
road	1
and	1
again	1
one	1
impression	1
followed	1
rapidly	1
upon	1
another	1
Yes	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
so	1
clearly	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
recall	1
it	1
Tiutkin	1
coiffeur	1
	1
no	1
not	1
that	1
Yes	1
of	1
what	1
Yashvin	1
says	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
and	1
hatred	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
holds	1
men	1
together	1
No	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
useless	1
journey	1
you	1
re	1
making	1
she	1
said	1
mentally	1
addressing	1
a	1
party	1
in	1
a	1
coach	1
and	1
four	1
evidently	1
going	1
for	1
an	1
excursion	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
And	1
the	1
dog	1
you	1
re	1
taking	1
with	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
help	1
to	1
you	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
yourselves	1
Turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
Pyotr	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
factory	1
hand	1
almost	1
dead	1
drunk	1
with	1
hanging	1
head	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
policeman	1
Come	1
he	1
s	1
found	1
a	1
quicker	1
way	1
she	1
thought	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
that	1
happiness	1
either	1
though	1
we	1
expected	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
it	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
Anna	1
turned	1
that	1
glaring	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
everything	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
relations	1
with	1
him	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
hitherto	1
avoided	1
thinking	1
about	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
he	1
sought	1
in	1
me	1
Not	1
love	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
vanity	1
She	1
remembered	1
his	1
words	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
that	1
recalled	1
an	1
abject	1
setter	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
connection	1
And	1
everything	1
now	1
confirmed	1
this	1
Yes	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
triumph	1
of	1
success	1
in	1
him	1
Of	1
course	1
there	1
was	1
love	1
too	1
but	1
the	1
chief	1
element	1
was	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
success	1
He	1
boasted	1
of	1
me	1
Now	1
that	1
s	1
over	1
There	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
Not	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
of	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
from	1
me	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
is	1
weary	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
is	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
dishonorable	1
in	1
his	1
behavior	1
to	1
me	1
He	1
let	1
that	1
out	1
yesterday	1
he	1
wants	1
divorce	1
and	1
marriage	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
burn	1
his	1
ships	1
He	1
loves	1
me	1
but	1
how	1
The	1
zest	1
is	1
gone	1
as	1
the	1
English	1
say	1
That	1
fellow	1
wants	1
everyone	1
to	1
admire	1
him	1
and	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
himself	1
she	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
red	1
faced	1
clerk	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
riding	1
school	1
horse	1
Yes	1
there	1
s	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
flavor	1
about	1
me	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
If	1
I	1
go	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
mere	1
supposition	1
she	1
saw	1
it	1
distinctly	1
in	1
the	1
piercing	1
light	1
which	1
revealed	1
to	1
her	1
now	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
human	1
relations	1
My	1
love	1
keeps	1
growing	1
more	1
passionate	1
and	1
egoistic	1
while	1
his	1
is	1
waning	1
and	1
waning	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
we	1
re	1
drifting	1
apart	1
She	1
went	1
on	1
musing	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
He	1
is	1
everything	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
give	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
entirely	1
And	1
he	1
wants	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
We	1
walked	1
to	1
meet	1
each	1
other	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
our	1
love	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
irresistibly	1
drifting	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
And	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
altering	1
that	1
He	1
tells	1
me	1
I	1
m	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
insanely	1
jealous	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
true	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
jealous	1
but	1
I	1
m	1
unsatisfied	1
But	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
shifted	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
in	1
the	1
excitement	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
mistress	1
passionately	1
caring	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
caresses	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
else	1
And	1
by	1
that	1
desire	1
I	1
rouse	1
aversion	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
rouses	1
fury	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
different	1
Don	1
t	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
wouldn	1
t	1
deceive	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
schemes	1
about	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
that	1
he	1
s	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Kitty	1
that	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
desert	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
but	1
it	1
makes	1
it	1
no	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
If	1
without	1
loving	1
me	1
from	1
duty	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
without	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
worse	1
than	1
unkindness	1
That	1
s	1
hell	1
And	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
now	1
he	1
hasn	1
t	1
loved	1
me	1
And	1
where	1
love	1
ends	1
hate	1
begins	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
these	1
streets	1
at	1
all	1
Hills	1
it	1
seems	1
and	1
still	1
houses	1
and	1
houses	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
always	1
people	1
and	1
people	1
How	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
no	1
end	1
and	1
all	1
hating	1
each	1
other	1
Come	1
let	1
me	1
try	1
and	1
think	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
Well	1
Suppose	1
I	1
am	1
divorced	1
and	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
lets	1
me	1
have	1
Seryozha	1
and	1
I	1
marry	1
Vronsky	1
Thinking	1
of	1
Alexey	1
Alexandrovitch	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
pictured	1
him	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
vividness	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
alive	1
before	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
mild	1
lifeless	1
dull	1
eyes	1
the	1
blue	1
veins	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
hands	1
his	1
intonations	1
and	1
the	1
cracking	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
and	1
remembering	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
had	1
existed	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
called	1
love	1
she	1
shuddered	1
with	1
loathing	1
Well	1
I	1
m	1
divorced	1
and	1
become	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
wife	1
Well	1
will	1
Kitty	1
cease	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
today	1
No	1
And	1
will	1
Seryozha	1
leave	1
off	1
asking	1
and	1
wondering	1
about	1
my	1
two	1
husbands	1
And	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
new	1
feeling	1
I	1
can	1
awaken	1
between	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
me	1
Is	1
there	1
possible	1
if	1
not	1
happiness	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
ease	1
from	1
misery	1
No	1
no	1
she	1
answered	1
now	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
hesitation	1
Impossible	1
We	1
are	1
drawn	1
apart	1
by	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
his	1
unhappiness	1
and	1
he	1
mine	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
altering	1
him	1
or	1
me	1
Every	1
attempt	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
the	1
screw	1
has	1
come	1
unscrewed	1
Oh	1
a	1
beggar	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
baby	1
She	1
thinks	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
Aren	1
t	1
we	1
all	1
flung	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
only	1
to	1
hate	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
torture	1
ourselves	1
and	1
each	1
other	1
Schoolboys	1
coming	1
laughing	1
Seryozha	1
she	1
thought	1
I	1
thought	1
too	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
him	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
touched	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
tenderness	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
without	1
him	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
another	1
love	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
regret	1
the	1
exchange	1
till	1
that	1
love	1
was	1
satisfied	1
And	1
with	1
loathing	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
by	1
that	1
love	1
And	1
the	1
clearness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
life	1
now	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
s	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
her	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
Pyotr	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
Fyodor	1
and	1
that	1
merchant	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
living	1
along	1
the	1
Volga	1
where	1
those	1
placards	1
invite	1
one	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
everywhere	1
and	1
always	1
she	1
thought	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
driven	1
under	1
the	1
low	1
pitched	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
Nizhigorod	1
station	1
and	1
the	1
porters	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
A	1
ticket	1
to	1
Obiralovka	1
said	1
Pyotr	1
She	1
had	1
utterly	1
forgotten	1
where	1
and	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
she	1
understood	1
the	1
question	1
Yes	1
she	1
said	1
handing	1
him	1
her	1
purse	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
little	1
red	1
bag	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
she	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
Making	1
her	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
crowd	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
waiting	1
room	1
she	1
gradually	1
recollected	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
her	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
plans	1
between	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
hesitating	1
And	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
sore	1
places	1
hope	1
and	1
then	1
despair	1
poisoned	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
her	1
tortured	1
fearfully	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
As	1
she	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
star	1
shaped	1
sofa	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
train	1
she	1
gazed	1
with	1
aversion	1
at	1
the	1
people	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
hateful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
thought	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
would	1
write	1
him	1
a	1
note	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
complaining	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
of	1
his	1
position	1
not	1
understanding	1
her	1
sufferings	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
Then	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
life	1
might	1
still	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
how	1
miserably	1
she	1
loved	1
and	1
hated	1
him	1
and	1
how	1
fearfully	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
beating	1
Chapter	1
31	1
A	1
bell	1
rang	1
some	1
young	1
men	1
ugly	1
and	1
impudent	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
careful	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
hurried	1
by	1
Pyotr	1
too	1
crossed	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
livery	1
and	1
top	1
boots	1
with	1
his	1
dull	1
animal	1
face	1
and	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
train	1
Some	1
noisy	1
men	1
were	1
quiet	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
one	1
whispered	1
something	1
about	1
her	1
to	1
another	1
something	1
vile	1
no	1
doubt	1
She	1
stepped	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
step	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
by	1
herself	1
on	1
a	1
dirty	1
seat	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
white	1
Her	1
bag	1
lay	1
beside	1
her	1
shaken	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
springiness	1
of	1
the	1
seat	1
With	1
a	1
foolish	1
smile	1
Pyotr	1
raised	1
his	1
hat	1
with	1
its	1
colored	1
band	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
farewell	1
an	1
impudent	1
conductor	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
latch	1
A	1
grotesque	1
looking	1
lady	1
wearing	1
a	1
bustle	1
Anna	1
mentally	1
undressed	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
was	1
appalled	1
at	1
her	1
hideousness	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
girl	1
laughing	1
affectedly	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
platform	1
Katerina	1
Andreevna	1
she	1
s	1
got	1
them	1
all	1
ma	1
tante	1
	1
cried	1
the	1
girl	1
Even	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
hideous	1
and	1
affected	1
thought	1
Anna	1
To	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
anyone	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
quickly	1
and	1
seated	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
carriage	1
A	1
misshapen	1
looking	1
peasant	1
covered	1
with	1
dirt	1
in	1
a	1
cap	1
from	1
which	1
his	1
tangled	1
hair	1
stuck	1
out	1
all	1
round	1
passed	1
by	1
that	1
window	1
stooping	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
There	1
s	1
something	1
familiar	1
about	1
that	1
hideous	1
peasant	1
thought	1
Anna	1
And	1
remembering	1
her	1
dream	1
she	1
moved	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
door	1
shaking	1
with	1
terror	1
The	1
conductor	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
let	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
Anna	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
The	1
conductor	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
fellow	1
passengers	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
under	1
her	1
veil	1
her	1
panic	1
stricken	1
face	1
She	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
corner	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
The	1
couple	1
seated	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
and	1
intently	1
but	1
surreptitiously	1
scrutinized	1
her	1
clothes	1
Both	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
seemed	1
repulsive	1
to	1
Anna	1
The	1
husband	1
asked	1
would	1
she	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
smoke	1
obviously	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
smoking	1
but	1
to	1
getting	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
Receiving	1
her	1
assent	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
French	1
something	1
about	1
caring	1
less	1
to	1
smoke	1
than	1
to	1
talk	1
They	1
made	1
inane	1
and	1
affected	1
remarks	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
entirely	1
for	1
her	1
benefit	1
Anna	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sick	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
hated	1
each	1
other	1
And	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
helped	1
hating	1
such	1
miserable	1
monstrosities	1
A	1
second	1
bell	1
sounded	1
and	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
moving	1
of	1
luggage	1
noise	1
shouting	1
and	1
laughter	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
clear	1
to	1
Anna	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
that	1
this	1
laughter	1
irritated	1
her	1
agonizingly	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
stop	1
up	1
her	1
ears	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
third	1
bell	1
rang	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whistle	1
and	1
a	1
hiss	1
of	1
steam	1
and	1
a	1
clank	1
of	1
chains	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
her	1
carriage	1
crossed	1
himself	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
interesting	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
meaning	1
he	1
attaches	1
to	1
that	1
thought	1
Anna	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
him	1
She	1
looked	1
past	1
the	1
lady	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
seemed	1
whirling	1
by	1
as	1
they	1
ran	1
beside	1
the	1
train	1
or	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
The	1
train	1
jerking	1
at	1
regular	1
intervals	1
at	1
the	1
junctions	1
of	1
the	1
rails	1
rolled	1
by	1
the	1
platform	1
past	1
a	1
stone	1
wall	1
a	1
signal	1
box	1
past	1
other	1
trains	1
the	1
wheels	1
moving	1
more	1
smoothly	1
and	1
evenly	1
resounded	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
clang	1
on	1
the	1
rails	1
The	1
window	1
was	1
lighted	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
bright	1
evening	1
sun	1
and	1
a	1
slight	1
breeze	1
fluttered	1
the	1
curtain	1
Anna	1
forgot	1
her	1
fellow	1
passengers	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
swaying	1
of	1
the	1
train	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1
thinking	1
again	1
as	1
she	1
breathed	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
Yes	1
what	1
did	1
I	1
stop	1
at	1
That	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
conceive	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
life	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
misery	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
created	1
to	1
be	1
miserable	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
all	1
invent	1
means	1
of	1
deceiving	1
each	1
other	1
And	1
when	1
one	1
sees	1
the	1
truth	1
what	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
do	1
That	1
s	1
what	1
reason	1
is	1
given	1
man	1
for	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
what	1
worries	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
French	1
lisping	1
affectedly	1
and	1
obviously	1
pleased	1
with	1
her	1
phrase	1
The	1
words	1
seemed	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
Anna	1
s	1
thoughts	1
To	1
escape	1
from	1
what	1
worries	1
him	1
repeated	1
Anna	1
And	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
cheeked	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
thin	1
wife	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
sickly	1
wife	1
considered	1
herself	1
misunderstood	1
and	1
the	1
husband	1
deceived	1
her	1
and	1
encouraged	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
idea	1
of	1
herself	1
Anna	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
their	1
history	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
crannies	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
turning	1
a	1
light	1
upon	1
them	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
interesting	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
she	1
pursued	1
her	1
thought	1
Yes	1
I	1
m	1
very	1
much	1
worried	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
reason	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
for	1
to	1
escape	1
so	1
then	1
one	1
must	1
escape	1
why	1
not	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
when	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
when	1
it	1
s	1
sickening	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
all	1
But	1
how	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
conductor	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
footboard	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
shrieking	1
those	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
that	1
train	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
talking	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
laughing	1
It	1
s	1
all	1
falsehood	1
all	1
lying	1
all	1
humbug	1
all	1
cruelty	1
When	1
the	1
train	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
station	1
Anna	1
got	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
passengers	1
and	1
moving	1
apart	1
from	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
lepers	1
she	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
here	1
for	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
Everything	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
possible	1
before	1
was	1
now	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
consider	1
especially	1
in	1
this	1
noisy	1
crowd	1
of	1
hideous	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
alone	1
One	1
moment	1
porters	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
proffering	1
their	1
services	1
then	1
young	1
men	1
clacking	1
their	1
heels	1
on	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
platform	1
and	1
talking	1
loudly	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
people	1
meeting	1
her	1
dodged	1
past	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
side	1
Remembering	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
further	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
answer	1
she	1
stopped	1
a	1
porter	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
her	1
coachman	1
were	1
not	1
here	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
They	1
sent	1
up	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
Vronskys	1
just	1
this	1
minute	1
to	1
meet	1
Princess	1
Sorokina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
coachman	1
like	1
Just	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
porter	1
the	1
coachman	1
Mihail	1
red	1
and	1
cheerful	1
in	1
his	1
smart	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
chain	1
evidently	1
proud	1
of	1
having	1
so	1
successfully	1
performed	1
his	1
commission	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
She	1
broke	1
it	1
open	1
and	1
her	1
heart	1
ached	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
your	1
note	1
did	1
not	1
reach	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
home	1
at	1
ten	1
Vronsky	1
had	1
written	1
carelessly	1
Yes	1
that	1
s	1
what	1
I	1
expected	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
evil	1
smile	1
Very	1
good	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
home	1
then	1
she	1
said	1
softly	1
addressing	1
Mihail	1
She	1
spoke	1
softly	1
because	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1

hindered	1
her	1
breathing	1
No	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
let	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
miserable	1
she	1
thought	1
menacingly	1
addressing	1
not	1
him	1
not	1
herself	1
but	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
suffer	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
platform	1
Two	1
maid	1
servants	1
walking	1
along	1
the	1
platform	1
turned	1
their	1
heads	1
staring	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
making	1
some	1
remarks	1
about	1
her	1
dress	1
Real	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
lace	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
The	1
young	1
men	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
in	1
peace	1
Again	1
they	1
passed	1
by	1
peering	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
shouting	1
something	1
in	1
an	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
The	1
station	1
master	1
coming	1
up	1
asked	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
by	1
train	1
A	1
boy	1
selling	1
kvas	1
never	1
took	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her	1
My	1
God	1
where	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
go	1
she	1
thought	1
going	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
along	1
the	1
platform	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
she	1
stopped	1
Some	1
ladies	1
and	1
children	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
spectacles	1
paused	1
in	1
their	1
loud	1
laughter	1
and	1
talking	1
and	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
reached	1
them	1
She	1
quickened	1
her	1
pace	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
platform	1
A	1
luggage	1
train	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
The	1
platform	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
again	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
crushed	1
by	1
the	1
train	1
the	1
day	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
met	1
Vronsky	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
With	1
a	1
rapid	1
light	1
step	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
that	1
led	1
from	1
the	1
tank	1
to	1
the	1
rails	1
and	1
stopped	1
quite	1
near	1
the	1
approaching	1
train	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
carriages	1
at	1
the	1
screws	1
and	1
chains	1
and	1
the	1
tall	1
cast	1
iron	1
wheel	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
carriage	1
slowly	1
moving	1
up	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
measure	1
the	1
middle	1
between	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
back	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
minute	1
when	1
that	1
middle	1
point	1
would	1
be	1
opposite	1
her	1
There	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
sand	1
and	1
coal	1
dust	1
which	1
covered	1
the	1
sleepers	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
middle	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
him	1
and	1
escape	1
from	1
everyone	1
and	1
from	1
myself	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
fling	1
herself	1
below	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
carriage	1
as	1
it	1
reached	1
her	1
but	1
the	1
red	1
bag	1
which	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
drop	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
delayed	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
she	1
missed	1
the	1
moment	1
She	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
carriage	1
A	1
feeling	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
when	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
plunge	1
in	1
bathing	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
crossed	1
herself	1
That	1
familiar	1
gesture	1
brought	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
soul	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
girlish	1
and	1
childish	1
memories	1
and	1
suddenly	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
had	1
covered	1
everything	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
torn	1
apart	1
and	1
life	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
her	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
bright	1
past	1
joys	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
carriage	1
And	1
exactly	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
space	1
between	1
the	1
wheels	1
came	1
opposite	1
her	1
she	1
dropped	1
the	1
red	1
bag	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
head	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
shoulders	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
hands	1
under	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
lightly	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
rise	1
again	1
at	1
once	1
dropped	1
on	1
to	1
her	1
knees	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
she	1
was	1
terror	1
stricken	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
Where	1
am	1
I	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
doing	1
What	1
for	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
to	1
drop	1
backwards	1
but	1
something	1
huge	1
and	1
merciless	1
struck	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
rolled	1
her	1
on	1
her	1
back	1
Lord	1
forgive	1
me	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
feeling	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
struggle	1
A	1
peasant	1
muttering	1
something	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
iron	1
above	1
her	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
book	1
filled	1
with	1
troubles	1
falsehoods	1
sorrow	1
and	1
evil	1
flared	1
up	1
more	1
brightly	1
than	1
ever	1
before	1
lighted	1
up	1
for	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
darkness	1
flickered	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
dim	1
and	1
was	1
quenched	1
forever	1
PART	1
EIGHT	1
Chapter	1
1	1
Almost	1
two	1
months	1
had	1
passed	1
The	1
hot	1
summer	1
was	1
half	1
over	1
but	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
only	1
just	1
preparing	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
life	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
uneventful	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
A	1
year	1
ago	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
book	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
six	1
years	1
labor	1
Sketch	1
of	1
a	1
Survey	1
of	1
the	1
Principles	1
and	1
Forms	1
of	1
Government	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
Russia	1
Several	1
sections	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
and	1
its	1
introduction	1
had	1
appeared	1
in	1
periodical	1
publications	1
and	1
other	1
parts	1
had	1
been	1
read	1
by	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
to	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
circle	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
leading	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
completely	1
novel	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
But	1
still	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
expected	1
that	1
on	1
its	1
appearance	1
his	1
book	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
serious	1
impression	1
on	1
society	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
social	1
science	1
it	1
would	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
stir	1
in	1
the	1
scientific	1
world	1
After	1
the	1
most	1
conscientious	1
revision	1
the	1
book	1
had	1
last	1
year	1
been	1
published	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
distributed	1
among	1
the	1
booksellers	1
Though	1
he	1
asked	1
no	1
one	1
about	1
it	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
with	1
feigned	1
indifference	1
answered	1
his	1
friends	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
booksellers	1
how	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
selling	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
alert	1
with	1
strained	1
attention	1
watching	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
impression	1
his	1
book	1
would	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
in	1
literature	1
But	1
a	1
week	1
passed	1
a	1
second	1
a	1
third	1
and	1
in	1
society	1
no	1
impression	1
whatever	1
could	1
be	1
detected	1
His	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
specialists	1
and	1
savants	1
occasionally	1
unmistakably	1
from	1
politeness	1
alluded	1
to	1
it	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintances	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
on	1
a	1
learned	1
subject	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
And	1
society	1
generally	1
just	1
now	1
especially	1
absorbed	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
was	1
absolutely	1
indifferent	1
In	1
the	1
press	1
too	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
calculated	1
to	1
a	1
nicety	1
the	1
time	1
necessary	1
for	1
writing	1
a	1
review	1
but	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
still	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
Northern	1
Beetle	1
in	1
a	1
comic	1
article	1
on	1
the	1
singer	1
Drabanti	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
voice	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
allusion	1
to	1
Koznishev	1
s	1
book	1
suggesting	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
ago	1
seen	1
through	1
by	1
everyone	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
general	1
ridicule	1
At	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
a	1
critical	1
article	1
appeared	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
review	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
knew	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
He	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
once	1
at	1
Golubtsov	1
s	1
The	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
an	1
invalid	1
very	1
bold	1
as	1
a	1
writer	1
but	1
extremely	1
deficient	1
in	1
breeding	1
and	1
shy	1
in	1
personal	1
relations	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
absolute	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
author	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
complete	1
respect	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
set	1
about	1
reading	1
the	1
article	1
The	1
article	1
was	1
awful	1
The	1
critic	1
had	1
undoubtedly	1
put	1
an	1
interpretation	1
upon	1
the	1
book	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
it	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
selected	1
quotations	1
so	1
adroitly	1
that	1
for	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
obviously	1
scarcely	1
anyone	1
had	1
read	1
it	1
it	1
seemed	1
absolutely	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
book	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
medley	1
of	1
high	1
flown	1
phrases	1
not	1
even	1
as	1
suggested	1
by	1
marks	1
of	1
interrogation	1
used	1
appropriately	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
absolutely	1
without	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
wittily	1
done	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
disowned	1
such	1
wit	1
himself	1
But	1
that	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
was	1
so	1
awful	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
scrupulous	1
conscientiousness	1
with	1
which	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
verified	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
the	1
critic	1
s	1
arguments	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
stop	1
to	1
ponder	1
over	1
the	1
faults	1
and	1
mistakes	1
which	1
were	1
ridiculed	1
but	1
unconsciously	1
he	1
began	1
immediately	1
trying	1
to	1
recall	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
and	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
Didn	1
t	1
I	1
offend	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
wondered	1
And	1
remembering	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
met	1
he	1
had	1
corrected	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
about	1
something	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
betrayed	1
ignorance	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
found	1
the	1
clue	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
article	1
This	1
article	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
deadly	1
silence	1
about	1
the	1
book	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
press	1
and	1
in	1
conversation	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
six	1
years	1
task	1
toiled	1
at	1
with	1
such	1
love	1
and	1
labor	1
had	1
gone	1
leaving	1
no	1
trace	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
position	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
difficult	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
book	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
literary	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
hitherto	1
occupied	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
clever	1
cultivated	1
healthy	1
and	1
energetic	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
use	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
his	1
energy	1
Conversations	1
in	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
in	1
meetings	1
assemblies	1
and	1
committees	1
everywhere	1
where	1
talk	1
was	1
possible	1
took	1
up	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
But	1
being	1
used	1
for	1
years	1
to	1
town	1
life	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
waste	1
all	1
his	1
energies	1
in	1
talk	1
as	1
his	1
less	1
experienced	1
younger	1
brother	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Moscow	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
leisure	1
and	1
intellectual	1
energy	1
still	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
Fortunately	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
so	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
his	1
book	1
the	1
various	1
public	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
dissenting	1
sects	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
alliance	1
of	1
the	1
Samara	1
famine	1
of	1
exhibitions	1
and	1
of	1
spiritualism	1
were	1
definitely	1
replaced	1
in	1
public	1
interest	1
by	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
question	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
rather	1
languidly	1
interested	1
society	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
raise	1
this	1
subject	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
it	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
In	1
the	1
circle	1
to	1
which	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
belonged	1
nothing	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
or	1
written	1
about	1
just	1
now	1
but	1
the	1
Servian	1
War	1
Everything	1
that	1
the	1
idle	1
crowd	1
usually	1
does	1
to	1
kill	1
time	1
was	1
done	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
States	1
Balls	1
concerts	1
dinners	1
matchboxes	1
ladies	1
dresses	1
beer	1
restaurants	1
everything	1
testified	1
to	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
peoples	1
From	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
spoken	1
and	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
differed	1
on	1
various	1
points	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
question	1
had	1
become	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
fashionable	1
distractions	1
which	1
succeed	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
providing	1
society	1
with	1
an	1
object	1
and	1
an	1
occupation	1
He	1
saw	1
too	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
people	1
were	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
subject	1
from	1
motives	1
of	1
self	1
interest	1
and	1
self	1
advertisement	1
He	1
recognized	1
that	1
the	1
newspapers	1
published	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
that	1
was	1
superfluous	1
and	1
exaggerated	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
aim	1
of	1
attracting	1
attention	1
and	1
outbidding	1
one	1
another	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
general	1
movement	1
those	1
who	1
thrust	1
themselves	1
most	1
forward	1
and	1
shouted	1
the	1
loudest	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
failed	1
and	1
were	1
smarting	1
under	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
injury	1
generals	1
without	1
armies	1
ministers	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
ministry	1
journalists	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
paper	1
party	1
leaders	1
without	1
followers	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
was	1
frivolous	1
and	1
absurd	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
recognized	1
an	1
unmistakable	1
growing	1
enthusiasm	1
uniting	1
all	1
classes	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
sympathize	1
The	1
massacre	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
fellow	1
Christians	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Slavonic	1
race	1
excited	1
sympathy	1
for	1
the	1
sufferers	1
and	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
oppressors	1
And	1
the	1
heroism	1
of	1
the	1
Servians	1
and	1
Montenegrins	1
struggling	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
cause	1
begot	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
people	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
help	1
their	1
brothers	1
not	1
in	1
word	1
but	1
in	1
deed	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
aspect	1
that	1
rejoiced	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
public	1
opinion	1
The	1
public	1
had	1
definitely	1
expressed	1
its	1
desire	1
The	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
as	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
said	1
found	1
expression	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
worked	1
in	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
more	1
incontestable	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cause	1
destined	1
to	1
assume	1
vast	1
dimensions	1
to	1
create	1
an	1
epoch	1
He	1
threw	1
himself	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
into	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
cause	1
and	1
forgot	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
his	1
book	1
His	1
whole	1
time	1
now	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
scarcely	1
manage	1
to	1
answer	1
all	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
appeals	1
addressed	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
worked	1
the	1
whole	1
spring	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
July	1
that	1
he	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
both	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
farthest	1
wilds	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
uplifting	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
which	1
like	1
all	1
residents	1
in	1
the	1
capital	1
and	1
big	1
towns	1
he	1
was	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
Levin	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
with	1
him	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
reached	1
the	1
station	1
of	1
the	1
Kursk	1
line	1
which	1
was	1
particularly	1
busy	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
people	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
looking	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
groom	1
who	1
was	1
following	1
with	1
their	1
things	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
volunteers	1
driving	1
up	1
in	1
four	1
cabs	1
Ladies	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
bouquets	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
rushing	1
crowd	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
station	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
volunteers	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
addressed	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
You	1
too	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
off	1
she	1
asked	1
in	1
French	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
away	1
myself	1
princess	1
To	1
my	1
brother	1
s	1
for	1
a	1
holiday	1
Do	1
you	1
always	1
see	1
them	1
off	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
a	1
hardly	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
Oh	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
eight	1
hundred	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
from	1
us	1
already	1
Malvinsky	1
wouldn	1
t	1
believe	1
me	1
More	1
than	1
eight	1
hundred	1
If	1
you	1
reckon	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
not	1
directly	1
from	1
Moscow	1
over	1
a	1
thousand	1
answered	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
There	1
That	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
lady	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
true	1
too	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
million	1
has	1
been	1
subscribed	1
Yes	1
princess	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
today	1
s	1
telegram	1
Beaten	1
the	1
Turks	1
again	1
Yes	1
so	1
I	1
saw	1
answered	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
They	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
telegram	1
stating	1
that	1
the	1
Turks	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
succession	1
beaten	1
at	1
all	1
points	1
and	1
put	1
to	1
flight	1
and	1
that	1
tomorrow	1
a	1
decisive	1
engagement	1
was	1
expected	1
Ah	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
splendid	1
young	1
fellow	1
has	1
asked	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
they	1
ve	1
made	1
some	1
difficulty	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
why	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
please	1
write	1
a	1
note	1
about	1
his	1
case	1
He	1
s	1
being	1
sent	1
by	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
asked	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
the	1
princess	1
knew	1
about	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
waiting	1
room	1
wrote	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
the	1
person	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
granting	1
of	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
depended	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
You	1
know	1
Count	1
Vronsky	1
the	1
notorious	1
one	1
is	1
going	1
by	1
this	1
train	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
full	1
of	1
triumph	1
and	1
meaning	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
again	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
letter	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
By	1
this	1
train	1
I	1
ve	1
seen	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
here	1
there	1
s	1
only	1
his	1
mother	1
seeing	1
him	1
off	1
It	1
s	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
anyway	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
Oh	1
yes	1
of	1
course	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
the	1
crowd	1
streamed	1
by	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
They	1
went	1
forward	1
too	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
gentleman	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
delivering	1
a	1
loud	1
discourse	1
to	1
the	1
volunteers	1
In	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
religion	1
humanity	1
and	1
our	1
brothers	1
the	1
gentleman	1
said	1
his	1
voice	1
growing	1
louder	1
and	1
louder	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
cause	1
mother	1
Moscow	1
dedicates	1
you	1
with	1
her	1
blessing	1
Jivio	1
	1
he	1
concluded	1
loudly	1
and	1
tearfully	1
Everyone	1
shouted	1
Jivio	1
	1
and	1
a	1
fresh	1
crowd	1
dashed	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
almost	1
carrying	1
the	1
princess	1
off	1
her	1
legs	1
Ah	1
princess	1
that	1
was	1
something	1
like	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
suddenly	1
appearing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
beaming	1
upon	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
delighted	1
smile	1
Capitally	1
warmly	1
said	1
wasn	1
t	1
it	1
Bravo	1
And	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Why	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
just	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
encourage	1
them	1
you	1
do	1
that	1
so	1
well	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
respectful	1
and	1
discreet	1
smile	1
moving	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
forward	1
a	1
little	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
No	1
I	1
m	1
just	1

Where	1

To	1

	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
apologizing	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
And	1
Princess	1
Myakaya	1
not	1
Liza	1
but	1
Bibish	1
is	1
sending	1
a	1
thousand	1
guns	1
and	1
twelve	1
nurses	1
Did	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Yes	1
I	1
heard	1
so	1
answered	1
Koznishev	1
indifferently	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
away	1
said	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Tomorrow	1
we	1
re	1
giving	1
a	1
dinner	1
to	1
two	1
who	1
re	1
setting	1
off	1
Dimer	1
Bartnyansky	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
our	1
Veslovsky	1
Grisha	1
They	1
re	1
both	1
going	1
Veslovsky	1
s	1
only	1
lately	1
married	1
There	1
s	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
for	1
you	1
Eh	1
princess	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
at	1
Koznishev	1
without	1
replying	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcert	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
Smiling	1
he	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
feather	1
in	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
hat	1
and	1
then	1
about	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
pick	1
something	1
up	1
Seeing	1
a	1
lady	1
approaching	1
with	1
a	1
collecting	1
box	1
he	1
beckoned	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
five	1
rouble	1
note	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
see	1
these	1
collecting	1
boxes	1
unmoved	1
while	1
I	1
ve	1
money	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
he	1
said	1
And	1
how	1
about	1
today	1
s	1
telegram	1
Fine	1
chaps	1
those	1
Montenegrins	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
say	1
so	1
he	1
cried	1
when	1
the	1
princess	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
going	1
by	1
this	1
train	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
s	1
face	1
looked	1
sad	1
but	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
when	1
stroking	1
his	1
mustaches	1
and	1
swinging	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
his	1
own	1
despairing	1
sobs	1
over	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
corpse	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
Vronsky	1
only	1
a	1
hero	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
faults	1
one	1
can	1
t	1
refuse	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
justice	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
What	1
a	1
typically	1
Russian	1
Slav	1
nature	1
Only	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
pleasant	1
for	1
Vronsky	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
Say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
I	1
m	1
touched	1
by	1
that	1
man	1
s	1
fate	1
Do	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
Yes	1
perhaps	1
if	1
it	1
happens	1
so	1
I	1
never	1
liked	1
him	1
But	1
this	1
atones	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
He	1
s	1
not	1
merely	1
going	1
himself	1
he	1
s	1
taking	1
a	1
squadron	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
expense	1
Yes	1
so	1
I	1
heard	1
A	1
bell	1
sounded	1
Everyone	1
crowded	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
indicating	1
Vronsky	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
walked	1
by	1
wearing	1
a	1
long	1
overcoat	1
and	1
wide	1
brimmed	1
black	1
hat	1
Oblonsky	1
was	1
walking	1
beside	1
him	1
talking	1
eagerly	1
of	1
something	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
frowning	1
and	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
was	1
saying	1
Probably	1
on	1
Oblonsky	1
s	1
pointing	1
them	1
out	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
where	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
without	1
speaking	1
lifted	1
his	1
hat	1
His	1
face	1
aged	1
and	1
worn	1
by	1
suffering	1
looked	1
stony	1
Going	1
onto	1
the	1
platform	1
Vronsky	1
left	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
disappeared	1
into	1
a	1
compartment	1
On	1
the	1
platform	1
there	1
rang	1
out	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
Tsar	1
then	1
shouts	1
of	1
hurrah	1
and	1
	1
jivio	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
volunteers	1
a	1
tall	1
very	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
hollow	1
chest	1
was	1
particularly	1
conspicuous	1
bowing	1
and	1
waving	1
his	1
felt	1
hat	1
and	1
a	1
nosegay	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
Then	1
two	1
officers	1
emerged	1
bowing	1
too	1
and	1
a	1
stout	1

Saying	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
was	1
joined	1
by	1
Katavasov	1
together	1
they	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
carriage	1
full	1
to	1
overflowing	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
started	1
At	1
Tsaritsino	1
station	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
chorus	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
singing	1
Hail	1
to	1
Thee	1
Again	1
the	1
volunteers	1
bowed	1
and	1
poked	1
their	1
heads	1
out	1
but	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
them	1
He	1
had	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
volunteers	1
that	1
the	1
type	1
was	1
familiar	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him	1
Katavasov	1
whose	1
scientific	1
work	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
having	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
observing	1
them	1
hitherto	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
questioned	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
and	1
talk	1
to	1
them	1
himself	1
At	1
the	1
next	1
station	1
Katavasov	1
acted	1
on	1
this	1
suggestion	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
stop	1
he	1
moved	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
class	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
volunteers	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
obviously	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
passengers	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
in	1
was	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
them	1
More	1
loudly	1
than	1
all	1
talked	1
the	1
tall	1
hollow	1
chested	1
young	1
man	1
He	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
tipsy	1
and	1
was	1
relating	1
some	1
story	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
at	1
his	1
school	1
Facing	1
him	1
sat	1
a	1
middle	1
aged	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Austrian	1
military	1
jacket	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
uniform	1
He	1
was	1
listening	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
chested	1
youth	1
and	1
occasionally	1
pulling	1
him	1
up	1
The	1
third	1
in	1
an	1
artillery	1
uniform	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
box	1
beside	1
them	1
A	1
fourth	1
was	1
asleep	1
Entering	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
youth	1
Katavasov	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
wealthy	1
Moscow	1
merchant	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
through	1
a	1
large	1
fortune	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
Katavasov	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
unmanly	1
and	1
effeminate	1
and	1
sickly	1
He	1
was	1
obviously	1
convinced	1
especially	1
now	1
after	1
drinking	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
performing	1
a	1
heroic	1
action	1
and	1
he	1
bragged	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
way	1
The	1
second	1
the	1
retired	1
officer	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
too	1
upon	1
Katavasov	1
He	1
was	1
it	1
seemed	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
tried	1
everything	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
a	1
railway	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
land	1
steward	1
and	1
had	1
started	1
factories	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
quite	1
without	1
necessity	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
used	1
learned	1
expressions	1
quite	1
inappropriately	1
The	1
third	1
the	1
artilleryman	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
struck	1
Katavasov	1
very	1
favorably	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
quiet	1
modest	1
fellow	1
unmistakably	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
the	1
heroic	1
self	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
and	1
saying	1
nothing	1
about	1
himself	1
When	1
Katavasov	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Servia	1
he	1
answered	1
modestly	1
Oh	1
well	1
everyone	1
s	1
going	1
The	1
Servians	1
want	1
help	1
too	1
I	1
m	1
sorry	1
for	1
them	1
Yes	1
you	1
artillerymen	1
especially	1
are	1
scarce	1
there	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
Oh	1
I	1
wasn	1
t	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
artillery	1
maybe	1
they	1
ll	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
infantry	1
or	1
the	1
cavalry	1
Into	1
the	1
infantry	1
when	1
they	1
need	1
artillery	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
fancying	1
from	1
the	1
artilleryman	1
s	1
apparent	1
age	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
reached	1
a	1
fairly	1
high	1
grade	1
I	1
wasn	1
t	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
artillery	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
cadet	1
retired	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
failed	1
in	1
his	1
examination	1
All	1
of	1
this	1
together	1
made	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
impression	1
on	1
Katavasov	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
volunteers	1
got	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
station	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
Katavasov	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
compare	1
his	1
unfavorable	1
impression	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
someone	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
wearing	1
a	1
military	1
overcoat	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
to	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
volunteers	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
Katavasov	1
addressed	1
him	1
What	1
different	1
positions	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
all	1
those	1
fellows	1
who	1
are	1
going	1
off	1
there	1
Katavasov	1
said	1
vaguely	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
opinion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
anxious	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
views	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
served	1
on	1
two	1
campaigns	1
He	1
knew	1
what	1
makes	1
a	1
soldier	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
those	1
persons	1
by	1
the	1
swagger	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
journey	1
he	1
considered	1
them	1
poor	1
soldiers	1
Moreover	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
district	1
town	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
tell	1
how	1
one	1
soldier	1
had	1
volunteered	1
from	1
his	1
town	1
a	1
drunkard	1
and	1
a	1
thief	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
employ	1
as	1
a	1
laborer	1
But	1
knowing	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
temper	1
it	1
was	1
dangerous	1
to	1
express	1
an	1
opinion	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
one	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
criticize	1
the	1
volunteers	1
unfavorably	1
he	1
too	1
watched	1
Katavasov	1
without	1
committing	1
himself	1
Well	1
men	1
are	1
wanted	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
laughing	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
And	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
war	1
news	1
and	1
each	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
his	1
perplexity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
engagement	1
expected	1
next	1
day	1
since	1
the	1
Turks	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
latest	1
news	1
at	1
all	1
points	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
parted	1
neither	1
giving	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
opinion	1
Katavasov	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
carriage	1
and	1
with	1
reluctant	1
hypocrisy	1
reported	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
his	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
volunteers	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
appear	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
capital	1
fellows	1
At	1
a	1
big	1
station	1
at	1
a	1
town	1
the	1
volunteers	1
were	1
again	1
greeted	1
with	1
shouts	1
and	1
singing	1
again	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
with	1
collecting	1
boxes	1
appeared	1
and	1
provincial	1
ladies	1
brought	1
bouquets	1
to	1
the	1
volunteers	1
and	1
followed	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
refreshment	1
room	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
much	1
smaller	1
and	1
feebler	1
scale	1
than	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Chapter	1
4	1
While	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
provincial	1
town	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
refreshment	1
room	1
but	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
platform	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
passed	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
compartment	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
curtain	1
was	1
drawn	1
over	1
the	1
window	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
it	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
She	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Koznishev	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
you	1
see	1
taking	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Kursk	1
she	1
said	1
Yes	1
so	1
I	1
heard	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
standing	1
at	1
her	1
window	1
and	1
peeping	1
in	1
What	1
a	1
noble	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
added	1
noticing	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
compartment	1
Yes	1
after	1
his	1
misfortune	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
What	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Ah	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
through	1
But	1
do	1
get	1
in	1
Ah	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
through	1
she	1
repeated	1
when	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
got	1
in	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
You	1
can	1
t	1
conceive	1
it	1
For	1
six	1
weeks	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
touch	1
food	1
except	1
when	1
I	1
implored	1
him	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
minute	1
could	1
we	1
leave	1
him	1
alone	1
We	1
took	1
away	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
used	1
against	1
himself	1
We	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reckoning	1
on	1
anything	1
You	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
himself	1
once	1
already	1
on	1
her	1
account	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
s	1
eyelashes	1
twitched	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
Yes	1
hers	1
was	1
the	1
fitting	1
end	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
Even	1
the	1
death	1
she	1
chose	1
was	1
low	1
and	1
vulgar	1
It	1
s	1
not	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
countess	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
you	1
Ah	1
don	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
was	1
staying	1
on	1
my	1
estate	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
A	1
note	1
was	1
brought	1
him	1
He	1
wrote	1
an	1
answer	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
off	1
We	1
hadn	1
t	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
close	1
by	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
I	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
gone	1
to	1
my	1
room	1
when	1
my	1
Mary	1
told	1
me	1
a	1
lady	1
had	1
thrown	1
herself	1
under	1
the	1
train	1
Something	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
I	1
said	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
But	1
they	1
d	1
told	1
him	1
already	1
His	1
coachman	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
When	1
I	1
ran	1
into	1
his	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
beside	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
fearful	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
He	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
but	1
galloped	1
off	1
there	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
what	1
happened	1
there	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
back	1
at	1
death	1
s	1
door	1
I	1
shouldn	1
t	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
Prostration	1
compl`ete	1
	1
the	1
doctor	1
said	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
followed	1
almost	1
by	1
madness	1
Oh	1
why	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
awful	1
time	1
No	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
bad	1
woman	1
Why	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
such	1
desperate	1
passions	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
to	1
show	1
herself	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
Well	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
do	1
She	1
brought	1
herself	1
to	1
ruin	1
and	1
two	1
good	1
men	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
my	1
unhappy	1
son	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
her	1
husband	1
do	1
asked	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
her	1
daughter	1
Alexey	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
anything	1
at	1
first	1
Now	1
it	1
worries	1
him	1
terribly	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
his	1
own	1
child	1
away	1
to	1
another	1
man	1
But	1
he	1
can	1
t	1
take	1
back	1
his	1
word	1
Karenin	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
funeral	1
But	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
meeting	1
Alexey	1
For	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
was	1
easier	1
anyway	1
She	1
had	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
But	1
my	1
poor	1
son	1
was	1
utterly	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
He	1
had	1
thrown	1
up	1
everything	1
his	1
career	1
me	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
mercy	1
on	1
him	1
but	1
of	1
set	1
purpose	1
she	1
made	1
his	1
ruin	1
complete	1
No	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
her	1
very	1
death	1
was	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
vile	1
woman	1
of	1
no	1
religious	1
feeling	1
God	1
forgive	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
help	1
hating	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
son	1
s	1
misery	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
now	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
blessing	1
from	1
Providence	1
for	1
us	1
this	1
Servian	1
war	1
I	1
m	1
old	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
understand	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
wrongs	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
s	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
providential	1
blessing	1
to	1

Of	1
course	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
it	1

But	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
helped	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
rouse	1
him	1
Yashvin	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
cards	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
Servia	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
and	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
Now	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
interest	1
for	1
him	1
Do	1
please	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
distract	1
his	1
mind	1
He	1
s	1
so	1
low	1
spirited	1
And	1
as	1
bad	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
toothache	1
too	1
But	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
Please	1
do	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
s	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
and	1
crossed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
station	1
Chapter	1
5	1
In	1
the	1
slanting	1
evening	1
shadows	1
cast	1
by	1
the	1
baggage	1
piled	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
platform	1
Vronsky	1
in	1
his	1
long	1
overcoat	1
and	1
slouch	1
hat	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets	1
strode	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
turning	1
sharply	1
after	1
twenty	1
paces	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
fancied	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
him	1
that	1
Vronsky	1
saw	1
him	1
but	1
was	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
This	1
did	1
not	1
affect	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
in	1
the	1
slightest	1
He	1
was	1
above	1
all	1
personal	1
considerations	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
looked	1
upon	1
Vronsky	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
taking	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
cause	1
and	1
Koznishev	1
thought	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
encourage	1
him	1
and	1
express	1
his	1
approval	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
Vronsky	1
stood	1
still	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
him	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
going	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
him	1
very	1
warmly	1
Possibly	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
but	1
couldn	1
t	1
I	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
There	1
s	1
no	1
one	1
I	1
should	1
less	1
dislike	1
seeing	1
than	1
you	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
Excuse	1
me	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
in	1
life	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
like	1
I	1
quite	1
understand	1
and	1
I	1
merely	1
meant	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
services	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
scanning	1
Vronsky	1
s	1
face	1
full	1
of	1
unmistakable	1
suffering	1
Wouldn	1
t	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Ristitch	1
to	1
Milan	1
Oh	1
no	1
Vronsky	1
said	1
seeming	1
to	1
understand	1
him	1
with	1
difficulty	1
If	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
let	1
s	1
walk	1
on	1
It	1
s	1
so	1
stuffy	1
among	1
the	1
carriages	1
A	1
letter	1
No	1
thank	1
you	1
to	1
meet	1
death	1
one	1
needs	1
no	1
letters	1
of	1
introduction	1
Nor	1
for	1
the	1
Turks	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
was	1
merely	1
of	1
the	1
lips	1
His	1
eyes	1
still	1
kept	1
their	1
look	1
of	1
angry	1
suffering	1
Yes	1
but	1
you	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
relations	1
which	1
are	1
after	1
all	1
essential	1
with	1
anyone	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
intention	1
There	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
many	1
attacks	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
volunteers	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
you	1
raises	1
them	1
in	1
public	1
estimation	1
My	1
use	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
said	1
Vronsky	1
is	1
that	1
life	1
s	1
worth	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
ve	1
enough	1
bodily	1
energy	1
to	1
cut	1
my	1
way	1
into	1
their	1
ranks	1
and	1
to	1
trample	1
on	1
them	1
or	1
fall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
there	1
s	1
something	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
for	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
simply	1
useless	1
but	1
loathsome	1
to	1
me	1
Anyone	1
s	1
welcome	1
to	1
it	1
And	1
his	1
jaw	1
twitched	1
impatiently	1
from	1
the	1
incessant	1
gnawing	1
toothache	1
that	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
even	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
natural	1
expression	1
You	1
will	1
become	1
another	1
man	1
I	1
predict	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
feeling	1
touched	1
To	1
deliver	1
one	1
s	1
brother	1
men	1
from	1
bondage	1
is	1
an	1
aim	1
worth	1
death	1
and	1
life	1
God	1
grant	1
you	1
success	1
outwardly	1
and	1
inwardly	1
peace	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
Vronsky	1
warmly	1
pressed	1
his	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
Yes	1
as	1
a	1
weapon	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
I	1
m	1
a	1
wreck	1
he	1
jerked	1
out	1
He	1
could	1
hardly	1
speak	1
for	1
the	1
throbbing	1
ache	1
in	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth	1
that	1
were	1
like	1
rows	1
of	1
ivory	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
tender	1
slowly	1
and	1
smoothly	1
rolling	1
along	1
the	1
rails	1
And	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
different	1
pain	1
not	1
an	1
ache	1
but	1
an	1
inner	1
trouble	1
that	1
set	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
in	1
anguish	1
made	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
forget	1
his	1
toothache	1
As	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
tender	1
and	1
the	1
rails	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
friend	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
met	1
since	1
his	1
misfortune	1
he	1
suddenly	1
recalled	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
like	1
one	1
distraught	1
into	1
the	1
cloak	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
shamelessly	1
sprawling	1
out	1
among	1
strangers	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
body	1
so	1
lately	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
head	1
unhurt	1
dropping	1
back	1
with	1
its	1
weight	1
of	1
hair	1
and	1
the	1
curling	1
tresses	1
about	1
the	1
temples	1
and	1
the	1
exquisite	1
face	1
with	1
red	1
half	1
opened	1
mouth	1
the	1
strange	1
fixed	1
expression	1
piteous	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
and	1
awful	1
in	1
the	1
still	1
open	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
utter	1
that	1
fearful	1
phrase	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
quarreling	1
And	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
her	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
at	1
a	1
railway	1
station	1
too	1
mysterious	1
exquisite	1
loving	1
seeking	1
and	1
giving	1
happiness	1
and	1
not	1
cruelly	1
revengeful	1
as	1
he	1
remembered	1
her	1
on	1
that	1
last	1
moment	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
recall	1
his	1
best	1
moments	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
those	1
moments	1
were	1
poisoned	1
forever	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
triumphant	1
successful	1
in	1
her	1
menace	1
of	1
a	1
wholly	1
useless	1
remorse	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
effaced	1
He	1
lost	1
all	1
consciousness	1
of	1
toothache	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
worked	1
with	1
sobs	1
Passing	1
twice	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
baggage	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
regaining	1
his	1
self	1
possession	1
he	1
addressed	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
calmly	1
You	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
telegrams	1
since	1
yesterday	1
s	1
Yes	1
driven	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
but	1
a	1
decisive	1
engagement	1
expected	1
for	1
tomorrow	1
And	1
after	1
talking	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
King	1
Milan	1
s	1
proclamation	1
and	1
the	1
immense	1
effect	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
they	1
parted	1
going	1
to	1
their	1
carriages	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
second	1
bell	1

Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
had	1
not	1
telegraphed	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
leave	1
Moscow	1
Levin	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home	1
when	1
Katavasov	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
in	1
a	1
fly	1
hired	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
Pokrovskoe	1
house	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
Moors	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
Kitty	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
balcony	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
sister	1
recognized	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
What	1
a	1
shame	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
she	1
said	1
giving	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
forehead	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
kiss	1
We	1
drove	1
here	1
capitally	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
put	1
you	1
out	1
answered	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
m	1
so	1
dirty	1
I	1
m	1
afraid	1
to	1
touch	1
you	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
so	1
busy	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tear	1
myself	1
away	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
re	1
still	1
as	1
ever	1
enjoying	1
your	1
peaceful	1
quiet	1
happiness	1
he	1
said	1
smiling	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
in	1
your	1
peaceful	1
backwater	1
Here	1
s	1
our	1
friend	1
Fyodor	1
Vassilievitch	1
who	1
has	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
here	1
at	1
last	1
But	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
when	1
I	1
wash	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
in	1
his	1
jesting	1
fashion	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
hands	1
and	1
smiled	1
his	1
teeth	1
flashing	1
white	1
in	1
his	1
black	1
face	1
Kostya	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
He	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
his	1
settlement	1
It	1
s	1
time	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
home	1
Busy	1
as	1
ever	1
with	1
his	1
farming	1
It	1
really	1
is	1
a	1
peaceful	1
backwater	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
while	1
we	1
in	1
town	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
Servian	1
war	1
Well	1
how	1
does	1
our	1
friend	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
He	1
s	1
sure	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
like	1
other	1
people	1
Oh	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
like	1
everybody	1
else	1
Kitty	1
answered	1
a	1
little	1
embarrassed	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
ll	1
send	1
to	1
fetch	1
him	1
Papa	1
s	1
staying	1
with	1
us	1
He	1
s	1
only	1
just	1
come	1
home	1
from	1
abroad	1
And	1
making	1
arrangements	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
Levin	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
guests	1
to	1
wash	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
Dolly	1
s	1
and	1
giving	1
orders	1
for	1
their	1
luncheon	1
Kitty	1
ran	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
balcony	1
enjoying	1
the	1
freedom	1
and	1
rapidity	1
of	1
movement	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
deprived	1
during	1
the	1
months	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
It	1
s	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
a	1
professor	1
she	1
said	1
Oh	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
bore	1
in	1
this	1
heat	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
No	1
papa	1
he	1
s	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
Kostya	1
s	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
him	1
Kitty	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
deprecating	1
smile	1
noticing	1
the	1
irony	1
on	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
face	1
Oh	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
say	1
anything	1
You	1
go	1
to	1
them	1
darling	1
said	1
Kitty	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
entertain	1
them	1
They	1
saw	1
Stiva	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
run	1
to	1
Mitya	1
As	1
ill	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
I	1
haven	1
t	1
fed	1
him	1
since	1
tea	1
He	1
s	1
awake	1
now	1
and	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
screaming	1
And	1
feeling	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
milk	1
she	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
guess	1
her	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
still	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
gauge	1
by	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
her	1
milk	1
his	1
need	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
knew	1
for	1
certain	1
he	1
was	1
hungry	1
She	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
crying	1
before	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
nursery	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
indeed	1
crying	1
She	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
hastened	1
But	1
the	1
faster	1
she	1
went	1
the	1
louder	1
he	1
screamed	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
healthy	1
scream	1
hungry	1
and	1
impatient	1
Has	1
he	1
been	1
screaming	1
long	1
nurse	1
very	1
long	1
said	1
Kitty	1
hurriedly	1
seating	1
herself	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
baby	1
the	1
breast	1
But	1
give	1
me	1
him	1
quickly	1
Oh	1
nurse	1
how	1
tiresome	1
you	1
are	1
There	1
tie	1
the	1
cap	1
afterwards	1

you	1

said	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
who	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
straight	1
A	1

she	1
chanted	1
over	1
him	1
paying	1
no	1

the	1

The	1
nurse	1
brought	1
the	1
baby	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
dissolving	1
with	1
tenderness	1
He	1

Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
cried	1
above	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
screams	1
But	1
Kitty	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
words	1
Her	1
impatience	1
kept	1
growing	1
like	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
Their	1
impatience	1
hindered	1
things	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
The	1
baby	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
breast	1
right	1
and	1
was	1
furious	1
At	1
last	1
after	1
despairing	1
breathless	1
screaming	1
and	1
vain	1
sucking	1
things	1
went	1
right	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
child	1
felt	1
simultaneously	1
soothed	1
and	1
both	1
subsided	1
into	1
calm	1
But	1
poor	1
darling	1
he	1
s	1
all	1
in	1
perspiration	1
said	1
Kitty	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
touching	1
the	1
baby	1
What	1
makes	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
knows	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sidelong	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
eyes	1
that	1
peered	1
roguishly	1
as	1
she	1
fancied	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cap	1
at	1
his	1
rhythmically	1
puffing	1
cheeks	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
red	1
palmed	1
hand	1
he	1
was	1
waving	1
Impossible	1
If	1
he	1
knew	1
anyone	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
me	1
said	1
Kitty	1
in	1
response	1
to	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
statement	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
She	1
smiled	1
because	1
though	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
merely	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
understood	1
everything	1
and	1
knew	1
and	1
understood	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
knew	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
his	1
mother	1
had	1
learned	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
understand	1
only	1
through	1
him	1
To	1

Mihalovna	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
to	1
his	1
grandfather	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
even	1
Mitya	1
was	1
a	1
living	1
being	1
requiring	1
only	1
material	1
care	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
mortal	1
being	1
with	1
whom	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1

relations	1
already	1
When	1
he	1
wakes	1
up	1
please	1
God	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
for	1
yourself	1
Then	1
when	1
I	1
do	1
like	1
this	1
he	1
simply	1
beams	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
darling	1
Simply	1
beams	1
like	1
a	1

Well	1
well	1

Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
the	1
nurse	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
blind	1
chased	1
a	1
fly	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
muslin	1
canopy	1
of	1
the	1
crib	1
and	1
a	1
bumblebee	1
struggling	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
frame	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
waving	1
a	1
faded	1
branch	1
of	1
birch	1
over	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
baby	1
How	1
hot	1
it	1
is	1
if	1
God	1
would	1
send	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
rain	1
she	1
said	1
Yes	1
yes	1
sh	1
sh	1
sh	1
was	1
all	1
Kitty	1
answered	1
rocking	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
tenderly	1
squeezing	1
the	1
plump	1
little	1
arm	1
with	1
rolls	1
of	1
fat	1
at	1
the	1
wrist	1
which	1
Mitya	1
still	1
waved	1
feebly	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
That	1
hand	1
worried	1
Kitty	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
but	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
waking	1
the	1
baby	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
hand	1
ceased	1
waving	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
closed	1
Only	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
sucking	1
the	1
baby	1
raised	1
his	1
long	1
curly	1
eyelashes	1
and	1
peeped	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
wet	1
eyes	1
that	1
looked	1
black	1
in	1
the	1
twilight	1
The	1
nurse	1
had	1
left	1
off	1
fanning	1
and	1
was	1
dozing	1
From	1
above	1
came	1
the	1
peals	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
chuckle	1
of	1
Katavasov	1
They	1
have	1
got	1
into	1
talk	1
without	1
me	1
thought	1
Kitty	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
s	1
vexing	1
that	1
Kostya	1
s	1
out	1
He	1
s	1
sure	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
again	1
Though	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
pity	1
he	1
s	1
there	1
so	1
often	1
still	1
I	1
m	1
glad	1
It	1
distracts	1
his	1
mind	1
He	1
s	1
become	1
altogether	1
happier	1
and	1
better	1
now	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
gloomy	1
and	1
worried	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
frightened	1
for	1
him	1
And	1
how	1
absurd	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
whispered	1
smiling	1
She	1
knew	1
what	1
worried	1
her	1
husband	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
unbelief	1
Although	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
whether	1
she	1
supposed	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
life	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
damned	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
damned	1
his	1
unbelief	1
did	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
unhappiness	1
And	1
she	1
confessing	1
that	1
for	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
salvation	1
and	1
loving	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
soul	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
his	1
unbelief	1
and	1
told	1
herself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
absurd	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
keep	1
reading	1
philosophy	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
year	1
she	1
wondered	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
written	1
in	1
those	1
books	1
he	1
can	1
understand	1
them	1
If	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
wrong	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
read	1
them	1
He	1
says	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
believe	1
Then	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
doesn	1
t	1
believe	1
Surely	1
from	1
his	1
thinking	1
so	1
much	1
And	1
he	1
thinks	1
so	1
much	1
from	1
being	1
solitary	1
He	1
s	1
always	1
alone	1
alone	1
He	1
can	1
t	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
us	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
ll	1
be	1
glad	1
of	1
these	1
visitors	1
especially	1
Katavasov	1
He	1
likes	1
discussions	1
with	1
them	1
she	1
thought	1
and	1
passed	1
instantly	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
convenient	1
to	1
put	1
Katavasov	1
to	1
sleep	1
alone	1
or	1
to	1
share	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
room	1
And	1
then	1
an	1
idea	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
shudder	1
and	1
even	1
disturb	1
Mitya	1
who	1
glanced	1
severely	1
at	1
her	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
the	1
laundress	1
hasn	1
t	1
sent	1
the	1
washing	1
yet	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
sheets	1
are	1
in	1
use	1
If	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
will	1
give	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
the	1
wrong	1
sheets	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
Kitty	1
s	1
face	1
Yes	1
I	1
will	1
arrange	1
it	1
she	1
decided	1
and	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
thoughts	1
she	1
remembered	1
that	1
some	1
spiritual	1
question	1
of	1
importance	1
had	1
been	1
interrupted	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
recall	1
what	1
Yes	1
Kostya	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
she	1
thought	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Well	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
then	1
Better	1
let	1
him	1
always	1
be	1
one	1
than	1
like	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
abroad	1
No	1
he	1
won	1
t	1
ever	1
sham	1
anything	1
And	1
a	1
recent	1
instance	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
rose	1
vividly	1
to	1
her	1
mind	1
A	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
a	1
penitent	1
letter	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
to	1
Dolly	1
He	1
besought	1
her	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
honor	1
to	1
sell	1
her	1
estate	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
debts	1
Dolly	1
was	1
in	1
despair	1
she	1
detested	1
her	1
husband	1
despised	1
him	1
pitied	1
him	1
resolved	1
on	1
a	1
separation	1
resolved	1
to	1
refuse	1
but	1
ended	1
by	1
agreeing	1
to	1
sell	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
property	1
After	1
that	1
with	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
smile	1
of	1
tenderness	1
Kitty	1
recalled	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
shamefaced	1
embarrassment	1
his	1
repeated	1
awkward	1
efforts	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
how	1
at	1
last	1
having	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
means	1
of	1
helping	1
Dolly	1
without	1
wounding	1
her	1
pride	1
he	1
had	1
suggested	1
to	1
Kitty	1
what	1
had	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
give	1
up	1
her	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
He	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
indeed	1
With	1
his	1
heart	1
his	1
dread	1
of	1
offending	1
anyone	1
even	1
a	1
child	1
Everything	1
for	1
others	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
simply	1
considers	1
it	1
as	1
Kostya	1
s	1
duty	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
steward	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
Now	1
Dolly	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
are	1
under	1
his	1
guardianship	1
all	1
these	1
peasants	1
who	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
every	1
day	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
their	1
service	1
Yes	1
only	1
be	1
like	1
your	1
father	1
only	1
like	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
handing	1
Mitya	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
and	1
putting	1
her	1
lips	1
to	1
his	1
cheek	1
Chapter	1
8	1
Ever	1
since	1
by	1
his	1
beloved	1
brother	1
s	1
deathbed	1
Levin	1
had	1
first	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
questions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
these	1
new	1
convictions	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
during	1
the	1
period	1
from	1
his	1
twentieth	1
to	1
his	1
thirty	1
fourth	1
year	1
imperceptibly	1
replaced	1
his	1
childish	1
and	1
youthful	1
beliefs	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
stricken	1
with	1
horror	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
any	1
knowledge	1
of	1
whence	1
and	1
why	1
and	1
how	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
The	1
physical	1
organization	1
its	1
decay	1
the	1
indestructibility	1
of	1
matter	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
conservation	1
of	1
energy	1
evolution	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
usurped	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
belief	1
These	1
words	1
and	1
the	1
ideas	1
associated	1
with	1
them	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
intellectual	1
purposes	1
But	1
for	1
life	1
they	1
yielded	1
nothing	1
and	1
Levin	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
changed	1
his	1
warm	1
fur	1
cloak	1
for	1
a	1
muslin	1
garment	1
and	1
going	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
into	1
the	1
frost	1
is	1
immediately	1
convinced	1
not	1
by	1
reason	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
whole	1
nature	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
naked	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
infallibly	1
perish	1
miserably	1
From	1
that	1
moment	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
distinctly	1
face	1
it	1
and	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
living	1
as	1
before	1
Levin	1
had	1
never	1
lost	1
this	1
sense	1
of	1
terror	1
at	1
his	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge	1
He	1
vaguely	1
felt	1
too	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
new	1
convictions	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
order	1
of	1
ideas	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
was	1
possible	1
At	1
first	1
marriage	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
joys	1
and	1
duties	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
it	1
had	1
completely	1
crowded	1
out	1
these	1
thoughts	1
But	1
of	1
late	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
Moscow	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
confinement	1
with	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
clamored	1
for	1
solution	1
had	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
often	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
insistently	1
haunted	1
Levin	1
s	1
mind	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
summed	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
thus	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
accept	1
the	1
answers	1
Christianity	1
gives	1
to	1
the	1
problems	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
what	1
answers	1
do	1
I	1
accept	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
arsenal	1
of	1
his	1
convictions	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
finding	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
answers	1
he	1
was	1
utterly	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
an	1
answer	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
seeking	1
food	1
in	1
toy	1
shops	1
and	1
tool	1
shops	1
Instinctively	1
unconsciously	1
with	1
every	1
book	1
with	1
every	1
conversation	1
with	1
every	1
man	1
he	1
met	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
light	1
on	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
their	1
solution	1
What	1
puzzled	1
and	1
distracted	1
him	1
above	1
everything	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
age	1
and	1
circle	1
had	1
like	1
him	1
exchanged	1
their	1
old	1
beliefs	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
new	1
convictions	1
and	1
yet	1
saw	1
nothing	1
to	1
lament	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
were	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
and	1
serene	1
So	1
that	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
principal	1
question	1
Levin	1
was	1
tortured	1
by	1
other	1
questions	1
too	1
Were	1
these	1
people	1
sincere	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
or	1
were	1
they	1
playing	1
a	1
part	1
or	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
they	1
understood	1
the	1
answers	1
science	1
gave	1
to	1
these	1
problems	1
in	1
some	1
different	1
clearer	1
sense	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
And	1
he	1
assiduously	1
studied	1
both	1
these	1
men	1
s	1
opinions	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
which	1
treated	1
of	1
these	1
scientific	1
explanations	1
One	1
fact	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
since	1
these	1
questions	1
had	1
engrossed	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
wrong	1
in	1
supposing	1
from	1
the	1
recollections	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
days	1
at	1
college	1
that	1
religion	1
had	1
outlived	1
its	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
practically	1
non	1
existent	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
were	1
good	1
in	1
their	1
lives	1
were	1
believers	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
Lvov	1
whom	1
he	1
liked	1
so	1
much	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
believed	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
believed	1
as	1
simply	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
earliest	1
childhood	1
and	1
ninety	1
nine	1
hundredths	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
working	1
people	1
for	1
whose	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
deepest	1
respect	1
believed	1
Another	1
fact	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
became	1
convinced	1
after	1
reading	1
many	1
scientific	1
books	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
shared	1
his	1
views	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
construction	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
gave	1
no	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
answering	1
but	1
simply	1
ignored	1
their	1
existence	1
and	1
attempted	1
to	1
explain	1
other	1
questions	1
of	1
no	1
possible	1
interest	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
organisms	1
the	1
materialistic	1
theory	1
of	1
consciousness	1
and	1
so	1
forth	1
Moreover	1
during	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
confinement	1
something	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
seemed	1
extraordinary	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
an	1
unbeliever	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
praying	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
prayed	1
he	1
believed	1
But	1
that	1
moment	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
his	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
fit	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
wrong	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
thinking	1
calmly	1
about	1
it	1
it	1
all	1
fell	1
to	1
pieces	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken	1
then	1
for	1
his	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
then	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
weakness	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
desecrate	1
those	1
moments	1
He	1
was	1
miserably	1
divided	1
against	1
himself	1
and	1
strained	1
all	1
his	1
spiritual	1
forces	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
condition	1
Chapter	1
9	1
These	1
doubts	1
fretted	1
and	1
harassed	1
him	1
growing	1
weaker	1
or	1
stronger	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
but	1
never	1
leaving	1
him	1
He	1
read	1
and	1
thought	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
read	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
further	1
he	1
felt	1
from	1
the	1
aim	1
he	1
was	1
pursuing	1
Of	1
late	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
no	1
solution	1
in	1
the	1
materialists	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
and	1
re	1
read	1
thoroughly	1
Plato	1
Spinoza	1
Kant	1
Schelling	1
Hegel	1
and	1
Schopenhauer	1
the	1
philosophers	1
who	1
gave	1
a	1
non	1
materialistic	1
explanation	1
of	1
life	1
Their	1
ideas	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
fruitful	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reading	1
or	1
was	1
himself	1
seeking	1
arguments	1
to	1
refute	1
other	1
theories	1
especially	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
materialists	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
or	1
sought	1
for	1
himself	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
problems	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
always	1
happened	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
followed	1
the	1
fixed	1
definition	1
of	1
obscure	1
words	1
such	1
as	1
spirit	1
will	1
freedom	1
essence	1
	1
purposely	1
letting	1
himself	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
words	1
the	1
philosophers	1
set	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
comprehend	1
something	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
artificial	1
train	1
of	1
reasoning	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
life	1
itself	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
satisfied	1
him	1
while	1
thinking	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
fixed	1
definitions	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
artificial	1
edifice	1
fell	1
to	1
pieces	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
cards	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
edifice	1
had	1
been	1
built	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
transposed	1
words	1
apart	1
from	1
anything	1
in	1
life	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
reason	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
reading	1
Schopenhauer	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
the	1
word	1
love	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
this	1
new	1
philosophy	1
charmed	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
removed	1
a	1
little	1
away	1
from	1
it	1
But	1
then	1
when	1
he	1
turned	1
from	1
life	1
itself	1
to	1
glance	1
at	1
it	1
again	1
it	1
fell	1
away	1
too	1
and	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
muslin	1
garment	1
with	1
no	1
warmth	1
in	1
it	1
His	1
brother	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
advised	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
theological	1
works	1
of	1
Homiakov	1
Levin	1
read	1
the	1
second	1
volume	1
of	1
Homiakov	1
s	1
works	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
elegant	1
epigrammatic	1
argumentative	1
style	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
repelled	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
them	1
He	1
was	1
struck	1
at	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
divine	1
truths	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
vouchsafed	1
to	1
man	1
but	1
to	1
a	1
corporation	1
of	1
men	1
bound	1
together	1
by	1
love	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
What	1
delighted	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
how	1
much	1
easier	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
existing	1
living	1
church	1
embracing	1
all	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
having	1
God	1
at	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
therefore	1
holy	1
and	1
infallible	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
creation	1
the	1
fall	1
the	1
redemption	1
than	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
God	1
a	1
mysterious	1
far	1
away	1
God	1
the	1
creation	1
etc	1
But	1
afterwards	1
on	1
reading	1
a	1
Catholic	1
writer	1
s	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
Greek	1
orthodox	1
writer	1
s	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
churches	1
in	1
their	1
very	1
conception	1
infallible	1
each	1
deny	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Homiakov	1
s	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
lost	1
all	1
its	1
charm	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
this	1
edifice	1
crumbled	1
into	1
dust	1
like	1
the	1
philosophers	1
edifices	1
All	1
that	1
spring	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
himself	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
fearful	1
moments	1
of	1
horror	1
Without	1
knowing	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
here	1
life	1
s	1
impossible	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
know	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
live	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
In	1
infinite	1
time	1
in	1
infinite	1
matter	1
in	1
infinite	1
space	1
is	1
formed	1
a	1
bubble	1
organism	1
and	1
that	1
bubble	1
lasts	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
bursts	1
and	1
that	1
bubble	1
is	1
Me	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
agonizing	1
error	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sole	1
logical	1
result	1
of	1
ages	1
of	1
human	1
thought	1
in	1
that	1
direction	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
ultimate	1
belief	1
on	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
systems	1
elaborated	1
by	1
human	1
thought	1
in	1
almost	1
all	1
their	1
ramifications	1
rested	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
prevalent	1
conviction	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
explanations	1
Levin	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
not	1
knowing	1
when	1
or	1
how	1
chosen	1
it	1
as	1
anyway	1
the	1
clearest	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
own	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
falsehood	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cruel	1
jeer	1
of	1
some	1
wicked	1
power	1
some	1
evil	1
hateful	1
power	1
to	1
whom	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
submit	1
He	1
must	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
power	1
And	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
He	1
had	1
but	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
this	1
dependence	1
on	1
evil	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
means	1
death	1
And	1
Levin	1
a	1
happy	1
father	1
and	1
husband	1
in	1
perfect	1
health	1
was	1
several	1
times	1
so	1
near	1
suicide	1
that	1
he	1
hid	1
the	1
cord	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
hang	1
himself	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
gun	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
shooting	1
himself	1
But	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
shoot	1
himself	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hang	1
himself	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
living	1
Chapter	1
10	1
When	1
Levin	1
thought	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
questions	1
and	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
despair	1
but	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
questioning	1
himself	1
about	1
it	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
both	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
for	1
he	1
acted	1
and	1
lived	1
resolutely	1
and	1
without	1
hesitation	1
Indeed	1
in	1
these	1
latter	1
days	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
decided	1
and	1
unhesitating	1
in	1
life	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
June	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
also	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
pursuits	1
The	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
the	1
neighbors	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
household	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
and	1
brother	1
s	1
property	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
direction	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
kindred	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
bee	1
keeping	1
hobby	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
that	1
spring	1
filled	1
all	1
his	1
time	1
These	1
things	1
occupied	1
him	1
now	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
justified	1
them	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
general	1
principles	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
former	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
disappointed	1
by	1
the	1
failure	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
efforts	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
welfare	1
and	1
too	1
much	1
occupied	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
thought	1
and	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
business	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
burdened	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
he	1
had	1
completely	1
given	1
up	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
and	1
he	1
busied	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
work	1
simply	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
otherwise	1
In	1
former	1
days	1
almost	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
increasingly	1
up	1
to	1
full	1
manhood	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
all	1
for	1
humanity	1
for	1
Russia	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
village	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pleasant	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
itself	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
incoherent	1
that	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
full	1
conviction	1
of	1
its	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
had	1
begun	1
by	1
seeming	1
so	1
great	1
had	1
grown	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
till	1
it	1
vanished	1
into	1
nothing	1
But	1
now	1
since	1
his	1
marriage	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
confine	1
himself	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
living	1
for	1
himself	1
though	1
he	1
experienced	1
no	1
delight	1
at	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
complete	1
conviction	1
of	1
its	1
necessity	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
succeeded	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
old	1
days	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
kept	1
on	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
Now	1
involuntarily	1
it	1
seemed	1
he	1
cut	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
soil	1
like	1
a	1
plough	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
drawn	1
out	1
without	1
turning	1
aside	1
the	1
furrow	1
To	1
live	1
the	1
same	1
family	1
life	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
forefathers	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
condition	1
of	1
culture	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
incontestably	1
necessary	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
necessary	1
as	1
dining	1
when	1
one	1
was	1
hungry	1
And	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
cook	1
dinner	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
agriculture	1
at	1
Pokrovskoe	1
going	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
yield	1
an	1
income	1
Just	1
as	1
incontestably	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
repay	1
a	1
debt	1
was	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
property	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
condition	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
when	1
he	1
received	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
heritage	1
would	1
say	1
thank	1
you	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
as	1
Levin	1
had	1
said	1
thank	1
you	1
to	1
his	1
grandfather	1
for	1
all	1
he	1
built	1
and	1
planted	1
And	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
land	1
himself	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
breed	1
cattle	1
manure	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
plant	1
timber	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
advice	1
and	1
were	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
as	1
impossible	1
as	1
to	1
fling	1
down	1
a	1
child	1
one	1
is	1
carrying	1
in	1
one	1
s	1
arms	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
baby	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
spend	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
each	1
day	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
together	1
with	1
shooting	1
and	1
his	1
new	1
bee	1
keeping	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
no	1
meaning	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
But	1
besides	1
knowing	1
thoroughly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
Levin	1
knew	1
in	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
must	1
hire	1
laborers	1
as	1
cheaply	1
as	1
possible	1
but	1
to	1
hire	1
men	1
under	1
bond	1
paying	1
them	1
in	1
advance	1
at	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
current	1
rate	1
of	1
wages	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
do	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
profitable	1
Selling	1
straw	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
scarcity	1
of	1
provender	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
tavern	1
and	1
the	1
pothouse	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
down	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
income	1
Felling	1
timber	1
must	1
be	1
punished	1
as	1
severely	1
as	1
possible	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
exact	1
forfeits	1
for	1
cattle	1
being	1
driven	1
onto	1
his	1
fields	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
annoyed	1
the	1
keeper	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
peasants	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
graze	1
their	1
cattle	1
on	1
his	1
land	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
their	1
cattle	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
To	1
Pyotr	1
who	1
was	1
paying	1
a	1
money	1
lender	1
ten	1
per	1
cent	1
a	1
month	1
he	1
must	1
lend	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
free	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
let	1
off	1
peasants	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
their	1
rent	1
nor	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
into	1
arrears	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
overlook	1
the	1
bailiff	1
s	1
not	1
having	1
mown	1
the	1
meadows	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
hay	1
spoil	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
equally	1
impossible	1
to	1
mow	1
those	1
acres	1
where	1
a	1
young	1
copse	1
had	1
been	1
planted	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
excuse	1
a	1
laborer	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
busy	1
season	1
because	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
dying	1
however	1
sorry	1
he	1
might	1
feel	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
subtract	1
from	1
his	1
pay	1
those	1
costly	1
months	1
of	1
idleness	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
monthly	1
rations	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
servants	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
for	1
anything	1
Levin	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
must	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
unwell	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
three	1
hours	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
could	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
He	1
knew	1
too	1
that	1
regardless	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
taking	1
a	1
swarm	1
he	1
must	1
forego	1
that	1
pleasure	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
see	1
to	1
the	1
bees	1
alone	1
while	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
after	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
Whether	1
he	1
were	1
acting	1
rightly	1
or	1
wrongly	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nowadays	1
he	1
avoided	1
all	1
thought	1
or	1
talk	1
about	1
it	1
Reasoning	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
doubt	1
and	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
seeing	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
When	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
but	1
simply	1
lived	1
he	1
was	1
continually	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
an	1
infallible	1
judge	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
determining	1
which	1
of	1
two	1
possible	1
courses	1
of	1
action	1
was	1
the	1
better	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
worse	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
act	1
rightly	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
So	1
he	1
lived	1
not	1
knowing	1
and	1
not	1
seeing	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
for	1
and	1
harassed	1
at	1
this	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
suicide	1
and	1
yet	1
firmly	1
laying	1
down	1
his	1
own	1
individual	1
definite	1
path	1
in	1
life	1
Chapter	1
11	1
The	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
came	1
to	1
Pokrovskoe	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
Levin	1
s	1
most	1
painful	1
days	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
busiest	1
working	1
time	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
peasantry	1
show	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
intensity	1
of	1
self	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
labor	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
never	1
shown	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
if	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
showed	1
these	1
qualities	1
themselves	1
thought	1
highly	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
repeated	1
every	1
year	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
this	1
intense	1
labor	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
simple	1
To	1
reap	1
and	1
bind	1
the	1
rye	1
and	1
oats	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
mow	1
the	1
meadows	1
turn	1
over	1
the	1
fallows	1
thrash	1
the	1
seed	1
and	1
sow	1
the	1
winter	1
corn	1
all	1
this	1
seems	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
ordinary	1
but	1
to	1
succeed	1
in	1
getting	1
through	1
it	1
all	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
must	1
toil	1
incessantly	1
for	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
weeks	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
usual	1
living	1
on	1
rye	1
beer	1
onions	1
and	1
black	1
bread	1
thrashing	1
and	1
carrying	1
the	1
sheaves	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
not	1
giving	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
four	1
to	1
sleep	1
And	1
every	1
year	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
all	1
over	1
Russia	1
Having	1
lived	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
peasants	1
Levin	1
always	1
felt	1
in	1
this	1
busy	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
infected	1
by	1
this	1
general	1
quickening	1
of	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
morning	1
he	1
rode	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
sowing	1
of	1
the	1
rye	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
oats	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
stacks	1
and	1
returning	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
were	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
drank	1
coffee	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
farm	1
where	1
a	1
new	1
thrashing	1
machine	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
working	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
the	1
seed	1
corn	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
granary	1
still	1
fragrant	1
with	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
hazel	1
branches	1
interlaced	1
on	1
the	1
freshly	1
peeled	1
aspen	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
thatch	1
roof	1
He	1
gazed	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
dry	1
bitter	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
thrashing	1
whirled	1
and	1
played	1
at	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
thrashing	1
floor	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
and	1
the	1
fresh	1
straw	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
barn	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
speckly	1
headed	1
white	1
breasted	1
swallows	1
that	1
flew	1
chirping	1
in	1
under	1
the	1
roof	1
and	1
fluttering	1
their	1
wings	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
crevices	1
of	1
the	1
doorway	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
peasants	1
bustling	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
dusty	1
barn	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
strange	1
thoughts	1
Why	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
being	1
done	1
he	1
thought	1
Why	1
am	1
I	1
standing	1
here	1
making	1
them	1
work	1
What	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
so	1
busy	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
show	1
their	1
zeal	1
before	1
me	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
old	1
Matrona	1
my	1
old	1
friend	1
toiling	1
for	1
I	1
doctored	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
beam	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
thought	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
thin	1
old	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
raking	1
up	1
the	1
grain	1
moving	1
painfully	1
with	1
her	1
bare	1
sun	1
blackened	1
feet	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
rough	1
floor	1
Then	1
she	1
recovered	1
but	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
in	1
ten	1
years	1
she	1
won	1
t	1
they	1
ll	1
bury	1
her	1
and	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
or	1
of	1
that	1
smart	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
red	1
jacket	1
who	1
with	1
that	1
skillful	1
soft	1
action	1
shakes	1
the	1
ears	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
husks	1
They	1
ll	1
bury	1
her	1
and	1
this	1
piebald	1
horse	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
too	1
he	1
thought	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
heavily	1
moving	1
panting	1
horse	1
that	1
kept	1
walking	1
up	1
the	1
wheel	1
that	1
turned	1
under	1
him	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
bury	1
her	1
and	1
Fyodor	1
the	1
thrasher	1
with	1
his	1
curly	1
beard	1
full	1
of	1
chaff	1
and	1
his	1
shirt	1
torn	1
on	1
his	1
white	1
shoulders	1
they	1
will	1
bury	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
untying	1
the	1
sheaves	1
and	1
giving	1
orders	1
and	1
shouting	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
quickly	1
setting	1
straight	1
the	1
strap	1
on	1
the	1
moving	1
wheel	1
And	1
what	1
s	1
more	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
them	1
alone	1
me	1
they	1
ll	1
bury	1
too	1
and	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
What	1
for	1
He	1
thought	1
this	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
to	1
reckon	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
thrashed	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
task	1
to	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
It	1
ll	1
soon	1
be	1
one	1
and	1
they	1
re	1
only	1
beginning	1
the	1
third	1
sheaf	1
thought	1
Levin	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
feeding	1
the	1
machine	1
and	1
shouting	1
over	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
more	1
slowly	1
You	1
put	1
in	1
too	1
much	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
Fyodor	1
Do	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
gets	1
choked	1
that	1
s	1
why	1
it	1
isn	1
t	1
getting	1
on	1
Do	1
it	1
evenly	1
Fyodor	1
black	1
with	1
the	1
dust	1
that	1
clung	1
to	1
his	1
moist	1
face	1
shouted	1
something	1
in	1
response	1
but	1
still	1
went	1
on	1
doing	1
it	1
as	1
Levin	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
Levin	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

Fyodor	1
aside	1
and	1
began	1
feeding	1
the	1
corn	1
in	1
himself	1
Working	1
on	1
till	1
the	1
peasants	1
dinner	1
hour	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
coming	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
barn	1
with	1
Fyodor	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
talk	1
with	1
him	1
stopping	1
beside	1
a	1
neat	1
yellow	1
sheaf	1
of	1
rye	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
thrashing	1
floor	1
for	1

Fyodor	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
village	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
in	1
which	1
Levin	1
had	1
once	1
allotted	1
land	1
to	1
his	1
cooperative	1
association	1
Now	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
let	1
to	1
a	1
former	1
house	1
porter	1
Levin	1
talked	1
to	1
Fyodor	1
about	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
Platon	1
a	1
well	1
to	1
do	1
peasant	1
of	1
good	1
character	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
village	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
year	1
It	1
s	1
a	1
high	1
rent	1
it	1
wouldn	1
t	1
pay	1
Platon	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
answered	1
the	1
peasant	1
picking	1
the	1
ears	1
off	1
his	1
sweat	1
drenched	1
shirt	1
But	1
how	1
does	1
Kirillov	1
make	1
it	1
pay	1
Mituh	1
so	1
the	1
peasant	1
called	1
the	1
house	1
porter	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
contempt	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
ll	1
make	1
it	1
pay	1
Konstantin	1
Dmitrievitch	1
He	1
ll	1
get	1
his	1
share	1
however	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
squeeze	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
He	1
s	1
no	1
mercy	1
on	1
a	1
Christian	1
But	1
Uncle	1
Fokanitch	1
so	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
old	1
peasant	1
Platon	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
he	1
d	1
flay	1
the	1
skin	1
off	1
a	1
man	1
Where	1
there	1
s	1
debt	1
he	1
ll	1
let	1
anyone	1
off	1
And	1
he	1
ll	1
not	1
wring	1
the	1
last	1
penny	1
out	1
He	1
s	1
a	1
man	1
too	1
But	1
why	1
will	1
he	1
let	1
anyone	1
off	1
Oh	1
well	1
of	1
course	1
folks	1
are	1
different	1
One	1
man	1
lives	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
wants	1
and	1
nothing	1
else	1
like	1
Mituh	1
he	1
only	1
thinks	1
of	1
filling	1
his	1
belly	1
but	1
Fokanitch	1
is	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
He	1
lives	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
forget	1
God	1
How	1
thinks	1
of	1
God	1
How	1
does	1
he	1
live	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
Levin	1
almost	1
shouted	1
Why	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
in	1
truth	1
in	1
God	1
s	1
way	1
Folks	1
are	1
different	1
Take	1
you	1
now	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
wrong	1
a	1
man	1
Yes	1
yes	1
good	1
bye	1
said	1
Levin	1
breathless	1
with	1
excitement	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
stick	1
and	1
walked	1
quickly	1
away	1
towards	1
home	1
At	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
words	1
that	1
Fokanitch	1
lived	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
truth	1
in	1
God	1
s	1
way	1
undefined	1
but	1
significant	1
ideas	1
seemed	1
to	1
burst	1
out	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
locked	1
up	1
and	1
all	1
striving	1
towards	1
one	1
goal	1
they	1
thronged	1
whirling	1
through	1
his	1
head	1
blinding	1
him	1
with	1
their	1

Chapter	1
12	1
Levin	1
strode	1
along	1
the	1
highroad	1
absorbed	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
disentangle	1
them	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
unlike	1
anything	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
before	1
The	1
words	1
uttered	1
by	1
the	1
peasant	1
had	1
acted	1
on	1
his	1
soul	1
like	1
an	1
electric	1
shock	1
suddenly	1
transforming	1
and	1
combining	1
into	1
a	1
single	1
whole	1
the	1
whole	1
swarm	1
of	1
disjointed	1
impotent	1
separate	1
thoughts	1
that	1
incessantly	1
occupied	1
his	1
mind	1
These	1
thoughts	1
had	1
unconsciously	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
land	1
He	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
something	1
new	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
joyfully	1
tested	1
this	1
new	1
thing	1
not	1
yet	1
knowing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
Not	1
living	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
wants	1
but	1
for	1
God	1
For	1
what	1
God	1
And	1
could	1
one	1
say	1
anything	1
more	1
senseless	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
not	1
live	1
for	1
one	1
s	1

that	1
is	1
that	1

for	1
what	1
we	1
understand	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
attracted	1
by	1
what	1
we	1
desire	1
but	1
must	1
live	1
for	1
something	1
incomprehensible	1
for	1
God	1
whom	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
understand	1
nor	1
even	1
define	1
What	1
of	1
it	1
Didn	1
t	1
I	1
understand	1
those	1
senseless	1
words	1
of	1
Fyodor	1
s	1
And	1
understanding	1
them	1
did	1
I	1
doubt	1
of	1
their	1
truth	1
Did	1
I	1
think	1
them	1
stupid	1
obscure	1
inexact	1
No	1
I	1
understood	1
him	1
and	1
exactly	1
as	1
he	1
understands	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
understood	1
them	1
more	1
fully	1
and	1
clearly	1
than	1
I	1
understand	1
anything	1
in	1
life	1
and	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
have	1
I	1
doubted	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
doubt	1
about	1
it	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
I	1
but	1
everyone	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
understands	1
nothing	1
fully	1
but	1
this	1
and	1
about	1
this	1
only	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
and	1
are	1
always	1
agreed	1
And	1
I	1
looked	1
out	1
for	1
miracles	1
complained	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
a	1
miracle	1
which	1
would	1
convince	1
me	1
A	1
material	1
miracle	1
would	1
have	1
persuaded	1
me	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
miracle	1
the	1
sole	1
miracle	1
possible	1
continually	1
existing	1
surrounding	1
me	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
noticed	1
it	1
Fyodor	1
says	1
that	1
Kirillov	1
lives	1
for	1
his	1
belly	1
That	1
s	1
comprehensible	1
and	1
rational	1
All	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
rational	1
beings	1
can	1
t	1
do	1
anything	1
else	1
but	1
live	1
for	1
our	1
belly	1
And	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
the	1
same	1
Fyodor	1
says	1
that	1
one	1
mustn	1
t	1
live	1
for	1
one	1
s	1
belly	1
but	1
must	1
live	1
for	1
truth	1
for	1
God	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
hint	1
I	1
understand	1
him	1
And	1
I	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
men	1
who	1
lived	1
ages	1
ago	1
and	1
men	1
living	1
now	1
peasants	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
the	1
learned	1
who	1
have	1
thought	1
and	1
written	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
obscure	1
words	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
agreed	1
about	1
this	1
one	1
thing	1
what	1
we	1
must	1
live	1
for	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
firm	1
incontestable	1
clear	1
knowledge	1
and	1
that	1
knowledge	1
cannot	1
be	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
reason	1
it	1
is	1
outside	1
it	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
causes	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
effects	1
If	1
goodness	1
has	1
causes	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
goodness	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
effects	1
a	1
reward	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
goodness	1
either	1
So	1
goodness	1
is	1
outside	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
it	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
a	1
greater	1
miracle	1
than	1
that	1
Can	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
can	1
my	1
sufferings	1
be	1
over	1
thought	1
Levin	1
striding	1
along	1
the	1
dusty	1
road	1
not	1
noticing	1
the	1
heat	1
nor	1
his	1
weariness	1
and	1
experiencing	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
from	1
prolonged	1
suffering	1
This	1
feeling	1
was	1
so	1
delicious	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
incredible	1
He	1
was	1
breathless	1
with	1
emotion	1
and	1
incapable	1
of	1
going	1
farther	1
he	1
turned	1
off	1
the	1
road	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
an	1
aspen	1
on	1
the	1
uncut	1
grass	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
hat	1
off	1
his	1
hot	1
head	1
and	1
lay	1
propped	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
in	1
the	1
lush	1
feathery	1
woodland	1
grass	1
Yes	1
I	1
must	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
understand	1
he	1
thought	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
the	1
untrampled	1
grass	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
following	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
a	1
green	1
beetle	1
advancing	1
along	1
a	1
blade	1
of	1
couch	1
grass	1
and	1
lifting	1
up	1
in	1
its	1
progress	1
a	1
leaf	1
of	1
goat	1
weed	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
discovered	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
bending	1
aside	1
the	1
leaf	1
of	1
goat	1
weed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
beetle	1
s	1
way	1
and	1
twisting	1
another	1
blade	1
of	1
grass	1
above	1
for	1
the	1
beetle	1
to	1
cross	1
over	1
onto	1
it	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
glad	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
discovered	1
I	1
have	1
discovered	1
nothing	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
found	1
out	1
what	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
force	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
gave	1
me	1
life	1
and	1
now	1
too	1
gives	1
me	1
life	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
free	1
from	1
falsity	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
Master	1
Of	1
old	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
grass	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
beetle	1
there	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
the	1
grass	1
she	1
s	1
opened	1
her	1
wings	1
and	1
flown	1
away	1
there	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
transformation	1
of	1
matter	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
physical	1
chemical	1
and	1
physiological	1
laws	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
aspens	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
and	1
the	1
misty	1
patches	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
evolution	1
Evolution	1
from	1
what	1
into	1
what	1
Eternal	1
evolution	1
and	1
struggle	1
As	1
though	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
tendency	1
and	1
struggle	1
in	1
the	1
eternal	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
astonished	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
effort	1
of	1
thought	1
along	1
that	1
road	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
discover	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
my	1
impulses	1
and	1
yearnings	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
To	1
live	1
for	1
God	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
And	1
this	1
meaning	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
clearness	1
is	1
mysterious	1
and	1
marvelous	1
Such	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
everything	1
existing	1
Yes	1
pride	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
turning	1
over	1
on	1
his	1
stomach	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
tie	1
a	1
noose	1
of	1
blades	1
of	1
grass	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
them	1
And	1
not	1
merely	1
pride	1
of	1
intellect	1
but	1
dulness	1
of	1
intellect	1
And	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
yes	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
intellect	1
The	1
cheating	1
knavishness	1
of	1
intellect	1
that	1
s	1
it	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
And	1
he	1
briefly	1
went	1
through	1
mentally	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
ideas	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
clear	1
confronting	1
of	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
brother	1
hopelessly	1
ill	1
Then	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
grasping	1
that	1
for	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
himself	1
too	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
store	1
but	1
suffering	1
death	1
and	1
forgetfulness	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
impossible	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
either	1
interpret	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
present	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
evil	1
jest	1
of	1
some	1
devil	1
or	1
shoot	1
himself	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
either	1
but	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
living	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
time	1
married	1
and	1
had	1
had	1
many	1
joys	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
happy	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
What	1
did	1
this	1
mean	1
It	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
living	1
rightly	1
but	1
thinking	1
wrongly	1
He	1
had	1
lived	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
those	1
spiritual	1
truths	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sucked	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
s	1
milk	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
not	1
merely	1
without	1
recognition	1
of	1
these	1
truths	1
but	1
studiously	1
ignoring	1
them	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
live	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
beliefs	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
What	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
how	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
my	1
life	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
these	1
beliefs	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
live	1
for	1
God	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
desires	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
robbed	1
and	1
lied	1
and	1
killed	1
Nothing	1
of	1
what	1
makes	1
the	1
chief	1
happiness	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
would	1
have	1
existed	1
for	1
me	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
stretch	1
of	1
imagination	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
the	1
brutal	1
creature	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
himself	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
for	1
I	1
looked	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
question	1
And	1
thought	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
question	1
it	1
is	1
incommensurable	1
with	1
my	1
question	1
The	1
answer	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
me	1
by	1
life	1
itself	1
in	1
my	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
wrong	1
And	1
that	1
knowledge	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
arrive	1
at	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
given	1
because	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
from	1
anywhere	1
Where	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
By	1
reason	1
could	1
I	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
love	1
my	1
neighbor	1
and	1
not	1
oppress	1
him	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
childhood	1
and	1
I	1
believed	1
it	1
gladly	1
for	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
But	1
who	1
discovered	1
it	1
Not	1
reason	1
Reason	1
discovered	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
requires	1
us	1
to	1
oppress	1
all	1
who	1
hinder	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
our	1
desires	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
deduction	1
of	1
reason	1
But	1
loving	1
one	1

neighbor	1
reason	1
could	1
never	1
discover	1

Chapter	1
13	1
And	1
Levin	1
remembered	1
a	1
scene	1
he	1
had	1
lately	1
witnessed	1
between	1
Dolly	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
The	1
children	1
left	1
to	1
themselves	1
had	1
begun	1
cooking	1
raspberries	1
over	1
the	1
candles	1
and	1
squirting	1
milk	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
mouths	1
with	1
a	1
syringe	1
Their	1
mother	1
catching	1
them	1
at	1
these	1
pranks	1
began	1
reminding	1
them	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
trouble	1
their	1
mischief	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
grown	1
up	1
people	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
trouble	1
was	1
all	1
for	1
their	1
sake	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
smashed	1
the	1
cups	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
drink	1
their	1
tea	1
out	1
of	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
wasted	1
the	1
milk	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
die	1
of	1
hunger	1
And	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
passive	1
weary	1
incredulity	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
heard	1
what	1
their	1
mother	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
They	1
were	1
simply	1
annoyed	1
that	1
their	1
amusing	1
play	1
had	1
been	1
interrupted	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
saying	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
indeed	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
immensity	1
of	1
all	1
they	1
habitually	1
enjoyed	1
and	1
so	1
