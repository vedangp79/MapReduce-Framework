CONCLUDING	1
NOTE	1
We	1
have	1
now	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Iliad	1
and	1
seen	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
Achilles	1
and	1
the	1
terrible	1
effects	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
as	1
that	1
only	1
was	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
poem	1
and	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
epic	1
poetry	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
our	1
author	1
to	1
proceed	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
it	1
perhaps	1
may	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
reader	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
short	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1

in	1

I	1

moderate	1

on	1
the	1

as	1
any	1
of	1
the	1

hitherto	1
put	1

In	1

they	1
consist	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
blend	1
those	1
hypotheses	1
into	1
something	1
like	1
consistency	1

It	1
is	1
indeed	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
calculate	1
the	1
height	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
memory	1
may	1
be	1
cultivated	1
To	1
take	1
an	1
ordinary	1
case	1
we	1
might	1
refer	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
first	1

be	1

parts	1
which	1
when	1
laid	1
together	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
lines	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
two	1
instances	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
day	1
Visiting	1
at	1
Naples	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
intellectual	1
attainments	1
and	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
distinguished	1
rank	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
letters	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
century	1
he	1
informed	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
much	1
time	1
in	1
examining	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
highly	1
educated	1
who	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
repeat	1
the	1
whole	1
Gierusalemme	1
of	1
Tasso	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
recite	1
it	1
consecutively	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
repeat	1
those	1
stanzas	1
in	1
utter	1
defiance	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
either	1
forwards	1
or	1
backwards	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
eighth	1
line	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
alternately	1
the	1
odd	1
and	1
even	1
lines^a	1
in	1
short	1
whatever	1
the	1
passage	1
required	1
the	1
memory	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
cling	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
had	1
it	1
at	1
such	1
perfect	1
command	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
produce	1
it	1
under	1
any	1
form	1
Our	1
informant	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
state	1
that	1
this	1
singular	1
being	1
was	1
proceeding	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
Orlando	1
Furioso	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
But	1
even	1
this	1
instance	1
is	1
less	1
wonderful	1
than	1
one	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
appeal	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
readers	1
that	1
happened	1

twenty	1

	1

on	1

such	1

the	1

oeSome	1

of	1
the	1

sides	1
of	1

character	1
is	1
the	1
readiness	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
lent	1
itself	1
to	1
construct	1
intimate	1
and	1
durable	1
friendships	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
feature	1
no	1
less	1
prominent	1
in	1
the	1
earliest	1
than	1
in	1
later	1
times	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
comparatively	1
low	1
estimation	1
in	1
which	1
female	1
society	1
was	1
held	1
but	1
the	1
devotedness	1
and	1
constancy	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
attachments	1
were	1
maintained	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
admirable	1
and	1
engaging	1
The	1
heroic	1
companions	1
whom	1
we	1
find	1
celebrated	1
partly	1
by	1
Homer	1
and	1
partly	1
in	1
traditions	1
which	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
equal	1
antiquity	1
were	1
grounded	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
with	1
scarcely	1
a	1
wish	1
or	1
object	1
apart	1
and	1
only	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
one	1
another	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
them	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
one	1
of	1
perfect	1
equality	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
while	1
it	1
often	1
adds	1
a	1
peculiar	1
charm	1
to	1
the	1
poetical	1
description	1
detracts	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
idea	1
which	1
it	1
presents	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
friendships	1
of	1
Hercules	1
and	1
Iolaus	1

Theseus	1
and	1
Pirithous	1

though	1
These	1
may	1
owe	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
fame	1
to	1
the	1
later	1
epic	1
or	1
even	1
dramatic	1
poetry	1
the	1
moral	1
groundwork	1
undoubtedly	1
subsisted	1
in	1
the	1
period	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
traditions	1
are	1
referred	1
The	1
argument	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
mainly	1
turns	1
on	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
Achilles	1
for	1
Patroclus	1
whose	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
greater	1
hero	1
is	1
only	1
tempered	1
by	1
reverence	1
for	1
his	1
higher	1
birth	1
and	1
his	1
unequalled	1
prowess	1
But	1
the	1
mutual	1
regard	1
which	1
united	1
Idomeneus	1
and	1
Meriones	1
Diomedes	1
and	1
Sthenelus	1
though	1

the	1

character	1
of	1

it	1

necessary	1
that	1
the	1

of	1

should	1

it	1
constantly	1
in	1

A	1

instance	1
in	1
the	1

itself	1
to	1
illustrate	1
this	1
position	1
is	1
the	1
