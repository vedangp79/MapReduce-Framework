could	1
not	1
conceive	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
destroying	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
they	1
lived	1
by	1
That	1
all	1
comes	1
of	1
itself	1
they	1
thought	1
and	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
interesting	1
or	1
important	1
about	1
it	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
so	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
And	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
always	1
the	1
same	1
We	1
ve	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
ready	1
But	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
invent	1
something	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
and	1
new	1
So	1
we	1
thought	1
of	1
putting	1
raspberries	1
in	1
a	1
cup	1
and	1
cooking	1
them	1
over	1
a	1
candle	1
and	1
squirting	1
milk	1
straight	1
into	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
mouths	1
That	1
s	1
fun	1
and	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
worse	1
than	1
drinking	1
out	1
of	1
cups	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
searching	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
thought	1
And	1
don	1
t	1
all	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
philosophy	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
trying	1
by	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
thought	1
which	1
is	1
strange	1
and	1
not	1
natural	1
to	1
man	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
known	1
long	1
ago	1
and	1
knows	1
so	1
certainly	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
at	1
all	1
without	1
it	1
Isn	1
t	1
it	1
distinctly	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
each	1
philosopher	1
s	1
theory	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
significance	1
of	1
life	1
beforehand	1
just	1
as	1
positively	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
Fyodor	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
he	1
and	1
is	1
simply	1
trying	1
by	1
a	1
dubious	1
intellectual	1
path	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
what	1
everyone	1
knows	1
Now	1
then	1
leave	1
the	1
children	1
to	1
themselves	1
to	1
get	1
things	1
alone	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
crockery	1
get	1
the	1
milk	1
from	1
the	1
cows	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
Would	1
they	1
be	1
naughty	1
then	1
Why	1
they	1
d	1
die	1
of	1
hunger	1
Well	1
then	1
leave	1
us	1
with	1
our	1
passions	1
and	1
thoughts	1
without	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Creator	1
or	1
without	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
without	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
moral	1
evil	1
Just	1
try	1
and	1
build	1
up	1
anything	1
without	1
those	1
ideas	1
We	1
only	1
try	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
because	1
we	1
re	1
spiritually	1
provided	1
for	1
Exactly	1
like	1
the	1
children	1
Whence	1
have	1
I	1
that	1
joyful	1
knowledge	1
shared	1
with	1
the	1
peasant	1
that	1
alone	1
gives	1
peace	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
Whence	1
did	1
I	1
get	1
it	1
Brought	1
up	1
with	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
God	1
a	1
Christian	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
spiritual	1
blessings	1
Christianity	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
full	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
living	1
on	1
those	1
blessings	1
like	1
the	1
children	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
and	1
destroy	1
that	1
is	1
try	1
to	1
destroy	1
what	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
important	1
moment	1
of	1
life	1
comes	1
like	1
the	1
children	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
cold	1
and	1
hungry	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
Him	1
and	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
when	1
their	1
mother	1
scolds	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
childish	1
mischief	1
do	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
my	1
childish	1
efforts	1
at	1
wanton	1
madness	1
are	1
reckoned	1
against	1
me	1
Yes	1
what	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
by	1
reason	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
heart	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
taught	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
The	1
church	1
the	1
church	1
Levin	1
repeated	1
to	1
himself	1
He	1
turned	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
fell	1
to	1
gazing	1
into	1
the	1
distance	1
at	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
crossing	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
But	1
can	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
church	1
teaches	1
he	1
thought	1
trying	1
himself	1
and	1
thinking	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
destroy	1
his	1
present	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
Intentionally	1
he	1
recalled	1
all	1
those	1
doctrines	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
most	1
strange	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
stumbling	1
block	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
Creation	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
I	1
explain	1
existence	1
By	1
existence	1
By	1
nothing	1
The	1
devil	1
and	1
sin	1
But	1
how	1
do	1
I	1
explain	1
evil	1
The	1
atonement	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
nothing	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
know	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
And	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
article	1
of	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
could	1
destroy	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
faith	1
in	1
God	1
in	1
goodness	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
goal	1
of	1
man	1
s	1
destiny	1
Under	1
every	1
article	1
of	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
could	1
be	1
put	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
truth	1
instead	1
of	1
one	1
s	1
desires	1
And	1
each	1
doctrine	1
did	1
not	1
simply	1
leave	1
that	1
faith	1
unshaken	1
each	1
doctrine	1
seemed	1
essential	1
to	1
complete	1
that	1
great	1
miracle	1
continually	1
manifest	1
upon	1
earth	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
each	1
man	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
different	1
sorts	1
of	1
men	1
wise	1
men	1
and	1
imbeciles	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
children	1
all	1
men	1

Lvov	1
Kitty	1
beggars	1
and	1
kings	1
to	1
understand	1
perfectly	1
the	1
same	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
thereby	1
that	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
which	1
alone	1
is	1
worth	1
living	1
and	1
which	1
alone	1
is	1
precious	1
to	1
us	1
Lying	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
he	1
gazed	1
up	1
now	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
cloudless	1
sky	1
Do	1
I	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
infinite	1
space	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
round	1
arch	1
But	1
however	1
I	1
screw	1
up	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
strain	1
my	1
sight	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
it	1
not	1
round	1
and	1
not	1
bounded	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
knowing	1
about	1
infinite	1
space	1
I	1
am	1
incontestably	1
right	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
solid	1
blue	1
dome	1
and	1
more	1
right	1
than	1
when	1
I	1
strain	1
my	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
beyond	1
it	1
Levin	1
ceased	1
thinking	1
and	1
only	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
listened	1
to	1
mysterious	1
voices	1
that	1
seemed	1
talking	1
joyfully	1
and	1
earnestly	1
within	1
him	1
Can	1
this	1
be	1
faith	1
he	1
thought	1
afraid	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
happiness	1
My	1
God	1
I	1
thank	1
Thee	1
he	1
said	1
gulping	1
down	1
his	1
sobs	1
and	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
brushing	1
away	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
eyes	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Levin	1
looked	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
cattle	1
then	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
trap	1
with	1
Raven	1
in	1
the	1
shafts	1
and	1
the	1
coachman	1
who	1
driving	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
herd	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
herdsman	1
Then	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
snort	1
of	1
the	1
sleek	1
horse	1
close	1
by	1
him	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wonder	1
why	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
him	1
He	1
only	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
driven	1
quite	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
The	1
mistress	1
sent	1
me	1
Your	1
brother	1
has	1
come	1
and	1
some	1
gentleman	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
reins	1
As	1
though	1
just	1
roused	1
out	1
of	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Levin	1
could	1
not	1
collect	1
his	1
faculties	1
He	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
sleek	1
horse	1
flecked	1
with	1
lather	1
between	1
his	1
haunches	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
where	1
the	1
harness	1
rubbed	1
stared	1
at	1
Ivan	1
the	1
coachman	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
expecting	1
his	1
brother	1
thought	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
most	1
likely	1
uneasy	1
at	1
his	1
long	1
absence	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
guess	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
visitor	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
And	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
unknown	1
guest	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
before	1
He	1
fancied	1
that	1
now	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
all	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
different	1
With	1
my	1
brother	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
of	1
that	1
aloofness	1
there	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
between	1
us	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
disputes	1
with	1
Kitty	1
there	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
quarrels	1
with	1
the	1
visitor	1
whoever	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
friendly	1
and	1
nice	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
with	1
Ivan	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
different	1
Pulling	1
the	1
stiff	1
rein	1
and	1
holding	1
in	1
the	1
good	1
horse	1
that	1
snorted	1
with	1
impatience	1
and	1
seemed	1
begging	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
go	1
Levin	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Ivan	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
unoccupied	1
hand	1
continually	1
pressing	1
down	1
his	1
shirt	1
as	1
it	1
puffed	1
out	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
Ivan	1
had	1
pulled	1
the	1
saddle	1
girth	1
up	1
too	1
high	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
blame	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
for	1
friendly	1
warm	1
talk	1
Nothing	1
else	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
Your	1
honor	1
must	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
mind	1
that	1
stump	1
said	1
the	1
coachman	1
pulling	1
the	1
rein	1
Levin	1
held	1
Please	1
don	1
t	1
touch	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
teach	1
me	1
said	1
Levin	1
angered	1
by	1
this	1
interference	1
Now	1
as	1
always	1
interference	1
made	1
him	1
angry	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
sorrowfully	1
at	1
once	1
how	1
mistaken	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
supposition	1
that	1
his	1
spiritual	1
condition	1
could	1
immediately	1
change	1
him	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
reality	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
home	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Grisha	1
and	1
Tanya	1
running	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
Uncle	1
Kostya	1
mamma	1
s	1
coming	1
and	1
grandfather	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
someone	1
else	1
they	1
said	1
clambering	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
An	1
awfully	1
terrible	1
person	1
And	1
he	1
does	1
like	1
this	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
said	1
Tanya	1
getting	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
mimicking	1
Katavasov	1
Old	1
or	1
young	1
asked	1
Levin	1
laughing	1
reminded	1
of	1
someone	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
by	1
Tanya	1
s	1
performance	1
Oh	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
tiresome	1
person	1
thought	1
Levin	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
at	1
a	1
bend	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
party	1
coming	1
Levin	1
recognized	1
Katavasov	1
in	1
a	1
straw	1
hat	1
walking	1
along	1
swinging	1
his	1
arms	1
just	1
as	1
Tanya	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
Katavasov	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
discussing	1
metaphysics	1
having	1
derived	1
his	1
notions	1
from	1
natural	1
science	1
writers	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
studied	1
metaphysics	1
and	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Levin	1
had	1
had	1
many	1
arguments	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
late	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
arguments	1
in	1
which	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
obviously	1
considered	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
off	1
victorious	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
Levin	1
thought	1
of	1
as	1
he	1
recognized	1
him	1
No	1
whatever	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
argue	1
and	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
my	1
ideas	1
lightly	1
he	1
thought	1
Getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
greeting	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
Levin	1
asked	1
about	1
his	1
wife	1
She	1
has	1
taken	1
Mitya	1
to	1
Kolok	1
a	1
copse	1
near	1
the	1
house	1
She	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
out	1
there	1
because	1
it	1
s	1
so	1
hot	1
indoors	1
said	1
Dolly	1
Levin	1
had	1
always	1
advised	1
his	1
wife	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
baby	1
to	1
the	1
wood	1
thinking	1
it	1
unsafe	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
pleased	1
to	1
hear	1
this	1
She	1
rushes	1
about	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
with	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
smiling	1
I	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
putting	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ice	1
cellar	1
She	1
meant	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
She	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
there	1
We	1
are	1
going	1
there	1
said	1
Dolly	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
falling	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
walking	1
beside	1
him	1
Oh	1
nothing	1
special	1
Busy	1
as	1
usual	1
with	1
the	1
land	1
answered	1
Levin	1
Well	1
and	1
what	1
about	1
you	1
Come	1
for	1
long	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
expecting	1
you	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Only	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
I	1
ve	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
Moscow	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
brothers	1
eyes	1
met	1
and	1
Levin	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
desire	1
he	1
always	1
had	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
affectionate	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
open	1
terms	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
felt	1
an	1
awkwardness	1
in	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
He	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
Casting	1
over	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
conversation	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
pleasant	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
would	1
keep	1
him	1
off	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
Servian	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
question	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hinted	1
by	1
the	1
allusion	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
Moscow	1
Levin	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
book	1
Well	1
have	1
there	1
been	1
reviews	1
of	1
your	1
book	1
he	1
asked	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
intentional	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
No	1
one	1
is	1
interested	1
in	1
that	1
now	1
and	1
I	1
less	1
than	1
anyone	1
he	1
said	1
Just	1
look	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
shower	1
he	1
added	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
sunshade	1
at	1
the	1
white	1
rain	1
clouds	1
that	1
showed	1
above	1
the	1
aspen	1
tree	1
tops	1
And	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
re	1
establish	1
again	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
that	1
tone	1
hardly	1
hostile	1
but	1
chilly	1
which	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
longing	1
to	1
avoid	1
Levin	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Katavasov	1
It	1
was	1
jolly	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
Now	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
some	1
discussion	1
we	1
ll	1
see	1
to	1
that	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
reading	1
Spencer	1
No	1
I	1
ve	1
not	1
finished	1
reading	1
him	1
said	1
Levin	1
But	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
need	1
him	1
now	1
How	1
s	1
that	1
that	1
s	1
interesting	1
Why	1
so	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
I	1
m	1
fully	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problems	1
that	1
interest	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
like	1
Now	1
But	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
serene	1
and	1
good	1
humored	1
expression	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
tenderness	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
happy	1
mood	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
unmistakably	1
disturbing	1
by	1
this	1
conversation	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
resolution	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
But	1
we	1
ll	1
talk	1
later	1
on	1
he	1
added	1
If	1
we	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
it	1
s	1
this	1
way	1
along	1
this	1
little	1
path	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
them	1
all	1
Going	1
along	1
the	1
narrow	1
path	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
uncut	1
meadow	1
covered	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
thick	1
clumps	1
of	1
brilliant	1
heart	1
s	1
ease	1
among	1
which	1
stood	1
up	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
tall	1
dark	1
green	1
tufts	1
of	1
hellebore	1
Levin	1
settled	1
his	1
guests	1
in	1
the	1
dense	1
cool	1
shade	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
aspens	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
and	1
some	1
stumps	1
purposely	1
put	1
there	1
for	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
bee	1
house	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
bees	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
to	1
get	1
bread	1
cucumbers	1
and	1
fresh	1
honey	1
to	1
regale	1
them	1
with	1
Trying	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
movements	1
as	1
deliberate	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
bees	1
that	1
buzzed	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
frequently	1
past	1
him	1
he	1
walked	1
along	1
the	1
little	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
entry	1
one	1
bee	1
hummed	1
angrily	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
beard	1
but	1
he	1
carefully	1
extricated	1
it	1
Going	1
into	1
the	1
shady	1
outer	1
room	1
he	1
took	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
his	1
veil	1
that	1
hung	1
on	1
a	1
peg	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
pockets	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
fenced	1
in	1
bee	1
garden	1
where	1
there	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
closely	1
mown	1
space	1
in	1
regular	1
rows	1
fastened	1
with	1
bast	1
on	1
posts	1
all	1
the	1
hives	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
the	1
old	1
stocks	1
each	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
history	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
fences	1
the	1
younger	1
swarms	1
hived	1
that	1
year	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
openings	1
of	1
the	1
hives	1
it	1
made	1
his	1
eyes	1
giddy	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
bees	1
and	1
drones	1
whirling	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
while	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
working	1
bees	1
flew	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
with	1
spoils	1
or	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
them	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
to	1
the	1
flowering	1
lime	1
trees	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
hives	1
His	1
ears	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
incessant	1
hum	1
in	1
various	1
notes	1
now	1
the	1
busy	1
hum	1
of	1
the	1
working	1
bee	1
flying	1
quickly	1
off	1
then	1
the	1
blaring	1
of	1
the	1
lazy	1
drone	1
and	1
the	1
excited	1
buzz	1
of	1
the	1
bees	1
on	1
guard	1
protecting	1
their	1
property	1
from	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
sting	1
On	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fence	1
the	1
old	1
bee	1
keeper	1
was	1
shaving	1
a	1
hoop	1
for	1
a	1
tub	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
Levin	1
Levin	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
beehives	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
to	1
recover	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
ordinary	1
actual	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
depressed	1
his	1
happy	1
mood	1
He	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
temper	1
with	1
Ivan	1
to	1
show	1
coolness	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
talk	1
flippantly	1
with	1
Katavasov	1
Can	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
momentary	1
mood	1
and	1
will	1
it	1
pass	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
trace	1
he	1
thought	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
mood	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
delight	1
that	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
important	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
Real	1
life	1
had	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
overcast	1
the	1
spiritual	1
peace	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
untouched	1
within	1
him	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
bees	1
whirling	1
round	1
him	1
now	1
menacing	1
him	1
and	1
distracting	1
his	1
attention	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
enjoying	1
complete	1
physical	1
peace	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
movements	1
to	1
avoid	1
them	1
so	1
had	1
the	1
petty	1
cares	1
that	1
had	1
swarmed	1
about	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
restricted	1
his	1
spiritual	1
freedom	1
but	1
that	1
lasted	1
only	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
Just	1
as	1
his	1
bodily	1
strength	1
was	1
still	1
unaffected	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
bees	1
so	1
too	1
was	1
the	1
spiritual	1
strength	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
become	1
aware	1
of	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Kostya	1
with	1
whom	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
traveled	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
here	1
said	1
Dolly	1
doling	1
out	1
cucumbers	1
and	1
honey	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
with	1
Vronsky	1
He	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
Servia	1
And	1
not	1
alone	1
he	1
s	1
taking	1
a	1
squadron	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
expense	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
That	1
s	1
the	1
right	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
said	1
Levin	1
Are	1
volunteers	1
still	1
going	1
out	1
then	1
he	1
added	1
glancing	1
at	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
He	1
was	1
carefully	1
with	1
a	1
blunt	1
knife	1
getting	1
a	1
live	1
bee	1
covered	1
with	1
sticky	1
honey	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
cup	1
full	1
of	1
white	1
honeycomb	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
so	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
yesterday	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
biting	1
with	1
a	1
juicy	1
sound	1
into	1
a	1
cucumber	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
one	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
For	1
mercy	1
s	1
sake	1
do	1
explain	1
to	1
me	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
where	1
are	1
all	1
those	1
volunteers	1
going	1
whom	1
are	1
they	1
fighting	1
with	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
unmistakably	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
in	1
Levin	1
s	1
absence	1
With	1
the	1
Turks	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
answered	1
smiling	1
serenely	1
as	1
he	1
extricated	1
the	1
bee	1
dark	1
with	1
honey	1
and	1
helplessly	1
kicking	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
knife	1
on	1
a	1
stout	1
aspen	1
leaf	1
But	1
who	1
has	1
declared	1
war	1
on	1
the	1
Turks	1
Ivan	1
Ivanovitch	1
Ragozov	1
and	1
Countess	1
Lidia	1
Ivanovna	1
assisted	1
by	1
Madame	1
Stahl	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
declared	1
war	1
but	1
people	1
sympathize	1
with	1
their	1
neighbors	1
sufferings	1
and	1
are	1
eager	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
But	1
the	1
prince	1
is	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
help	1
said	1
Levin	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
but	1
of	1
war	1
The	1
prince	1
says	1
that	1
private	1
persons	1
cannot	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
war	1
without	1
the	1
permission	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
Kostya	1
mind	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
bee	1
Really	1
they	1
ll	1
sting	1
us	1
said	1
Dolly	1
waving	1
away	1
a	1
wasp	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
bee	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
wasp	1
said	1
Levin	1
Well	1
now	1
well	1
what	1
s	1
your	1
own	1
theory	1
Katavasov	1
said	1
to	1
Levin	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
distinctly	1
challenging	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
discussion	1
Why	1
have	1
not	1
private	1
persons	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
Oh	1
my	1
theory	1
s	1
this	1
war	1
is	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
such	1
a	1
beastly	1
cruel	1
and	1
awful	1
thing	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
Christian	1
can	1
individually	1
take	1
upon	1
himself	1
the	1
responsibility	1
of	1
beginning	1
wars	1
that	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
government	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
is	1
driven	1
inevitably	1
into	1
war	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
both	1
political	1
science	1
and	1
common	1
sense	1
teach	1
us	1
that	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
state	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
war	1
private	1
citizens	1
must	1
forego	1
their	1
personal	1
individual	1
will	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
had	1
their	1
replies	1
ready	1
and	1
both	1
began	1
speaking	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
But	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
cases	1
when	1
the	1
government	1
does	1
not	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
public	1
asserts	1
its	1
will	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
But	1
evidently	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
this	1
answer	1
His	1
brows	1
contracted	1
at	1
Katavasov	1
s	1
words	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
else	1
You	1
don	1
t	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
its	1
true	1
light	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
question	1
here	1
of	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
war	1
but	1
simply	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
Christian	1
feeling	1
Our	1
brothers	1
one	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
religion	1
and	1
in	1
race	1
are	1
being	1
massacred	1
Even	1
supposing	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
our	1
brothers	1
nor	1
fellow	1
Christians	1
but	1
simply	1
children	1
women	1
old	1
people	1
feeling	1
is	1
aroused	1
and	1
Russians	1
go	1
eagerly	1
to	1
help	1
in	1
stopping	1
these	1
atrocities	1
Fancy	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
along	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
saw	1
drunken	1
men	1
beating	1
a	1
woman	1
or	1
a	1
child	1
I	1
imagine	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
stop	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
war	1
had	1
been	1
declared	1
on	1
the	1
men	1
but	1
would	1
throw	1
yourself	1
on	1
them	1
and	1
protect	1
the	1
victim	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
kill	1
them	1
said	1
Levin	1
Yes	1
you	1
would	1
kill	1
them	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
If	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
my	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
say	1
beforehand	1
And	1
such	1
a	1
momentary	1
impulse	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
and	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
peoples	1
Possibly	1
for	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
but	1
for	1
others	1
there	1
is	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
frowning	1
with	1
displeasure	1
There	1
are	1
traditions	1
still	1
extant	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Slavs	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
faith	1
suffering	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
unclean	1
sons	1
of	1
Hagar	1
The	1
people	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
and	1
have	1
spoken	1
Perhaps	1
so	1
said	1
Levin	1
evasively	1
but	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
it	1
I	1
m	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
myself	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
feel	1
it	1
Here	1
am	1
I	1
too	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
I	1
ve	1
been	1
staying	1
abroad	1
and	1
reading	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Bulgarian	1
atrocities	1
I	1
couldn	1
t	1
make	1
out	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
their	1
Slavonic	1
brethren	1
while	1
I	1
didn	1
t	1
feel	1
the	1
slightest	1
affection	1
for	1
them	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
upset	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
monster	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
Carlsbad	1
on	1
me	1
But	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
my	1
mind	1
s	1
been	1
set	1
at	1
rest	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
people	1
besides	1
me	1
who	1
re	1
only	1
interested	1
in	1
Russia	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
Slavonic	1
brethren	1
Here	1
s	1
Konstantin	1
too	1
Personal	1
opinions	1
mean	1
nothing	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
personal	1
opinions	1
when	1
all	1
Russia	1
the	1
whole	1
people	1
has	1
expressed	1
its	1
will	1
But	1
excuse	1
me	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
that	1
The	1
people	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
Oh	1
papa	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
And	1
last	1
Sunday	1
in	1
church	1
said	1
Dolly	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
Please	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cloth	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
children	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
Why	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
all	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
in	1
church	1
on	1
Sunday	1
The	1
priest	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
to	1
read	1
that	1
He	1
read	1
it	1
They	1
didn	1
t	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
Then	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
collection	1
for	1
a	1
pious	1
object	1
in	1
church	1
well	1
they	1
pulled	1
out	1
their	1
halfpence	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
but	1
what	1
for	1
they	1
couldn	1
t	1
say	1
The	1
people	1
cannot	1
help	1
knowing	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
destinies	1
is	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
moments	1
as	1
the	1
present	1
that	1
sense	1
finds	1
utterance	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
conviction	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
bee	1
keeper	1
The	1
handsome	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
black	1
grizzled	1
beard	1
and	1
thick	1
silvery	1
hair	1
stood	1
motionless	1
holding	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
honey	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
tall	1
figure	1
with	1
friendly	1
serenity	1
at	1
the	1
gentlefolk	1
obviously	1
understanding	1
nothing	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
and	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
That	1
s	1
so	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
shake	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
words	1
Here	1
then	1
ask	1
him	1
He	1
knows	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
thinks	1
nothing	1
said	1
Levin	1
Have	1
you	1
heard	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
Mihalitch	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
him	1
What	1
they	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
Ought	1
we	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
the	1
Christians	1
What	1
should	1
we	1
think	1
Alexander	1
Nikolaevitch	1
our	1
Emperor	1
has	1
thought	1
for	1
us	1
he	1
thinks	1
for	1
us	1
indeed	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
It	1
s	1
clearer	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
Shall	1
I	1
bring	1
a	1
bit	1
more	1
bread	1
Give	1
the	1
little	1
lad	1
some	1
more	1
he	1
said	1
addressing	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
Grisha	1
who	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
crust	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
are	1
seeing	1
hundreds	1
and	1
hundreds	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
give	1
up	1
everything	1
to	1
serve	1
a	1
just	1
cause	1
come	1
from	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
Russia	1
and	1
directly	1
and	1
clearly	1
express	1
their	1
thought	1
and	1
aim	1
They	1
bring	1
their	1
halfpence	1
or	1
go	1
themselves	1
and	1
say	1
directly	1
what	1
for	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
It	1
means	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
said	1
Levin	1
who	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
warm	1
that	1
among	1
eighty	1
millions	1
of	1
people	1
there	1
can	1
always	1
be	1
found	1
not	1
hundreds	1
as	1
now	1
but	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
lost	1
caste	1
ne	1
er	1
do	1
wells	1
who	1
are	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere	1
to	1
Pogatchev	1
s	1
bands	1
to	1
Khiva	1
to	1
Serbia	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
hundreds	1
or	1
of	1
ne	1
er	1
do	1
wells	1
but	1
the	1
best	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
irritation	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
defending	1
the	1
last	1
penny	1
of	1
his	1
fortune	1
And	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
subscriptions	1
In	1
this	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
whole	1
people	1
directly	1
expressing	1
their	1
will	1
That	1
word	1
people	1
is	1
so	1
vague	1
said	1
Levin	1
Parish	1
clerks	1
teachers	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
maybe	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
s	1
all	1
about	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
eighty	1
millions	1
like	1
Mihalitch	1
far	1
from	1
expressing	1
their	1
will	1
haven	1
t	1
the	1
faintest	1
idea	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
will	1
about	1
What	1
right	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1

Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
being	1
practiced	1
in	1
argument	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
but	1
at	1
once	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
another	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
Oh	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
arithmetical	1
computation	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
it	1
And	1
voting	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
introduced	1
among	1
us	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
introduced	1
for	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
express	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
ways	1
of	1
reaching	1
that	1
It	1
is	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
it	1
is	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
heart	1
I	1
won	1
t	1
speak	1
of	1
those	1
deep	1
currents	1
which	1
are	1
astir	1
in	1
the	1
still	1
ocean	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
evident	1
to	1
every	1
unprejudiced	1
man	1
let	1
us	1
look	1
at	1
society	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
sense	1
All	1
the	1
most	1
diverse	1
sections	1
of	1
the	1
educated	1
public	1
hostile	1
before	1
are	1
merged	1
in	1
one	1
Every	1
division	1
is	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
all	1
the	1
public	1
organs	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
all	1
feel	1
the	1
mighty	1
torrent	1
that	1
has	1
overtaken	1
them	1
and	1
is	1
carrying	1
them	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
Yes	1
all	1
the	1
newspapers	1
do	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
That	1
s	1
true	1
But	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
frogs	1
croak	1
before	1
a	1
storm	1
One	1
can	1
hear	1
nothing	1
for	1
them	1
Frogs	1
or	1
no	1
frogs	1
I	1
m	1
not	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
a	1
paper	1
and	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
defend	1
them	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
unanimity	1
in	1
the	1
intellectual	1
world	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
addressing	1
his	1
brother	1
Levin	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
interrupted	1
him	1
Well	1
about	1
that	1
unanimity	1
that	1
s	1
another	1
thing	1
one	1
may	1
say	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
There	1
s	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
Stepan	1
Arkadyevitch	1
you	1
know	1
him	1
He	1
s	1
got	1
a	1
place	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
committee	1
of	1
a	1
commission	1
and	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
remember	1
Only	1
there	1
s	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
it	1
why	1
Dolly	1
it	1
s	1
no	1
secret	1
and	1
a	1
salary	1
of	1
eight	1
thousand	1
You	1
try	1
asking	1
him	1
whether	1
his	1
post	1
is	1
of	1
use	1
he	1
ll	1
prove	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
most	1
necessary	1
And	1
he	1
s	1
a	1
truthful	1
man	1
too	1
but	1
there	1
s	1
no	1
refusing	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
eight	1
thousand	1
roubles	1
Yes	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
about	1
the	1
post	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
reluctantly	1
feeling	1
the	1
prince	1
s	1
remark	1
to	1
be	1
ill	1
timed	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
unanimity	1
of	1
the	1
press	1
That	1
s	1
been	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
there	1
s	1
war	1
their	1
incomes	1
are	1
doubled	1
How	1
can	1
they	1
help	1
believing	1
in	1
the	1
destinies	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
races	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
care	1
for	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
unjust	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
would	1
only	1
make	1
one	1
condition	1
pursued	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
Alphonse	1
Karr	1
said	1
a	1
capital	1
thing	1
before	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Prussia	1
You	1
consider	1
war	1
to	1
be	1
inevitable	1
Very	1
good	1
Let	1
everyone	1
who	1
advocates	1
war	1
be	1
enrolled	1
in	1
a	1
special	1
regiment	1
of	1
advance	1
guards	1
for	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
every	1
storm	1
of	1
every	1
attack	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
all	1
A	1
nice	1
lot	1
the	1
editors	1
would	1
make	1
said	1
Katavasov	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
roar	1
as	1
he	1
pictured	1
the	1
editors	1
he	1
knew	1
in	1
this	1
picked	1
legion	1
But	1
they	1
d	1
run	1
said	1
Dolly	1
they	1
d	1
only	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
Oh	1
if	1
they	1
ran	1
away	1
then	1
we	1
d	1
have	1
grape	1
shot	1
or	1
Cossacks	1
with	1
whips	1
behind	1
them	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
But	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
joke	1
and	1
a	1
poor	1
one	1
too	1
if	1
you	1
ll	1
excuse	1
my	1
saying	1
so	1
prince	1
said	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
joke	1
that	1
Levin	1
was	1
beginning	1
but	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
interrupted	1
him	1
Every	1
member	1
of	1
society	1
is	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
own	1
special	1
work	1
said	1
he	1
And	1
men	1
of	1
thought	1
are	1
doing	1
their	1
work	1
when	1
they	1
express	1
public	1
opinion	1
And	1
the	1
single	1
hearted	1
and	1
full	1
expression	1
of	1
public	1
opinion	1
is	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
press	1
and	1
a	1
phenomenon	1
to	1
rejoice	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
Twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
silent	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
rise	1
as	1
one	1
man	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
itself	1
for	1
its	1
oppressed	1
brethren	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
step	1
and	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
strength	1
But	1
it	1
s	1
not	1
only	1
making	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
but	1
killing	1
Turks	1
said	1
Levin	1
timidly	1
The	1
people	1
make	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
make	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
their	1
soul	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
murder	1
he	1
added	1
instinctively	1
connecting	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
ideas	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
absorbing	1
his	1
mind	1
For	1
their	1
soul	1
That	1
s	1
a	1

What	1
sort	1
of	1

is	1
the	1

Oh	1
you	1

No	1

I	1
haven	1

Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
rejoined	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
quoting	1
as	1
simply	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
easiest	1
thing	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
very	1
passage	1
that	1
had	1
always	1
puzzled	1
Levin	1
most	1
That	1
s	1
so	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
repeated	1
again	1
He	1
was	1
standing	1
near	1
them	1
and	1
responded	1
to	1
a	1
chance	1
glance	1
turned	1
in	1
his	1
direction	1
Ah	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
you	1
re	1
defeated	1
utterly	1
defeated	1
cried	1
Katavasov	1
good	1
humoredly	1
Levin	1
reddened	1
with	1
vexation	1
not	1
at	1
being	1
defeated	1
but	1
at	1
having	1
failed	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
and	1
being	1
drawn	1
into	1
argument	1
No	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
argue	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
thought	1
they	1
wear	1
impenetrable	1
armor	1
while	1
I	1
m	1
naked	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
convince	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
Katavasov	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
even	1
less	1
possibility	1
of	1
himself	1
agreeing	1
with	1
them	1
What	1
they	1
advocated	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
pride	1
of	1
intellect	1
that	1
had	1
almost	1
been	1
his	1
ruin	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
some	1
dozens	1
of	1
men	1
among	1
them	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
by	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
glib	1
volunteers	1
swarming	1
to	1
the	1
capital	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
and	1
the	1
newspapers	1
were	1
expressing	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
which	1
was	1
expressed	1
in	1
vengeance	1
and	1
murder	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
this	1
because	1
he	1
neither	1
saw	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
among	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
nor	1
found	1
them	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
consider	1
himself	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
making	1
up	1
the	1
Russian	1
people	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
because	1
he	1
like	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
general	1
good	1
could	1
be	1
attained	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
strict	1
observance	1
of	1
that	1
law	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
war	1
or	1
advocate	1
war	1
for	1
any	1
general	1
objects	1
whatever	1
He	1
said	1
as	1
Mihalitch	1
did	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
expressed	1
their	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
traditional	1
invitations	1
of	1
the	1
Varyagi	1
Be	1
princes	1
and	1
rule	1
over	1
us	1
Gladly	1
we	1
promise	1
complete	1
submission	1
All	1
the	1
labor	1
all	1
humiliations	1
all	1
sacrifices	1
we	1
take	1
upon	1
ourselves	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
judge	1
and	1
decide	1
And	1
now	1
according	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
account	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
foregone	1
this	1
privilege	1
they	1
had	1
bought	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
costly	1
price	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
too	1
that	1
if	1
public	1
opinion	1
were	1
an	1
infallible	1
guide	1
then	1
why	1
were	1
not	1
revolutions	1
and	1
the	1
commune	1
as	1
lawful	1
as	1
the	1
movement	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
Slavonic	1
peoples	1
But	1
these	1
were	1
merely	1
thoughts	1
that	1
could	1
settle	1
nothing	1
One	1
thing	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
actual	1
moment	1
the	1
discussion	1
was	1
irritating	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
wrong	1
to	1
continue	1
it	1
And	1
Levin	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
and	1
then	1
called	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
his	1
guests	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
storm	1
clouds	1
were	1
gathering	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
going	1
home	1
before	1
it	1
rained	1
Chapter	1
17	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
and	1
drove	1
off	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
hastened	1
homewards	1
on	1
foot	1
But	1
the	1
storm	1
clouds	1
turning	1
white	1
and	1
then	1
black	1
moved	1
down	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
quicken	1
their	1
pace	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
before	1
the	1
rain	1
The	1
foremost	1
clouds	1
lowering	1
and	1
black	1
as	1
soot	1
laden	1
smoke	1
rushed	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
swiftness	1
over	1
the	1
sky	1
They	1
were	1
still	1
two	1
hundred	1
paces	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
a	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
had	1
already	1
blown	1
up	1
and	1
every	1
second	1
the	1
downpour	1
might	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
The	1
children	1
ran	1
ahead	1
with	1
frightened	1
and	1
gleeful	1
shrieks	1
Darya	1
Alexandrovna	1
struggling	1
painfully	1
with	1
her	1
skirts	1
that	1
clung	1
round	1
her	1
legs	1
was	1
not	1
walking	1
but	1
running	1
her	1
eyes	1

on	1
the	1
children	1
The	1

of	1
the	1
party	1
holding	1
their	1
hats	1
on	1
strode	1
with	1
long	1
steps	1
beside	1
her	1
They	1
were	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
steps	1
when	1
a	1
big	1
drop	1
fell	1
splashing	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
guttering	1
The	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
elders	1
after	1

ran	1
into	1
the	1

of	1

merrily	1
Katerina	1
Alexandrovna	1
Levin	1
asked	1
of	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
who	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
kerchiefs	1
and	1
rugs	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
We	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
you	1
she	1
said	1
And	1
Mitya	1
In	1
the	1
copse	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
with	1
him	1
Levin	1
snatched	1
up	1
the	1
rugs	1
and	1
ran	1
towards	1
the	1
copse	1
In	1
that	1
brief	1
interval	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
storm	1
clouds	1
had	1
moved	1
on	1
covering	1
the	1
sun	1
so	1
completely	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
dark	1
as	1
an	1
eclipse	1
Stubbornly	1
as	1
though	1
insisting	1
on	1
its	1
rights	1
the	1
wind	1
stopped	1
Levin	1
and	1
tearing	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
flowers	1
off	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
and	1
stripping	1
the	1
white	1
birch	1
branches	1
into	1
strange	1
unseemly	1
nakedness	1
it	1
twisted	1
everything	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
acacias	1
flowers	1
burdocks	1
long	1
grass	1
and	1
tall	1
tree	1
tops	1
The	1
peasant	1
girls	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
ran	1
shrieking	1
into	1
shelter	1
in	1
the	1
servants	1
quarters	1
The	1
streaming	1
rain	1
had	1
already	1
flung	1
its	1
white	1
veil	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
distant	1
forest	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
fields	1
close	1
by	1
and	1
was	1
rapidly	1
swooping	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
copse	1
The	1
wet	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
spurting	1
up	1
in	1
tiny	1
drops	1
could	1
be	1
smelt	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
Holding	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
down	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
struggling	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
strove	1
to	1
tear	1
the	1
wraps	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
Levin	1
was	1
moving	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
copse	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
white	1
behind	1
the	1
oak	1
tree	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sudden	1
flash	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
seemed	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
vault	1
of	1
heaven	1
seemed	1
crashing	1
overhead	1
Opening	1
his	1
blinded	1
eyes	1
Levin	1
gazed	1
through	1
the	1
thick	1
veil	1
of	1
rain	1
that	1
separated	1
him	1
now	1
from	1
the	1
copse	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
horror	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
green	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
oak	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
copse	1
uncannily	1
changing	1
its	1
position	1
Can	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
struck	1
Levin	1
hardly	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
when	1
moving	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rapidly	1
the	1
oak	1
tree	1
vanished	1
behind	1
the	1
other	1
trees	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
tree	1
falling	1
upon	1
the	1
others	1
The	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
thunder	1
and	1
the	1
instantaneous	1
chill	1
that	1
ran	1
through	1
him	1
were	1
all	1
merged	1
for	1
Levin	1
in	1
one	1
sense	1
of	1
terror	1
My	1
God	1
my	1
God	1
not	1
on	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
And	1
though	1
he	1
thought	1
at	1
once	1
how	1
senseless	1
was	1
his	1
prayer	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
by	1
the	1
oak	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
now	1
he	1
repeated	1
it	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
utter	1
this	1
senseless	1
prayer	1
Running	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
usually	1
went	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
them	1
there	1
They	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
copse	1
under	1
an	1
old	1
lime	1
tree	1
they	1
were	1
calling	1
him	1
Two	1
figures	1
in	1
dark	1
dresses	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
light	1
summer	1
dresses	1
when	1
they	1
started	1
out	1
were	1
standing	1
bending	1
over	1
something	1
It	1
was	1
Kitty	1
with	1
the	1
nurse	1
The	1
rain	1
was	1
already	1
ceasing	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
light	1
when	1
Levin	1
reached	1
them	1
The	1
nurse	1
was	1
not	1
wet	1
on	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
but	1
Kitty	1
was	1
drenched	1
through	1
and	1
her	1
soaked	1
clothes	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
Though	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
over	1
they	1
still	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
when	1
the	1
storm	1
broke	1
Both	1
stood	1
bending	1
over	1
a	1
perambulator	1
with	1
a	1
green	1
umbrella	1
Alive	1
Unhurt	1
Thank	1
God	1
he	1
said	1
splashing	1
with	1
his	1
soaked	1
boots	1
through	1
the	1
standing	1
water	1
and	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
Kitty	1
s	1
rosy	1
wet	1
face	1
was	1
turned	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
timidly	1
under	1
her	1
shapeless	1
sopped	1
hat	1
Aren	1
t	1
you	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
think	1
how	1
you	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
reckless	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
It	1
wasn	1
t	1
my	1
fault	1
really	1
We	1
were	1
just	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
change	1
him	1
We	1
were	1
just	1
Kitty	1
began	1
defending	1
herself	1
Mitya	1
was	1
unharmed	1
dry	1
and	1
still	1
fast	1
asleep	1
Well	1
thank	1
God	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
I	1

They	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
wet	1
belongings	1
the	1
nurse	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
baby	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
Levin	1
walked	1
beside	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
penitent	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
angry	1
he	1
squeezed	1
her	1
hand	1
when	1
the	1
nurse	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
Chapter	1

During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
extremely	1
different	1
conversations	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
part	1
only	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
top	1
layer	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
disappointment	1
of	1
not	1
finding	1
the	1
change	1
he	1
expected	1
in	1
himself	1
Levin	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
joyfully	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
After	1
the	1
rain	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
wet	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
besides	1
the	1
storm	1
clouds	1
still	1
hung	1
about	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
gathered	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
black	1
and	1
thundery	1
on	1
the	1
rim	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
No	1
more	1
discussions	1
sprang	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
after	1
dinner	1
everyone	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
At	1
first	1
Katavasov	1
amused	1
the	1
ladies	1
by	1
his	1
original	1
jokes	1
which	1
always	1
pleased	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
first	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
him	1
Then	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
about	1
the	1
very	1
interesting	1
observations	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
habits	1
and	1
characteristics	1
of	1
common	1
houseflies	1
and	1
their	1
life	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
too	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
and	1
at	1
tea	1
his	1
brother	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
explain	1
his	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
of	1
the	1
Eastern	1
question	1
and	1
he	1
spoke	1
so	1
simply	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
everyone	1
listened	1
eagerly	1
Kitty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
it	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
give	1
Mitya	1
his	1
bath	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
Kitty	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
sent	1
for	1
Levin	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
Leaving	1
his	1
tea	1
and	1
regretfully	1
interrupting	1
the	1
interesting	1
conversation	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
uneasily	1
wondering	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for	1
as	1
this	1
only	1
happened	1
on	1
important	1
occasions	1
Levin	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nursery	1
Although	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
interested	1
by	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
s	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
epoch	1
in	1
history	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
forty	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
Slavonic	1
race	1
acting	1
with	1
Russia	1
a	1
conception	1
quite	1
new	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
although	1
he	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
uneasy	1
wonder	1
at	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
by	1
Kitty	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
was	1
alone	1
his	1
mind	1
reverted	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
Slav	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
trivial	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
soul	1
that	1
he	1
instantly	1
forgot	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
dropped	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
that	1
morning	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
recall	1
the	1
whole	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
He	1
fell	1
back	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
feeling	1
which	1
had	1
guided	1
him	1
which	1
was	1
connected	1
with	1
those	1
thoughts	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
even	1
stronger	1
and	1
more	1
definite	1
than	1
before	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
previous	1
attempts	1
to	1
find	1
comforting	1
arguments	1
need	1
to	1
revive	1
a	1
whole	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
feeling	1
Now	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
was	1
keener	1
than	1
ever	1
and	1
thought	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
feeling	1
He	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
two	1
stars	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
darkening	1
sky	1
and	1
suddenly	1
he	1
remembered	1
Yes	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
dome	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
deception	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
thought	1
something	1
I	1
shirked	1
facing	1
something	1
he	1
mused	1
But	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
disproving	1
it	1
I	1
have	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
clear	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
he	1
remembered	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
had	1
shirked	1
facing	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
chief	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
Divinity	1
was	1
His	1
revelation	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
this	1
revelation	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
Christian	1
church	1
alone	1
What	1
relation	1
to	1
this	1
revelation	1
have	1
the	1
beliefs	1
of	1
the	1
Buddhists	1
Mohammedans	1
who	1
preached	1
and	1
did	1
good	1
too	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
formulate	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
nursery	1
Kitty	1
was	1
standing	1
with	1
her	1
sleeves	1
tucked	1
up	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
the	1
bath	1
Hearing	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
footstep	1
she	1
turned	1
towards	1
him	1
summoning	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
smile	1
With	1
one	1
hand	1
she	1
was	1
supporting	1
the	1
fat	1
baby	1
that	1
lay	1
floating	1
and	1
sprawling	1
on	1
its	1
back	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
she	1
squeezed	1
the	1
sponge	1
over	1
him	1
Come	1
look	1
look	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
her	1
husband	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
Agafea	1
Mihalovna	1
s	1
right	1
He	1
knows	1
us	1
Mitya	1
had	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
given	1
unmistakable	1
incontestable	1
signs	1
of	1
recognizing	1
all	1
his	1
friends	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Levin	1
approached	1
the	1
bath	1
the	1
experiment	1
was	1
tried	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
completely	1
successful	1
The	1
cook	1
sent	1
for	1
with	1
this	1
object	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
He	1
frowned	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
disapprovingly	1
Kitty	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
propped	1
his	1
little	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
sponge	1
and	1
chirruped	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
queer	1
little	1
contented	1
sound	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
Kitty	1
and	1
the	1
nurse	1
were	1
not	1
alone	1
in	1
their	1
admiration	1
Levin	1
too	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
delighted	1
The	1
baby	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bath	1
drenched	1
with	1
water	1
wrapped	1
in	1
towels	1
dried	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
piercing	1
scream	1
handed	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
Well	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
said	1
Kitty	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
settled	1
herself	1
comfortably	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
place	1
with	1
the	1
baby	1
at	1
her	1
breast	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
It	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
distress	1
me	1
You	1
said	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
feeling	1
for	1
him	1
No	1
did	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
only	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
disappointed	1
What	1
disappointed	1
in	1
him	1
Not	1
disappointed	1
in	1
him	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
feeling	1
I	1
had	1
expected	1
more	1
I	1
had	1
expected	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
new	1
delightful	1
emotion	1
to	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
surprise	1
And	1
then	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
disgust	1
pity	1
She	1
listened	1
attentively	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
while	1
she	1
put	1
back	1
on	1
her	1
slender	1
fingers	1
the	1
rings	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
while	1
giving	1
Mitya	1
his	1
bath	1
And	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
at	1
there	1
being	1
far	1
more	1
apprehension	1
and	1
pity	1
than	1
pleasure	1
Today	1
after	1
that	1
fright	1
during	1
the	1
storm	1
I	1
understand	1
how	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
Kitty	1
s	1
smile	1
was	1
radiant	1
Were	1
you	1
very	1
much	1
frightened	1
she	1
said	1
So	1
was	1
I	1
too	1
but	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
more	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
s	1
over	1
I	1
m	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
oak	1
How	1
nice	1
Katavasov	1
is	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
happy	1
day	1
we	1
ve	1
had	1
altogether	1
And	1
you	1
re	1
so	1
nice	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Ivanovitch	1
when	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
be	1
Well	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
It	1
s	1
always	1
so	1
hot	1
and	1
steamy	1
here	1

the	1
bath	1
Chapter	1
19	1
Going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
being	1
again	1
alone	1
Levin	1
went	1
back	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
thought	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
not	1
clear	1
Instead	1
of	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
heard	1
voices	1
he	1
stopped	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
parapet	1
he	1
gazed	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sky	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
dark	1
now	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
clouds	1
The	1
storm	1
had	1
drifted	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
flashes	1
of	1
lightning	1
and	1
distant	1
thunder	1
from	1
that	1
quarter	1
Levin	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
monotonous	1
drip	1
from	1
the	1
lime	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
triangle	1
of	1
stars	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
with	1
its	1
branches	1
that	1
ran	1
through	1
its	1
midst	1
At	1
each	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
bright	1
stars	1
vanished	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
died	1
away	1
they	1
reappeared	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
hand	1
had	1
flung	1
them	1
back	1
with	1
careful	1
aim	1
Well	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
perplexes	1
me	1
Levin	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
feeling	1
beforehand	1
that	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
his	1
difficulties	1
was	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
soul	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
yet	1
Yes	1
the	1
one	1
unmistakable	1
incontestable	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Divinity	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
right	1
and	1
wrong	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
revelation	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
in	1
myself	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
make	1
myself	1
but	1
whether	1
I	1
will	1
or	1
not	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
one	1
with	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
of	1
believers	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
church	1
Well	1
but	1
the	1
Jews	1
the	1
Mohammedans	1
the	1
Confucians	1
the	1
Buddhists	1
what	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
put	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
had	1
feared	1
to	1
face	1
Can	1
these	1
hundreds	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
that	1
highest	1
blessing	1
without	1
which	1
life	1
has	1
no	1
meaning	1
He	1
pondered	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
immediately	1
corrected	1
himself	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
questioning	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
I	1
am	1
questioning	1
the	1
relation	1
to	1
Divinity	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
different	1
religions	1
of	1
all	1
mankind	1
I	1
am	1
questioning	1
the	1
universal	1
manifestation	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
all	1
those	1
misty	1
blurs	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
about	1
To	1
me	1
individually	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
a	1
knowledge	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
and	1
unattainable	1
by	1
reason	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
am	1
obstinately	1
trying	1
to	1
express	1
that	1
knowledge	1
in	1
reason	1
and	1
words	1
Don	1
t	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
don	1
t	1
move	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
bright	1
planet	1
which	1
had	1
shifted	1
its	1
position	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
topmost	1
twig	1
of	1
the	1
birch	1
tree	1
But	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
I	1
can	1
t	1
picture	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
I	1
m	1
right	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
move	1
And	1
could	1
the	1
astronomers	1
have	1
understood	1
and	1
calculated	1
anything	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
into	1
account	1
all	1
the	1
complicated	1
and	1
varied	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
All	1
the	1
marvelous	1
conclusions	1
they	1
have	1
reached	1
about	1
the	1
distances	1
weights	1
movements	1
and	1
deflections	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
are	1
only	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
apparent	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
about	1
a	1
stationary	1
earth	1
on	1
that	1
very	1
motion	1
I	1
see	1
before	1
me	1
now	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
men	1
during	1
long	1
ages	1
and	1
was	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
alike	1
and	1
can	1
always	1
be	1
trusted	1
And	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
conclusions	1
of	1
the	1
astronomers	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
vain	1
and	1
uncertain	1
if	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
seen	1
heavens	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
meridian	1
and	1
a	1
single	1
horizon	1
so	1
would	1
my	1
conclusions	1
be	1
vain	1
and	1
uncertain	1
if	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
that	1
conception	1
of	1
right	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
alike	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
Christian	1
and	1
which	1
can	1
always	1
be	1
trusted	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
other	1
religions	1
and	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
Divinity	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
decide	1
and	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
deciding	1
Oh	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1
gone	1
in	1
then	1
he	1
heard	1
Kitty	1
s	1
voice	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
worried	1
about	1
anything	1
she	1
said	1
looking	1
intently	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
starlight	1
But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
face	1
if	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
had	1
not	1
hidden	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
revealed	1
it	1
In	1
that	1
flash	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
distinctly	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
calm	1
and	1
happy	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
him	1
She	1
understands	1
he	1
thought	1
she	1
knows	1
what	1
I	1
m	1
thinking	1
about	1
Shall	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
or	1
not	1
Yes	1
I	1
ll	1
tell	1
her	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
speak	1
she	1
began	1

No	1

of	1
it	1
he	1
thought	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
in	1
before	1
him	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
secret	1
for	1
me	1
alone	1
of	1
vital	1
importance	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
not	1
to	1

put	1
into	1

This	1
new	1
feeling	1
has	1
not	1
changed	1
me	1
has	1
not	1
made	1
me	1
happy	1
and	1
enlightened	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
dreamed	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
feeling	1
for	1
my	1
child	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
surprise	1
in	1
this	1
either	1
Faith	1
or	1
not	1
faith	1
I	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
this	1
feeling	1
has	1
come	1
just	1
as	1
imperceptibly	1
through	1
suffering	1
and	1
has	1
taken	1
firm	1
root	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
losing	1
my	1
temper	1
with	1
Ivan	1
the	1
coachman	1
falling	1
into	1
angry	1
discussions	1
expressing	1
my	1
opinions	1
tactlessly	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
wall	1
between	1
the	1
holy	1
of	1
holies	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
other	1
people	1
even	1
my	1
wife	1
I	1
shall	1
still	1
go	1
on	1
scolding	1
her	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
terror	1
and	1
being	1
remorseful	1
for	1
it	1
I	1
shall	1
still	1
be	1
as	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
with	1
my	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
pray	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
still	1
go	1
on	1
praying	1
but	1
my	1
life	1
now	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
apart	1
from	1
anything	1
that	1
can	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
every	1
minute	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
meaningless	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
before	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
positive	1
meaning	1
of	1
goodness	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
it	1

It	1
is	1
a	1
truth	1
universally	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
fortune	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
However	1
little	1
known	1
the	1
feelings	1
or	1
views	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
entering	1
a	1
neighbourhood	1
this	1
truth	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
surrounding	1
families	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
considered	1
the	1
rightful	1
property	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
daughters	1
My	1
dear	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
said	1
his	1
lady	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
day	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
that	1
Netherfield	1
Park	1
is	1
let	1
at	1
last	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
returned	1
she	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
here	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
impatiently	1
You	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
hearing	1
it	1
This	1
was	1
invitation	1
enough	1
Why	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
says	1
that	1
Netherfield	1
is	1
taken	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
large	1
fortune	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
England	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
Monday	1
in	1
a	1
chaise	1
and	1
four	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
delighted	1
with	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
agreed	1
with	1
Mr	1
Morris	1
immediately	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
before	1
Michaelmas	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
next	1
week	1
What	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
Bingley	1
Is	1
he	1
married	1
or	1
single	1
Oh	1
Single	1
my	1
dear	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
A	1
single	1
man	1
of	1
large	1
fortune	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
What	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
for	1
our	1
girls	1
How	1
so	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
affect	1
them	1
My	1
dear	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
replied	1
his	1
wife	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
Is	1
that	1
his	1
design	1
in	1
settling	1
here	1
Design	1
Nonsense	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
therefore	1
you	1
must	1
visit	1
him	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
comes	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
that	1
You	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
may	1
go	1
or	1
you	1
may	1
send	1
them	1
by	1
themselves	1
which	1
perhaps	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
better	1
for	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
may	1
like	1
you	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
My	1
dear	1
you	1
flatter	1
me	1
I	1
certainly	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
beauty	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
extraordinary	1
now	1
When	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
five	1
grown	1
up	1
daughters	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
over	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
beauty	1
In	1
such	1
cases	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
not	1
often	1
much	1
beauty	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
must	1
indeed	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
into	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
engage	1
for	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
But	1
consider	1
your	1
daughters	1
Only	1
think	1
what	1
an	1
establishment	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
merely	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
for	1
in	1
general	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
visit	1
no	1
newcomers	1
Indeed	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
You	1
are	1
over	1
scrupulous	1
surely	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
by	1
you	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
hearty	1
consent	1
to	1
his	1
marrying	1
whichever	1
he	1
chooses	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
though	1
I	1
must	1
throw	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
my	1
little	1
Lizzy	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
Lizzy	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
handsome	1
as	1
Jane	1
nor	1
half	1
so	1
good	1
humoured	1
as	1
Lydia	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
giving	1
her	1
the	1
preference	1
They	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
much	1
to	1
recommend	1
them	1
replied	1
he	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
silly	1
and	1
ignorant	1
like	1
other	1
girls	1
but	1
Lizzy	1
has	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
quickness	1
than	1
her	1
sisters	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
abuse	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
You	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
vexing	1
me	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
compassion	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
nerves	1
You	1
mistake	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
high	1
respect	1
for	1
your	1
nerves	1
They	1
are	1
my	1
old	1
friends	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
mention	1
them	1
with	1
consideration	1
these	1
last	1
twenty	1
years	1
at	1
least	1
Ah	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
suffer	1
But	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
four	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
us	1
if	1
twenty	1
such	1
should	1
come	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
visit	1
them	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
twenty	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
them	1
all	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
was	1
so	1
odd	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
quick	1
parts	1
sarcastic	1
humour	1
reserve	1
and	1
caprice	1
that	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
three	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
had	1
been	1
insufficient	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
wife	1
understand	1
his	1
character	1
Her	1
mind	1
was	1
less	1
difficult	1
to	1
develop	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
mean	1
understanding	1
little	1
information	1
and	1
uncertain	1
temper	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
discontented	1
she	1
fancied	1
herself	1
nervous	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
daughters	1
married	1
its	1
solace	1
was	1
visiting	1
and	1
news	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
earliest	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
intended	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
though	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
always	1
assuring	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
evening	1
after	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
paid	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
then	1
disclosed	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner	1
Observing	1
his	1
second	1
daughter	1
employed	1
in	1
trimming	1
a	1
hat	1
he	1
suddenly	1
addressed	1
her	1
with	1
I	1
hope	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
will	1
like	1
it	1
Lizzy	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
likes	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
resentfully	1
since	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
visit	1
But	1
you	1
forget	1
mamma	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
assemblies	1
and	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
promised	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
will	1
do	1
any	1
such	1
thing	1
She	1
has	1
two	1
nieces	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
selfish	1
hypocritical	1
woman	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
No	1
more	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
her	1
serving	1
you	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
deigned	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
reply	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
contain	1
herself	1
began	1
scolding	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
Don	1
t	1
keep	1
coughing	1
so	1
Kitty	1
for	1
Heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
Have	1
a	1
little	1
compassion	1
on	1
my	1
nerves	1
You	1
tear	1
them	1
to	1
pieces	1
Kitty	1
has	1
no	1
discretion	1
in	1
her	1
coughs	1
said	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
times	1
them	1
ill	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
cough	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
amusement	1
replied	1
Kitty	1
fretfully	1
When	1
is	1
your	1
next	1
ball	1
to	1
be	1
Lizzy	1
To	1
morrow	1
fortnight	1
Aye	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
cried	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
for	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
herself	1
Then	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
your	1
friend	1
and	1
introduce	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
to	1
her	1
Impossible	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
impossible	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
myself	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
teasing	1
I	1
honour	1
your	1
circumspection	1
A	1
fortnight	1
s	1
acquaintance	1
is	1
certainly	1
very	1
little	1
One	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
really	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
fortnight	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
venture	1
somebody	1
else	1
will	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
and	1
her	1
nieces	1
must	1
stand	1
their	1
chance	1
and	1
therefore	1
as	1
she	1
will	1
think	1
it	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
kindness	1
if	1
you	1
decline	1
the	1
office	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
myself	1
The	1
girls	1
stared	1
at	1
their	1
father	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
said	1
only	1
Nonsense	1
nonsense	1
What	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
emphatic	1
exclamation	1
cried	1
he	1
Do	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
introduction	1
and	1
the	1
stress	1
that	1
is	1
laid	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
nonsense	1
I	1
cannot	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
there	1
What	1
say	1
you	1
Mary	1
For	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
deep	1
reflection	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
read	1
great	1
books	1
and	1
make	1
extracts	1
Mary	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
sensible	1
but	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
While	1
Mary	1
is	1
adjusting	1
her	1
ideas	1
he	1
continued	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
but	1
why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
before	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
as	1
much	1
this	1
morning	1
I	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
called	1
on	1
him	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
unlucky	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
actually	1
paid	1
the	1
visit	1
we	1
cannot	1
escape	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
now	1
The	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wished	1
that	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
perhaps	1
surpassing	1
the	1
rest	1
though	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
tumult	1
of	1
joy	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
How	1
good	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
But	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
should	1
persuade	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
you	1
loved	1
your	1
girls	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
neglect	1
such	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
Well	1
how	1
pleased	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
too	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
this	1
morning	1
and	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
now	1
Now	1
Kitty	1
you	1
may	1
cough	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
fatigued	1
with	1
the	1
raptures	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
What	1
an	1
excellent	1
father	1
you	1
have	1
girls	1
said	1
she	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
ever	1
make	1
him	1
amends	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
or	1
me	1
either	1
for	1
that	1
matter	1
At	1
our	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
pleasant	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
new	1
acquaintances	1
every	1
day	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
we	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
Lydia	1
my	1
love	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
youngest	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
will	1
dance	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
ball	1
Oh	1
said	1
Lydia	1
stoutly	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
youngest	1
I	1
m	1
the	1
tallest	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
conjecturing	1
how	1
soon	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
s	1
visit	1
and	1
determining	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner	1
Chapter	1
3	1
Not	1
all	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
however	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
her	1
five	1
daughters	1
could	1
ask	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
draw	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
description	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
They	1
attacked	1
him	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
with	1
barefaced	1
questions	1
ingenious	1
suppositions	1
and	1
distant	1
surmises	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
last	1
obliged	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
second	1
hand	1
intelligence	1
of	1
their	1
neighbour	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
Her	1
report	1
was	1
highly	1
favourable	1
Sir	1
William	1
had	1
been	1
delighted	1
with	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
young	1
wonderfully	1
handsome	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
and	1
to	1
crown	1
the	1
whole	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
assembly	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
delightful	1
To	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
dancing	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
step	1
towards	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
very	1
lively	1
hopes	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
heart	1
were	1
entertained	1
If	1
I	1
can	1
but	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
daughters	1
happily	1
settled	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
equally	1
well	1
married	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
returned	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
s	1
visit	1
and	1
sat	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
library	1
He	1
had	1
entertained	1
hopes	1
of	1
being	1
admitted	1
to	1
a	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
of	1
whose	1
beauty	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
father	1
The	1
ladies	1
were	1
somewhat	1
more	1
fortunate	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
ascertaining	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
window	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
blue	1
coat	1
and	1
rode	1
a	1
black	1
horse	1
An	1
invitation	1
to	1
dinner	1
was	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
dispatched	1
and	1
already	1
had	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
planned	1
the	1
courses	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
credit	1
to	1
her	1
housekeeping	1
when	1
an	1
answer	1
arrived	1
which	1
deferred	1
it	1
all	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
and	1
consequently	1
unable	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
their	1
invitation	1
etc	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
quite	1
disconcerted	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
business	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
in	1
town	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
always	1
flying	1
about	1
from	1
one	1
place	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
never	1
settled	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
quieted	1
her	1
fears	1
a	1
little	1
by	1
starting	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
gone	1
to	1
London	1
only	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
for	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
a	1
report	1
soon	1
followed	1
that	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
twelve	1
ladies	1
and	1
seven	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
assembly	1
The	1
girls	1
grieved	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
ladies	1
but	1
were	1
comforted	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
ball	1
by	1
hearing	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
twelve	1
he	1
brought	1
only	1
six	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
London	1
his	1
five	1
sisters	1
and	1
a	1
cousin	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
party	1
entered	1
the	1
assembly	1
room	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
only	1
five	1
altogether	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
and	1
another	1
young	1
man	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
was	1
good	1
looking	1
and	1
gentlemanlike	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
countenance	1
and	1
easy	1
unaffected	1
manners	1
His	1
sisters	1
were	1
fine	1
women	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
decided	1
fashion	1
His	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
merely	1
looked	1
the	1
gentleman	1
but	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
soon	1
drew	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
by	1
his	1
fine	1
tall	1
person	1
handsome	1
features	1
noble	1
mien	1
and	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
general	1
circulation	1
within	1
five	1
minutes	1
after	1
his	1
entrance	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
pronounced	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
the	1
ladies	1
declared	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
handsomer	1
than	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
looked	1
at	1
with	1
great	1
admiration	1
for	1
about	1
half	1
the	1
evening	1
till	1
his	1
manners	1
gave	1
a	1
disgust	1
which	1
turned	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
his	1
popularity	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
discovered	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
above	1
his	1
company	1
and	1
above	1
being	1
pleased	1
and	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
large	1
estate	1
in	1
Derbyshire	1
could	1
then	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
having	1
a	1
most	1
forbidding	1
disagreeable	1
countenance	1
and	1
being	1
unworthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
had	1
soon	1
made	1
himself	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
was	1
lively	1
and	1
unreserved	1
danced	1
every	1
dance	1
was	1
angry	1
that	1
the	1
ball	1
closed	1
so	1
early	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
giving	1
one	1
himself	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
Such	1
amiable	1
qualities	1
must	1
speak	1
for	1
themselves	1
What	1
a	1
contrast	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
danced	1
only	1
once	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
once	1
with	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
declined	1
being	1
introduced	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
lady	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
in	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
speaking	1
occasionally	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
party	1
His	1
character	1
was	1
decided	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
proudest	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
everybody	1
hoped	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
there	1
again	1
Amongst	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
against	1
him	1
was	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
whose	1
dislike	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
behaviour	1
was	1
sharpened	1
into	1
particular	1
resentment	1
by	1
his	1
having	1
slighted	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
by	1
the	1
scarcity	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
for	1
two	1
dances	1
and	1
during	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
conversation	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dance	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
press	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
join	1
it	1
Come	1
Darcy	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
you	1
dance	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
standing	1
about	1
by	1
yourself	1
in	1
this	1
stupid	1
manner	1
You	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
dance	1
I	1
certainly	1
shall	1
not	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
detest	1
it	1
unless	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
partner	1
At	1
such	1
an	1
assembly	1
as	1
this	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
insupportable	1
Your	1
sisters	1
are	1
engaged	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
another	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
whom	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
punishment	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
fastidious	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
cried	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
for	1
a	1
kingdom	1
Upon	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
pleasant	1
girls	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
evening	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
see	1
uncommonly	1
pretty	1
You	1
are	1
dancing	1
with	1
the	1
only	1
handsome	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
said	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
eldest	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
Oh	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
creature	1
I	1
ever	1
beheld	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
sitting	1
down	1
just	1
behind	1
you	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
very	1
agreeable	1
Do	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
my	1
partner	1
to	1
introduce	1
you	1
Which	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
Elizabeth	1
till	1
catching	1
her	1
eye	1
he	1
withdrew	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
coldly	1
said	1
She	1
is	1
tolerable	1
but	1
not	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
tempt	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
no	1
humour	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
give	1
consequence	1
to	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
are	1
slighted	1
by	1
other	1
men	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
partner	1
and	1
enjoy	1
her	1
smiles	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
time	1
with	1
me	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
followed	1
his	1
advice	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
walked	1
off	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
remained	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
cordial	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him	1
She	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
however	1
with	1
great	1
spirit	1
among	1
her	1
friends	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
lively	1
playful	1
disposition	1
which	1
delighted	1
in	1
anything	1
ridiculous	1
The	1
evening	1
altogether	1
passed	1
off	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
much	1
admired	1
by	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
party	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
sisters	1
Jane	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
this	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
be	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
quieter	1
way	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
Jane	1
s	1
pleasure	1
Mary	1
had	1
heard	1
herself	1
mentioned	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
accomplished	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
had	1
been	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
partners	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
yet	1
learnt	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
at	1
a	1
ball	1
They	1
returned	1
therefore	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
they	1
lived	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
principal	1
inhabitants	1
They	1
found	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
still	1
up	1
With	1
a	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
regardless	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
which	1
had	1
raised	1
such	1
splendid	1
expectations	1
He	1
had	1
rather	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
stranger	1
would	1
be	1
disappointed	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
different	1
story	1
to	1
hear	1
Oh	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
most	1
delightful	1
evening	1
a	1
most	1
excellent	1
ball	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
Jane	1
was	1
so	1
admired	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
like	1
it	1
Everybody	1
said	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
looked	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
thought	1
her	1
quite	1
beautiful	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
Only	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
he	1
actually	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
First	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
asked	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
vexed	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
But	1
however	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
admire	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
indeed	1
nobody	1
can	1
you	1
know	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
struck	1
with	1
Jane	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
down	1
the	1
dance	1
So	1
he	1
inquired	1
who	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
got	1
introduced	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
next	1
Then	1
the	1
two	1
third	1
he	1
danced	1
with	1
Miss	1
King	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fourth	1
with	1
Maria	1
Lucas	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fifth	1
with	1
Jane	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sixth	1
with	1
Lizzy	1
and	1
the	1
Boulanger	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
any	1
compassion	1
for	1
me	1
cried	1
her	1
husband	1
impatiently	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
danced	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
For	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
partners	1
Oh	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sprained	1
his	1
ankle	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
dance	1
Oh	1
my	1
dear	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
him	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
excessively	1
handsome	1
And	1
his	1
sisters	1
are	1
charming	1
women	1
I	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
anything	1
more	1
elegant	1
than	1
their	1
dresses	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
the	1
lace	1
upon	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
s	1
gown	1
Here	1
she	1
was	1
interrupted	1
again	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
protested	1
against	1
any	1
description	1
of	1
finery	1
She	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
seek	1
another	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
related	1
with	1
much	1
bitterness	1
of	1
spirit	1
and	1
some	1
exaggeration	1
the	1
shocking	1
rudeness	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
she	1
added	1
that	1
Lizzy	1
does	1
not	1
lose	1
much	1
by	1
not	1
suiting	1
his	1
fancy	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
horrid	1
man	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worth	1
pleasing	1
So	1
high	1
and	1
so	1
conceited	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
enduring	1
him	1
He	1
walked	1
here	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
there	1
fancying	1
himself	1
so	1
very	1
great	1
Not	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
my	1
dear	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
set	1
downs	1
I	1
quite	1
detest	1
the	1
man	1
Chapter	1
4	1
When	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
alone	1
the	1
former	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cautious	1
in	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
before	1
expressed	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
just	1
how	1
very	1
much	1
she	1
admired	1
him	1
He	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
she	1
sensible	1
good	1
humoured	1
lively	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
happy	1
manners	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
with	1
such	1
perfect	1
good	1
breeding	1
He	1
is	1
also	1
handsome	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
which	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
likewise	1
to	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
possibly	1
can	1
His	1
character	1
is	1
thereby	1
complete	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
dance	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
a	1
compliment	1
Did	1
not	1
you	1
I	1
did	1
for	1
you	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
one	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
Compliments	1
always	1
take	1
you	1
by	1
surprise	1
and	1
me	1
never	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
his	1
asking	1
you	1
again	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
times	1
as	1
pretty	1
as	1
every	1
other	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
No	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
gallantry	1
for	1
that	1
Well	1
he	1
certainly	1
is	1
very	1
agreeable	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
leave	1
to	1
like	1
him	1
You	1
have	1
liked	1
many	1
a	1
stupider	1
person	1
Dear	1
Lizzy	1
Oh	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
apt	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
like	1
people	1
in	1
general	1
You	1
never	1
see	1
a	1
fault	1
in	1
anybody	1
All	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
agreeable	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
you	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
in	1
your	1
life	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
hasty	1
in	1
censuring	1
anyone	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
speak	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
do	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
wonder	1
With	1
your	1
good	1
sense	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
honestly	1
blind	1
to	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
nonsense	1
of	1
others	1
Affectation	1
of	1
candour	1
is	1
common	1
enough	1
one	1
meets	1
with	1
it	1
everywhere	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
candid	1
without	1
ostentation	1
or	1
design	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
everybody	1
s	1
character	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
still	1
better	1
and	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
bad	1
belongs	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
like	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
sisters	1
too	1
do	1
you	1
Their	1
manners	1
are	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
his	1
Certainly	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
But	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
pleasing	1
women	1
when	1
you	1
converse	1
with	1
them	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
very	1
charming	1
neighbour	1
in	1
her	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
convinced	1
their	1
behaviour	1
at	1
the	1
assembly	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
calculated	1
to	1
please	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
quickness	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
less	1
pliancy	1
of	1
temper	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
judgement	1
too	1
unassailed	1
by	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
disposed	1
to	1
approve	1
them	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
fact	1
very	1
fine	1
ladies	1
not	1
deficient	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
pleased	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
themselves	1
agreeable	1
when	1
they	1
chose	1
it	1
but	1
proud	1
and	1
conceited	1
They	1
were	1
rather	1
handsome	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
private	1
seminaries	1
in	1
town	1
had	1
a	1
fortune	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
spending	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
ought	1
and	1
of	1
associating	1
with	1
people	1
of	1
rank	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
entitled	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
themselves	1
and	1
meanly	1
of	1
others	1
They	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
respectable	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
England	1
a	1
circumstance	1
more	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
on	1
their	1
memories	1
than	1
that	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
fortune	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
had	1
been	1
acquired	1
by	1
trade	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
inherited	1
property	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
who	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
purchase	1
an	1
estate	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
intended	1
it	1
likewise	1
and	1
sometimes	1
made	1
choice	1
of	1
his	1
county	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
provided	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
a	1
manor	1
it	1
was	1
doubtful	1
to	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
best	1
knew	1
the	1
easiness	1
of	1
his	1
temper	1
whether	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
next	1
generation	1
to	1
purchase	1
His	1
sisters	1
were	1
anxious	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
an	1
estate	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
tenant	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unwilling	1
to	1
preside	1
at	1
his	1
table	1
nor	1
was	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
who	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
more	1
fashion	1
than	1
fortune	1
less	1
disposed	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
house	1
as	1
her	1
home	1
when	1
it	1
suited	1
her	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
age	1
two	1
years	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tempted	1
by	1
an	1
accidental	1
recommendation	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
House	1
He	1
did	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
into	1
it	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
was	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
situation	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
rooms	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
owner	1
said	1
in	1
its	1
praise	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
immediately	1
Between	1
him	1
and	1
Darcy	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
steady	1
friendship	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
great	1
opposition	1
of	1
character	1
Bingley	1
was	1
endeared	1
to	1
Darcy	1
by	1
the	1
easiness	1
openness	1
and	1
ductility	1
of	1
his	1
temper	1
though	1
no	1
disposition	1
could	1
offer	1
a	1
greater	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
though	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
never	1
appeared	1
dissatisfied	1
On	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Darcy	1
s	1
regard	1
Bingley	1
had	1
the	1
firmest	1
reliance	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
judgement	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
In	1
understanding	1
Darcy	1
was	1
the	1
superior	1
Bingley	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
deficient	1
but	1
Darcy	1
was	1
clever	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
haughty	1
reserved	1
and	1
fastidious	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
though	1
well	1
bred	1
were	1
not	1
inviting	1
In	1
that	1
respect	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
greatly	1
the	1
advantage	1
Bingley	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
liked	1
wherever	1
he	1
appeared	1
Darcy	1
was	1
continually	1
giving	1
offense	1
The	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
Meryton	1
assembly	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
characteristic	1
Bingley	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
more	1
pleasant	1
people	1
or	1
prettier	1
girls	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
everybody	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
kind	1
and	1
attentive	1
to	1
him	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
formality	1
no	1
stiffness	1
he	1
had	1
soon	1
felt	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
an	1
angel	1
more	1
beautiful	1
Darcy	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
whom	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
beauty	1
and	1
no	1
fashion	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
smallest	1
interest	1
and	1
from	1
none	1
received	1
either	1
attention	1
or	1
pleasure	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
he	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
be	1
pretty	1
but	1
she	1
smiled	1
too	1
much	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
but	1
still	1
they	1
admired	1
her	1
and	1
liked	1
her	1
and	1
pronounced	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sweet	1
girl	1
and	1
one	1
whom	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
therefore	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
sweet	1
girl	1
and	1
their	1
brother	1
felt	1
authorized	1
by	1
such	1
commendation	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
chose	1
Chapter	1
5	1
Within	1
a	1
short	1
walk	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
lived	1
a	1
family	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
Bennets	1
were	1
particularly	1
intimate	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
had	1
been	1
formerly	1
in	1
trade	1
in	1
Meryton	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
tolerable	1
fortune	1
and	1
risen	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
knighthood	1
by	1
an	1
address	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
during	1
his	1
mayoralty	1
The	1
distinction	1
had	1
perhaps	1
been	1
felt	1
too	1
strongly	1
It	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
disgust	1
to	1
his	1
business	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
residence	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
market	1
town	1
and	1
in	1
quitting	1
them	1
both	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
a	1
house	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Meryton	1
denominated	1
from	1
that	1
period	1
Lucas	1
Lodge	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
importance	1
and	1
unshackled	1
by	1
business	1
occupy	1
himself	1
solely	1
in	1
being	1
civil	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
For	1
though	1
elated	1
by	1
his	1
rank	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
render	1
him	1
supercilious	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
attention	1
to	1
everybody	1
By	1
nature	1
inoffensive	1
friendly	1
and	1
obliging	1
his	1
presentation	1
at	1
St	1
James	1
s	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
courteous	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
woman	1
not	1
too	1
clever	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
valuable	1
neighbour	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
They	1
had	1
several	1
children	1
The	1
eldest	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
sensible	1
intelligent	1
young	1
woman	1
about	1
twenty	1
seven	1
was	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
intimate	1
friend	1
That	1
the	1
Miss	1
Lucases	1
and	1
the	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
should	1
meet	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
a	1
ball	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
assembly	1
brought	1
the	1
former	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
to	1
communicate	1
You	1
began	1
the	1
evening	1
well	1
Charlotte	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
with	1
civil	1
self	1
command	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
You	1
were	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
first	1
choice	1
Yes	1
but	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
like	1
his	1
second	1
better	1
Oh	1
you	1
mean	1
Jane	1
I	1
suppose	1
because	1
he	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
did	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
admired	1
her	1
indeed	1
I	1
rather	1
believe	1
he	1
did	1
I	1
heard	1
something	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
what	1
something	1
about	1
Mr	1
Robinson	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
I	1
overheard	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Mr	1
Robinson	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
Mr	1
Robinson	1
s	1
asking	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
our	1
Meryton	1
assemblies	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
pretty	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
prettiest	1
and	1
his	1
answering	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
question	1
Oh	1
the	1
eldest	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
two	1
opinions	1
on	1
that	1
point	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
Well	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
decided	1
indeed	1
that	1
does	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
but	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
nothing	1
you	1
know	1
My	1
overhearings	1
were	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
than	1
yours	1
Eliza	1
said	1
Charlotte	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
worth	1
listening	1
to	1
as	1
his	1
friend	1
is	1
he	1
poor	1
Eliza	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
just	1
tolerable	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
Lizzy	1
s	1
head	1
to	1
be	1
vexed	1
by	1
his	1
ill	1
treatment	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
man	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
misfortune	1
to	1
be	1
liked	1
by	1
him	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
told	1
me	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
without	1
once	1
opening	1
his	1
lips	1
Are	1
you	1
quite	1
sure	1
ma	1
am	1
is	1
not	1
there	1
a	1
little	1
mistake	1
said	1
Jane	1
I	1
certainly	1
saw	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
Aye	1
because	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
at	1
last	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
answering	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
angry	1
at	1
being	1
spoke	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
told	1
me	1
said	1
Jane	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
speaks	1
much	1
unless	1
among	1
his	1
intimate	1
acquaintances	1
With	1
them	1
he	1
is	1
remarkably	1
agreeable	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
my	1
dear	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
very	1
agreeable	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
talked	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
guess	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
everybody	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
eat	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
somehow	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
does	1
not	1
keep	1
a	1
carriage	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
a	1
hack	1
chaise	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mind	1
his	1
not	1
talking	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Long	1
said	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
but	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
Eliza	1
Another	1
time	1
Lizzy	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you	1
I	1
believe	1
ma	1
am	1
I	1
may	1
safely	1
promise	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
His	1
pride	1
said	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
does	1
not	1
offend	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
pride	1
often	1
does	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
it	1
One	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
that	1
so	1
very	1
fine	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
family	1
fortune	1
everything	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
should	1
think	1
highly	1
of	1
himself	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
express	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
proud	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
true	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
forgive	1
his	1
pride	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
mortified	1
mine	1
Pride	1
observed	1
Mary	1
who	1
piqued	1
herself	1
upon	1
the	1
solidity	1
of	1
her	1
reflections	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
common	1
failing	1
I	1
believe	1
By	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
read	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
common	1
indeed	1
that	1
human	1
nature	1
is	1
particularly	1
prone	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
cherish	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
self	1
complacency	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
some	1
quality	1
or	1
other	1
real	1
or	1
imaginary	1
Vanity	1
and	1
pride	1
are	1
different	1
things	1
though	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
often	1
used	1
synonymously	1
A	1
person	1
may	1
be	1
proud	1
without	1
being	1
vain	1
Pride	1
relates	1
more	1
to	1
our	1
opinion	1
of	1
ourselves	1
vanity	1
to	1
what	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
others	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
cried	1
a	1
young	1
Lucas	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
sisters	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
care	1
how	1
proud	1
I	1
was	1
I	1
would	1
keep	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
foxhounds	1
and	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
a	1
day	1
Then	1
you	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
ought	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
your	1
bottle	1
directly	1
The	1
boy	1
protested	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
and	1
the	1
argument	1
ended	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
visit	1
Chapter	1
6	1
The	1
ladies	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
soon	1
waited	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
Netherfield	1
The	1
visit	1
was	1
soon	1
returned	1
in	1
due	1
form	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
s	1
pleasing	1
manners	1
grew	1
on	1
the	1
goodwill	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
intolerable	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
sisters	1
not	1
worth	1
speaking	1
to	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
being	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them	1
was	1
expressed	1
towards	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
By	1
Jane	1
this	1
attention	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
still	1
saw	1
superciliousness	1
in	1
their	1
treatment	1
of	1
everybody	1
hardly	1
excepting	1
even	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
like	1
them	1
though	1
their	1
kindness	1
to	1
Jane	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
as	1
arising	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
admiration	1
It	1
was	1
generally	1
evident	1
whenever	1
they	1
met	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
admire	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
equally	1
evident	1
that	1
Jane	1
was	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
preference	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
entertain	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
but	1
she	1
considered	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general	1
since	1
Jane	1
united	1
with	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
feeling	1
a	1
composure	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
a	1
uniform	1
cheerfulness	1
of	1
manner	1
which	1
would	1
guard	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
suspicions	1
of	1
the	1
impertinent	1
She	1
mentioned	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
pleasant	1
replied	1
Charlotte	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
public	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
a	1
disadvantage	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
guarded	1
If	1
a	1
woman	1
conceals	1
her	1
affection	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
skill	1
from	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
may	1
lose	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
fixing	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
but	1
poor	1
consolation	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
world	1
equally	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
There	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
gratitude	1
or	1
vanity	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
attachment	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
safe	1
to	1
leave	1
any	1
to	1
itself	1
We	1
can	1
all	1
begin	1
freely	1
a	1
slight	1
preference	1
is	1
natural	1
enough	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
heart	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
really	1
in	1
love	1
without	1
encouragement	1
In	1
nine	1
cases	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
a	1
woman	1
had	1
better	1
show	1
more	1
affection	1
than	1
she	1
feels	1
Bingley	1
likes	1
your	1
sister	1
undoubtedly	1
but	1
he	1
may	1
never	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
like	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
help	1
him	1
on	1
But	1
she	1
does	1
help	1
him	1
on	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
her	1
nature	1
will	1
allow	1
If	1
I	1
can	1
perceive	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
simpleton	1
indeed	1
not	1
to	1
discover	1
it	1
too	1
Remember	1
Eliza	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
Jane	1
s	1
disposition	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
partial	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
endeavour	1
to	1
conceal	1
it	1
he	1
must	1
find	1
it	1
out	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
must	1
if	1
he	1
sees	1
enough	1
of	1
her	1
But	1
though	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
meet	1
tolerably	1
often	1
it	1
is	1
never	1
for	1
many	1
hours	1
together	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
large	1
mixed	1
parties	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
every	1
moment	1
should	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
conversing	1
together	1
Jane	1
should	1
therefore	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
every	1
half	1
hour	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
can	1
command	1
his	1
attention	1
When	1
she	1
is	1
secure	1
of	1
him	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
leisure	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
chooses	1
Your	1
plan	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
where	1
nothing	1
is	1
in	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
being	1
well	1
married	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
rich	1
husband	1
or	1
any	1
husband	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
should	1
adopt	1
it	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
Jane	1
s	1
feelings	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
acting	1
by	1
design	1
As	1
yet	1
she	1
cannot	1
even	1
be	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
regard	1
nor	1
of	1
its	1
reasonableness	1
She	1
has	1
known	1
him	1
only	1
a	1
fortnight	1
She	1
danced	1
four	1
dances	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Meryton	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
one	1
morning	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
company	1
four	1
times	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
understand	1
his	1
character	1
Not	1
as	1
you	1
represent	1
it	1
Had	1
she	1
merely	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
she	1
might	1
only	1
have	1
discovered	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
appetite	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
four	1
evenings	1
have	1
also	1
been	1
spent	1
together	1
and	1
four	1
evenings	1
may	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
Yes	1
these	1
four	1
evenings	1
have	1
enabled	1
them	1
to	1
ascertain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
like	1
Vingt	1
un	1
better	1
than	1
Commerce	1
but	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
leading	1
characteristic	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
unfolded	1
Well	1
said	1
Charlotte	1
I	1
wish	1
Jane	1
success	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
married	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
she	1
had	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
studying	1
his	1
character	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
Happiness	1
in	1
marriage	1
is	1
entirely	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
chance	1
If	1
the	1
dispositions	1
of	1
the	1
parties	1
are	1
ever	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
or	1
ever	1
so	1
similar	1
beforehand	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
advance	1
their	1
felicity	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
They	1
always	1
continue	1
to	1
grow	1
sufficiently	1
unlike	1
afterwards	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
of	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
with	1
whom	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
pass	1
your	1
life	1
You	1
make	1
me	1
laugh	1
Charlotte	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sound	1
You	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sound	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
act	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
yourself	1
Occupied	1
in	1
observing	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
attentions	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
suspecting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
becoming	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
scarcely	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
pretty	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
next	1
met	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
only	1
to	1
criticise	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
that	1
she	1
hardly	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
feature	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
than	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
was	1
rendered	1
uncommonly	1
intelligent	1
by	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
To	1
this	1
discovery	1
succeeded	1
some	1
others	1
equally	1
mortifying	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
detected	1
with	1
a	1
critical	1
eye	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
failure	1
of	1
perfect	1
symmetry	1
in	1
her	1
form	1
he	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
her	1
figure	1
to	1
be	1
light	1
and	1
pleasing	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
asserting	1
that	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
their	1
easy	1
playfulness	1
Of	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unaware	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
made	1
himself	1
agreeable	1
nowhere	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
her	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
step	1
towards	1
conversing	1
with	1
her	1
himself	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
others	1
His	1
doing	1
so	1
drew	1
her	1
notice	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
s	1
where	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
were	1
assembled	1
What	1
does	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
mean	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
by	1
listening	1
to	1
my	1
conversation	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
only	1
can	1
answer	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
it	1
any	1
more	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
satirical	1
eye	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
begin	1
by	1
being	1
impertinent	1
myself	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
grow	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
On	1
his	1
approaching	1
them	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
though	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
speaking	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
defied	1
her	1
friend	1
to	1
mention	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
immediately	1
provoking	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
that	1
I	1
expressed	1
myself	1
uncommonly	1
well	1
just	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
teasing	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
Meryton	1
With	1
great	1
energy	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
makes	1
a	1
lady	1
energetic	1
You	1
are	1
severe	1
on	1
us	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
her	1
turn	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
teased	1
said	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
instrument	1
Eliza	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
follows	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
creature	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
always	1
wanting	1
me	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
before	1
anybody	1
and	1
everybody	1
If	1
my	1
vanity	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
musical	1
turn	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
invaluable	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
would	1
really	1
rather	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
before	1
those	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
performers	1
On	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
s	1
persevering	1
however	1
she	1
added	1
Very	1
well	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
And	1
gravely	1
glancing	1
at	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
old	1
saying	1
which	1
everybody	1
here	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
familiar	1
with	1
Keep	1
your	1
breath	1
to	1
cool	1
your	1
porridge	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
mine	1
to	1
swell	1
my	1
song	1
Her	1
performance	1
was	1
pleasing	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
capital	1
After	1
a	1
song	1
or	1
two	1
and	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
several	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
sing	1
again	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
succeeded	1
at	1
the	1
instrument	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
Mary	1
who	1
having	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
only	1
plain	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
worked	1
hard	1
for	1
knowledge	1
and	1
accomplishments	1
was	1
always	1
impatient	1
for	1
display	1
Mary	1
had	1
neither	1
genius	1
nor	1
taste	1
and	1
though	1
vanity	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
application	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
likewise	1
a	1
pedantic	1
air	1
and	1
conceited	1
manner	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
injured	1
a	1
higher	1
degree	1
of	1
excellence	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
Elizabeth	1
easy	1
and	1
unaffected	1
had	1
been	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
much	1
more	1
pleasure	1
though	1
not	1
playing	1
half	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
Mary	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
concerto	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
purchase	1
praise	1
and	1
gratitude	1
by	1
Scotch	1
and	1
Irish	1
airs	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
her	1
younger	1
sisters	1
who	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Lucases	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
officers	1
joined	1
eagerly	1
in	1
dancing	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
in	1
silent	1
indignation	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
mode	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
evening	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
all	1
conversation	1
and	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
engrossed	1
by	1
his	1
thoughts	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
was	1
his	1
neighbour	1
till	1
Sir	1
William	1
thus	1
began	1
What	1
a	1
charming	1
amusement	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
this	1
is	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
like	1
dancing	1
after	1
all	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
refinements	1
of	1
polished	1
society	1
Certainly	1
sir	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
advantage	1
also	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
vogue	1
amongst	1
the	1
less	1
polished	1
societies	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Every	1
savage	1
can	1
dance	1
Sir	1
William	1
only	1
smiled	1
Your	1
friend	1
performs	1
delightfully	1
he	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
on	1
seeing	1
Bingley	1
join	1
the	1
group	1
and	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
adept	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
yourself	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
You	1
saw	1
me	1
dance	1
at	1
Meryton	1
I	1
believe	1
sir	1
Yes	1
indeed	1
and	1
received	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
Do	1
you	1
often	1
dance	1
at	1
St	1
James	1
s	1
Never	1
sir	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
proper	1
compliment	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
compliment	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
pay	1
to	1
any	1
place	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
avoid	1
it	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
town	1
I	1
conclude	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
bowed	1
I	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
some	1
thought	1
of	1
fixing	1
in	1
town	1
myself	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
superior	1
society	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
London	1
would	1
agree	1
with	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
He	1
paused	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
an	1
answer	1
but	1
his	1
companion	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
moving	1
towards	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
very	1
gallant	1
thing	1
and	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
My	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
dancing	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
you	1
must	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
this	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
partner	1
You	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
to	1
dance	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
when	1
so	1
much	1
beauty	1
is	1
before	1
you	1
And	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
who	1
though	1
extremely	1
surprised	1
was	1
not	1
unwilling	1
to	1
receive	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
instantly	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
some	1
discomposure	1
to	1
Sir	1
William	1
Indeed	1
sir	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
intention	1
of	1
dancing	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
moved	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
beg	1
for	1
a	1
partner	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
with	1
grave	1
propriety	1
requested	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
determined	1
nor	1
did	1
Sir	1
William	1
at	1
all	1
shake	1
her	1
purpose	1
by	1
his	1
attempt	1
at	1
persuasion	1
You	1
excel	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
dance	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
cruel	1
to	1
deny	1
me	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
gentleman	1
dislikes	1
the	1
amusement	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
to	1
oblige	1
us	1
for	1
one	1
half	1
hour	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
all	1
politeness	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
smiling	1
He	1
is	1
indeed	1
but	1
considering	1
the	1
inducement	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
we	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at	1
his	1
complaisance	1
for	1
who	1
would	1
object	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
partner	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
archly	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
Her	1
resistance	1
had	1
not	1
injured	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
gentleman	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
some	1
complacency	1
when	1
thus	1
accosted	1
by	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
I	1
can	1
guess	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
your	1
reverie	1
I	1
should	1
imagine	1
not	1
You	1
are	1
considering	1
how	1
insupportable	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
pass	1
many	1
evenings	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
such	1
society	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
annoyed	1
The	1
insipidity	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
noise	1
the	1
nothingness	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
self	1
importance	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
people	1
What	1
would	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
strictures	1
on	1
them	1
Your	1
conjecture	1
is	1
totally	1
wrong	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
My	1
mind	1
was	1
more	1
agreeably	1
engaged	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
meditating	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
pleasure	1
which	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
fine	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
can	1
bestow	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
immediately	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
desired	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
lady	1
had	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
inspiring	1
such	1
reflections	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
replied	1
with	1
great	1
intrepidity	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
repeated	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
astonishment	1
How	1
long	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
favourite	1
and	1
pray	1
when	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
wish	1
you	1
joy	1
That	1
is	1
exactly	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
I	1
expected	1
you	1
to	1
ask	1
A	1
lady	1
s	1
imagination	1
is	1
very	1
rapid	1
it	1
jumps	1
from	1
admiration	1
to	1
love	1
from	1
love	1
to	1
matrimony	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
wishing	1
me	1
joy	1
Nay	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
serious	1
about	1
it	1
I	1
shall	1
consider	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
absolutely	1
settled	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
charming	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
indeed	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
with	1
you	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
while	1
she	1
chose	1
to	1
entertain	1
herself	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
composure	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
safe	1
her	1
wit	1
flowed	1
long	1

Bennet	1
s	1
property	1
consisted	1
almost	1
entirely	1
in	1
an	1
estate	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
which	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
his	1
daughters	1
was	1
entailed	1
in	1
default	1
of	1
heirs	1
male	1
on	1
a	1
distant	1
relation	1
and	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
fortune	1
though	1
ample	1
for	1
her	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
could	1
but	1
ill	1
supply	1
the	1
deficiency	1
of	1
his	1
Her	1
father	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
attorney	1
in	1
Meryton	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
four	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
sister	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
Mr	1
Phillips	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
clerk	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
succeeded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
and	1
a	1
brother	1
settled	1
in	1
London	1
in	1
a	1
respectable	1
line	1
of	1
trade	1
The	1
village	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
mile	1
from	1
Meryton	1
a	1
most	1
convenient	1
distance	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
were	1
usually	1
tempted	1
thither	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
pay	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
their	1
aunt	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
milliner	1
s	1
shop	1
just	1
over	1
the	1
way	1
The	1
two	1
youngest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
were	1
particularly	1
frequent	1
in	1
these	1
attentions	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
more	1
vacant	1
than	1
their	1
sisters	1
and	1
when	1
nothing	1
better	1
offered	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
amuse	1
their	1
morning	1
hours	1
and	1
furnish	1
conversation	1
for	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
however	1
bare	1
of	1
news	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
general	1
might	1
be	1
they	1
always	1
contrived	1
to	1
learn	1
some	1
from	1
their	1
aunt	1
At	1
present	1
indeed	1
they	1
were	1
well	1
supplied	1
both	1
with	1
news	1
and	1
happiness	1
by	1
the	1
recent	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
militia	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
remain	1
the	1
whole	1
winter	1
and	1
Meryton	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters	1
Their	1
visits	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
were	1
now	1
productive	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
intelligence	1
Every	1
day	1
added	1
something	1
to	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
names	1
and	1
connections	1
Their	1
lodgings	1
were	1
not	1
long	1
a	1
secret	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
officers	1
themselves	1
Mr	1
Phillips	1
visited	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
this	1
opened	1
to	1
his	1
nieces	1
a	1
store	1
of	1
felicity	1
unknown	1
before	1
They	1
could	1
talk	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
officers	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
large	1
fortune	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
which	1
gave	1
animation	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
worthless	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
when	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
regimentals	1
of	1
an	1
ensign	1
After	1
listening	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
their	1
effusions	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
coolly	1
observed	1
From	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
collect	1
by	1
your	1
manner	1
of	1
talking	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
silliest	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
I	1
have	1
suspected	1
it	1
some	1
time	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
convinced	1
Catherine	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
Lydia	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
continued	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
admiration	1
of	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
and	1
her	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
London	1
I	1
am	1
astonished	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
think	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
silly	1
If	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
think	1
slightingly	1
of	1
anybody	1
s	1
children	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
however	1
If	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
silly	1
I	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
sensible	1
of	1
it	1
Yes	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
happens	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
very	1
clever	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
point	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
on	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
agree	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
our	1
sentiments	1
coincided	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
so	1
far	1
differ	1
from	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
two	1
youngest	1
daughters	1
uncommonly	1
foolish	1
My	1
dear	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
girls	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
When	1
they	1
get	1
to	1
our	1
age	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
officers	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
do	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
liked	1
a	1
red	1
coat	1
myself	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
indeed	1
so	1
I	1
do	1
still	1
at	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
smart	1
young	1
colonel	1
with	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
should	1
want	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
girls	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
nay	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
looked	1
very	1
becoming	1
the	1
other	1
night	1
at	1
Sir	1
William	1
s	1
in	1
his	1
regimentals	1
Mamma	1
cried	1
Lydia	1
my	1
aunt	1
says	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
and	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
often	1
to	1
Miss	1
Watson	1
s	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
came	1
she	1
sees	1
them	1
now	1
very	1
often	1
standing	1
in	1
Clarke	1
s	1
library	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
prevented	1
replying	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
for	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
waited	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
calling	1
out	1
while	1
her	1
daughter	1
read	1
Well	1
Jane	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
from	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
about	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
say	1
Well	1
Jane	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
make	1
haste	1
my	1
love	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
said	1
Jane	1
and	1
then	1
read	1
it	1
aloud	1
MY	1
DEAR	1
FRIEND	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
compassionate	1
as	1
to	1
dine	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
Louisa	1
and	1
me	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
hating	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
s	1
t^ete	1
`a	1
t^ete	1
between	1
two	1
women	1

never	1
end	1
without	1

quarrel	1
Come	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
on	1
receipt	1
of	1
this	1
My	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
Yours	1
ever	1
CAROLINE	1
BINGLEY	1
With	1
the	1
officers	1
cried	1
Lydia	1
I	1
wonder	1
my	1
aunt	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
that	1
Dining	1
out	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
unlucky	1
Can	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
said	1
Jane	1
No	1
my	1
dear	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
on	1
horseback	1
because	1
it	1
seems	1
likely	1
to	1
rain	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
stay	1
all	1
night	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
scheme	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
offer	1
to	1
send	1
her	1
home	1
Oh	1
but	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
will	1
have	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
chaise	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Meryton	1
and	1
the	1
Hursts	1
have	1
no	1
horses	1
to	1
theirs	1
I	1
had	1
much	1
rather	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
your	1
father	1
cannot	1
spare	1
the	1
horses	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
They	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
They	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
much	1
oftener	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
them	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
them	1
to	1
day	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
my	1
mother	1
s	1
purpose	1
will	1
be	1
answered	1
She	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
extort	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
an	1
acknowledgment	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
engaged	1
Jane	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
attended	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
many	1
cheerful	1
prognostics	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
day	1
Her	1
hopes	1
were	1
answered	1
Jane	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
gone	1
long	1
before	1
it	1
rained	1
hard	1
Her	1
sisters	1
were	1
uneasy	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
delighted	1
The	1
rain	1
continued	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
without	1
intermission	1
Jane	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
lucky	1
idea	1
of	1
mine	1
indeed	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
making	1
it	1
rain	1
were	1
all	1
her	1
own	1
Till	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
however	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
felicity	1
of	1
her	1
contrivance	1
Breakfast	1
was	1
scarcely	1
over	1
when	1
a	1
servant	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
brought	1
the	1
following	1
note	1
for	1
Elizabeth	1
MY	1
DEAREST	1
LIZZY	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
very	1
unwell	1
this	1
morning	1
which	1
I	1
suppose	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
imputed	1
to	1
my	1
getting	1
wet	1
through	1
yesterday	1
My	1
kind	1
friends	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
my	1
returning	1
till	1
I	1
am	1
better	1
They	1
insist	1
also	1
on	1
my	1
seeing	1
Mr	1
Jones	1
therefore	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
excepting	1
a	1
sore	1
throat	1
and	1
headache	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
Yours	1
etc	1
Well	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
note	1
aloud	1
if	1
your	1
daughter	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
dangerous	1
fit	1
of	1
illness	1
if	1
she	1
should	1
die	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
under	1
your	1
orders	1
Oh	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
dying	1
People	1
do	1
not	1
die	1
of	1
little	1
trifling	1
colds	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
good	1
care	1
of	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
stays	1
there	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
Elizabeth	1
feeling	1
really	1
anxious	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
though	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
horsewoman	1
walking	1
was	1
her	1
only	1
alternative	1
She	1
declared	1
her	1
resolution	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
silly	1
cried	1
her	1
mother	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
dirt	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
fit	1
to	1
see	1
Jane	1
which	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
Is	1
this	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
me	1
Lizzy	1
said	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
No	1
indeed	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
walk	1
The	1
distance	1
is	1
nothing	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
a	1
motive	1
only	1
three	1
miles	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
back	1
by	1
dinner	1
I	1
admire	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
your	1
benevolence	1
observed	1
Mary	1
but	1
every	1
impulse	1
of	1
feeling	1
should	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
reason	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
exertion	1
should	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
required	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Meryton	1
with	1
you	1
said	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
Elizabeth	1
accepted	1
their	1
company	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
set	1
off	1
together	1
If	1
we	1
make	1
haste	1
said	1
Lydia	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
along	1
perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
something	1
of	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
before	1
he	1
goes	1
In	1
Meryton	1
they	1
parted	1
the	1
two	1
youngest	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
lodgings	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
wives	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
continued	1
her	1
walk	1
alone	1
crossing	1
field	1
after	1
field	1
at	1
a	1
quick	1
pace	1
jumping	1
over	1
stiles	1
and	1
springing	1
over	1
puddles	1
with	1
impatient	1
activity	1
and	1
finding	1
herself	1
at	1
last	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
weary	1
ankles	1
dirty	1
stockings	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
glowing	1
with	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
exercise	1
She	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
where	1
all	1
but	1
Jane	1
were	1
assembled	1
and	1
where	1
her	1
appearance	1
created	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
surprise	1
That	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
walked	1
three	1
miles	1
so	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
such	1
dirty	1
weather	1
and	1
by	1
herself	1
was	1
almost	1
incredible	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
held	1
her	1
in	1
contempt	1
for	1
it	1
She	1
was	1
received	1
however	1
very	1
politely	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
manners	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
better	1
than	1
politeness	1
there	1
was	1
good	1
humour	1
and	1
kindness	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
said	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
The	1
former	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
which	1
exercise	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
complexion	1
and	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
occasion	1
s	1
justifying	1
her	1
coming	1
so	1
far	1
alone	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
breakfast	1
Her	1
inquiries	1
after	1
her	1
sister	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
favourably	1
answered	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
had	1
slept	1
ill	1
and	1
though	1
up	1
was	1
very	1
feverish	1
and	1
not	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
room	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
her	1
immediately	1
and	1
Jane	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
withheld	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
giving	1
alarm	1
or	1
inconvenience	1
from	1
expressing	1
in	1
her	1
note	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
longed	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
visit	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
her	1
entrance	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
equal	1
however	1
to	1
much	1
conversation	1
and	1
when	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
left	1
them	1
together	1
could	1
attempt	1
little	1
besides	1
expressions	1
of	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
kindness	1
she	1
was	1
treated	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
silently	1
attended	1
her	1
When	1
breakfast	1
was	1
over	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
the	1
sisters	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
like	1
them	1
herself	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
affection	1
and	1
solicitude	1
they	1
showed	1
for	1
Jane	1
The	1
apothecary	1
came	1
and	1
having	1
examined	1
his	1
patient	1
said	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
violent	1
cold	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
endeavour	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
it	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
promised	1
her	1
some	1
draughts	1
The	1
advice	1
was	1
followed	1
readily	1
for	1
the	1
feverish	1
symptoms	1
increased	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
ached	1
acutely	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
quit	1
her	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
nor	1
were	1
the	1
other	1
ladies	1
often	1
absent	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
being	1
out	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
elsewhere	1
When	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
three	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
go	1
and	1
very	1
unwillingly	1
said	1
so	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
offered	1
her	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
she	1
only	1
wanted	1
a	1
little	1
pressing	1
to	1
accept	1
it	1
when	1
Jane	1
testified	1
such	1
concern	1
in	1
parting	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
convert	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
to	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
Elizabeth	1
most	1
thankfully	1
consented	1
and	1
a	1
servant	1
was	1
dispatched	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
to	1
acquaint	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
her	1
stay	1
and	1
bring	1
back	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
clothes	1
Chapter	1
8	1
At	1
five	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
retired	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
at	1
half	1
past	1
six	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
dinner	1
To	1
the	1
civil	1
inquiries	1
which	1
then	1
poured	1
in	1
and	1
amongst	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
much	1
superior	1
solicitude	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
favourable	1
answer	1
Jane	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
better	1
The	1
sisters	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
repeated	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
were	1
grieved	1
how	1
shocking	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
cold	1
and	1
how	1
excessively	1
they	1
disliked	1
being	1
ill	1
themselves	1
and	1
then	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
their	1
indifference	1
towards	1
Jane	1
when	1
not	1
immediately	1
before	1
them	1
restored	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
dislike	1
Their	1
brother	1
indeed	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
regard	1
with	1
any	1
complacency	1
His	1
anxiety	1
for	1
Jane	1
was	1
evident	1
and	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
herself	1
most	1
pleasing	1
and	1
they	1
prevented	1
her	1
feeling	1
herself	1
so	1
much	1
an	1
intruder	1
as	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
others	1
She	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
notice	1
from	1
any	1
but	1
him	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
her	1
sister	1
scarcely	1
less	1
so	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
by	1
whom	1
Elizabeth	1
sat	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
indolent	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
only	1
to	1
eat	1
drink	1
and	1
play	1
at	1
cards	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
plain	1
dish	1
to	1
a	1
ragout	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
When	1
dinner	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
returned	1
directly	1
to	1
Jane	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
began	1
abusing	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Her	1
manners	1
were	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
bad	1
indeed	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
impertinence	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
conversation	1
no	1
style	1
no	1
beauty	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
thought	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
added	1
She	1
has	1
nothing	1
in	1
short	1
to	1
recommend	1
her	1
but	1
being	1
an	1
excellent	1
walker	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
her	1
appearance	1
this	1
morning	1
She	1
really	1
looked	1
almost	1
wild	1
She	1
did	1
indeed	1
Louisa	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
my	1
countenance	1
Very	1
nonsensical	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
all	1
Why	1
must	1
she	1
be	1
scampering	1
about	1
the	1
country	1
because	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
a	1
cold	1
Her	1
hair	1
so	1
untidy	1
so	1
blowsy	1
Yes	1
and	1
her	1
petticoat	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
saw	1
her	1
petticoat	1
six	1
inches	1
deep	1
in	1
mud	1
I	1
am	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
and	1
the	1
gown	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
doing	1
its	1
office	1
Your	1
picture	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
exact	1
Louisa	1
said	1
Bingley	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
lost	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
thought	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
looked	1
remarkably	1
well	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
this	1
morning	1
Her	1
dirty	1
petticoat	1
quite	1
escaped	1
my	1
notice	1
You	1
observed	1
it	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
sister	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
exhibition	1
Certainly	1
not	1
To	1
walk	1
three	1
miles	1
or	1
four	1
miles	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is	1
above	1
her	1
ankles	1
in	1
dirt	1
and	1
alone	1
quite	1
alone	1
What	1
could	1
she	1
mean	1
by	1
it	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
show	1
an	1
abominable	1
sort	1
of	1
conceited	1
independence	1
a	1
most	1
country	1
town	1
indifference	1
to	1
decorum	1
It	1
shows	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
pleasing	1
said	1
Bingley	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
observed	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
that	1
this	1
adventure	1
has	1
rather	1
affected	1
your	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
fine	1
eyes	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
he	1
replied	1
they	1
were	1
brightened	1
by	1
the	1
exercise	1
A	1
short	1
pause	1
followed	1
this	1
speech	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
began	1
again	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
excessive	1
regard	1
for	1
Miss	1
Jane	1
Bennet	1
she	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
girl	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
she	1
were	1
well	1
settled	1
But	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
and	1
such	1
low	1
connections	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
their	1
uncle	1
is	1
an	1
attorney	1
in	1
Meryton	1
Yes	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
another	1
who	1
lives	1
somewhere	1
near	1
Cheapside	1
That	1
is	1
capital	1
added	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
If	1
they	1
had	1
uncles	1
enough	1
to	1
fill	1
all	1
Cheapside	1
cried	1
Bingley	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
them	1
one	1
jot	1
less	1
agreeable	1
But	1
it	1
must	1
very	1
materially	1
lessen	1
their	1
chance	1
of	1
marrying	1
men	1
of	1
any	1
consideration	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
replied	1
Darcy	1
To	1
this	1
speech	1
Bingley	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
his	1
sisters	1
gave	1
it	1
their	1
hearty	1
assent	1
and	1
indulged	1
their	1
mirth	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
their	1
dear	1
friend	1
s	1
vulgar	1
relations	1
With	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
tenderness	1
however	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1
dining	1
parlour	1
and	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
till	1
summoned	1
to	1
coffee	1
She	1
was	1
still	1
very	1
poorly	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
quit	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
sleep	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
rather	1
right	1
than	1
pleasant	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
downstairs	1
herself	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
at	1
loo	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
invited	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
but	1
suspecting	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
playing	1
high	1
she	1
declined	1
it	1
and	1
making	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
excuse	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
amuse	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
she	1
could	1
stay	1
below	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
astonishment	1
Do	1
you	1
prefer	1
reading	1
to	1
cards	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
rather	1
singular	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
Bennet	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
despises	1
cards	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
reader	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
anything	1
else	1
I	1
deserve	1
neither	1
such	1
praise	1
nor	1
such	1
censure	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
reader	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
In	1
nursing	1
your	1
sister	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
have	1
pleasure	1
said	1
Bingley	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
soon	1
increased	1
by	1
seeing	1
her	1
quite	1
well	1
Elizabeth	1
thanked	1
him	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
books	1
were	1
lying	1
He	1
immediately	1
offered	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
others	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
library	1
afforded	1
And	1
I	1
wish	1
my	1
collection	1
were	1
larger	1
for	1
your	1
benefit	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
credit	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
idle	1
fellow	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
many	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
ever	1
looked	1
into	1
Elizabeth	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
suit	1
herself	1
perfectly	1
with	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
I	1
am	1
astonished	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
should	1
have	1
left	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
books	1
What	1
a	1
delightful	1
library	1
you	1
have	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
It	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
he	1
replied	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
many	1
generations	1
And	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
added	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
it	1
yourself	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
buying	1
books	1
I	1
cannot	1
comprehend	1
the	1
neglect	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
library	1
in	1
such	1
days	1
as	1
these	1
Neglect	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
neglect	1
nothing	1
that	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
that	1
noble	1
place	1
Charles	1
when	1
you	1
build	1
your	1
house	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
half	1
as	1
delightful	1
as	1
Pemberley	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
may	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
really	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
purchase	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
take	1
Pemberley	1
for	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
model	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
finer	1
county	1
in	1
England	1
than	1
Derbyshire	1
With	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
will	1
buy	1
Pemberley	1
itself	1
if	1
Darcy	1
will	1
sell	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
talking	1
of	1
possibilities	1
Charles	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
Caroline	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
more	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
Pemberley	1
by	1
purchase	1
than	1
by	1
imitation	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
caught	1
with	1
what	1
passed	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
very	1
little	1
attention	1
for	1
her	1
book	1
and	1
soon	1
laying	1
it	1
wholly	1
aside	1
she	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
card	1
table	1
and	1
stationed	1
herself	1
between	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
eldest	1
sister	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
game	1
Is	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
much	1
grown	1
since	1
the	1
spring	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
will	1
she	1
be	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
will	1
She	1
is	1
now	1
about	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
s	1
height	1
or	1
rather	1
taller	1
How	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again	1
I	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
anybody	1
who	1
delighted	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
Such	1
a	1
countenance	1
such	1
manners	1
And	1
so	1
extremely	1
accomplished	1
for	1
her	1
age	1
Her	1
performance	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
is	1
exquisite	1
It	1
is	1
amazing	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
Bingley	1
how	1
young	1
ladies	1
can	1
have	1
patience	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
accomplished	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
are	1
All	1
young	1
ladies	1
accomplished	1
My	1
dear	1
Charles	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Yes	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
think	1
They	1
all	1
paint	1
tables	1
cover	1
screens	1
and	1
net	1
purses	1
I	1
scarcely	1
know	1
anyone	1
who	1
cannot	1
do	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
without	1
being	1
informed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
accomplished	1
Your	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
extent	1
of	1
accomplishments	1
said	1
Darcy	1
has	1
too	1
much	1
truth	1
The	1
word	1
is	1
applied	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
deserves	1
it	1
no	1
otherwise	1
than	1
by	1
netting	1
a	1
purse	1
or	1
covering	1
a	1
screen	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
agreeing	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
estimation	1
of	1
ladies	1
in	1
general	1
I	1
cannot	1
boast	1
of	1
knowing	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
range	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
that	1
are	1
really	1
accomplished	1
Nor	1
I	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
Then	1
observed	1
Elizabeth	1
you	1
must	1
comprehend	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
your	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
accomplished	1
woman	1
Yes	1
I	1
do	1
comprehend	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
it	1
Oh	1
certainly	1
cried	1
his	1
faithful	1
assistant	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
really	1
esteemed	1
accomplished	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
greatly	1
surpass	1
what	1
is	1
usually	1
met	1
with	1
A	1
woman	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
thorough	1
knowledge	1
of	1
music	1
singing	1
drawing	1
dancing	1
and	1
the	1
modern	1
languages	1
to	1
deserve	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
possess	1
a	1
certain	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
air	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
walking	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
her	1
address	1
and	1
expressions	1
or	1
the	1
word	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
half	1
deserved	1
All	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
possess	1
added	1
Darcy	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
yet	1
add	1
something	1
more	1
substantial	1
in	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
by	1
extensive	1
reading	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
surprised	1
at	1
your	1
knowing	1
only	1
six	1
accomplished	1
women	1
I	1
rather	1
wonder	1
now	1
at	1
your	1
knowing	1
any	1
Are	1
you	1
so	1
severe	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
sex	1
as	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
capacity	1
and	1
taste	1
and	1
application	1
and	1
elegance	1
as	1
you	1
describe	1
united	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
both	1
cried	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
her	1
implied	1
doubt	1
and	1
were	1
both	1
protesting	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
many	1
women	1
who	1
answered	1
this	1
description	1
when	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
order	1
with	1
bitter	1
complaints	1
of	1
their	1
inattention	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forward	1
As	1
all	1
conversation	1
was	1
thereby	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed	1
on	1
her	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
seek	1
to	1
recommend	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
sex	1
by	1
undervaluing	1
their	1
own	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
men	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
succeeds	1
But	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
paltry	1
device	1
a	1
very	1
mean	1
art	1
Undoubtedly	1
replied	1
Darcy	1
to	1
whom	1
this	1
remark	1
was	1
chiefly	1
addressed	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
meanness	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
arts	1
which	1
ladies	1
sometimes	1
condescend	1
to	1
employ	1
for	1
captivation	1
Whatever	1
bears	1
affinity	1
to	1
cunning	1
is	1
despicable	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
entirely	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
reply	1
as	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
subject	1
Elizabeth	1
joined	1
them	1
again	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
worse	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
her	1
Bingley	1
urged	1
Mr	1
Jones	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
immediately	1
while	1
his	1
sisters	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
country	1
advice	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
recommended	1
an	1
express	1
to	1
town	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
eminent	1
physicians	1
This	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
unwilling	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
proposal	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
Mr	1
Jones	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
if	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
were	1
not	1
decidedly	1
better	1
Bingley	1
was	1
quite	1
uncomfortable	1
his	1
sisters	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
miserable	1
They	1
solaced	1
their	1
wretchedness	1
however	1
by	1
duets	1
after	1
supper	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
better	1
relief	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
than	1
by	1
giving	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
directions	1
that	1
every	1
attention	1
might	1
be	1
paid	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
lady	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
Chapter	1
9	1
Elizabeth	1
passed	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
room	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
tolerable	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
inquiries	1
which	1
she	1
very	1
early	1
received	1
from	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
by	1
a	1
housemaid	1
and	1
some	1
time	1
afterwards	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
elegant	1
ladies	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
his	1
sisters	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
amendment	1
however	1
she	1
requested	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
note	1
sent	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
desiring	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
visit	1
Jane	1
and	1
form	1
her	1
own	1
judgement	1
of	1
her	1
situation	1
The	1
note	1
was	1
immediately	1
dispatched	1
and	1
its	1
contents	1
as	1
quickly	1
complied	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
accompanied	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
youngest	1
girls	1
reached	1
Netherfield	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
family	1
breakfast	1
Had	1
she	1
found	1
Jane	1
in	1
any	1
apparent	1
danger	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
miserable	1
but	1
being	1
satisfied	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
illness	1
was	1
not	1
alarming	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
of	1
her	1
recovering	1
immediately	1
as	1
her	1
restoration	1
to	1
health	1
would	1
probably	1
remove	1
her	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
therefore	1
to	1
her	1
daughter	1
s	1
proposal	1
of	1
being	1
carried	1
home	1
neither	1
did	1
the	1
apothecary	1
who	1
arrived	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
think	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
advisable	1
After	1
sitting	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
with	1
Jane	1
on	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
appearance	1
and	1
invitation	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
three	1
daughters	1
all	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
Bingley	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
hopes	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
worse	1
than	1
she	1
expected	1
Indeed	1
I	1
have	1
sir	1
was	1
her	1
answer	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
ill	1
to	1
be	1
moved	1
Mr	1
Jones	1
says	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
moving	1
her	1
We	1
must	1
trespass	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
on	1
your	1
kindness	1
Removed	1
cried	1
Bingley	1
It	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
My	1
sister	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
removal	1
You	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
Madam	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
with	1
cold	1
civility	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
will	1
receive	1
every	1
possible	1
attention	1
while	1
she	1
remains	1
with	1
us	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
profuse	1
in	1
her	1
acknowledgments	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
added	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
such	1
good	1
friends	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
ill	1
indeed	1
and	1
suffers	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
though	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
patience	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
without	1
exception	1
the	1
sweetest	1
temper	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
met	1
with	1
I	1
often	1
tell	1
my	1
other	1
girls	1
they	1
are	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
sweet	1
room	1
here	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
prospect	1
over	1
the	1
gravel	1
walk	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
that	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
quitting	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
I	1
hope	1
though	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
lease	1
Whatever	1
I	1
do	1
is	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
replied	1
he	1
and	1
therefore	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
resolve	1
to	1
quit	1
Netherfield	1
I	1
should	1
probably	1
be	1
off	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
At	1
present	1
however	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
as	1
quite	1
fixed	1
here	1
That	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
supposed	1
of	1
you	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
You	1
begin	1
to	1
comprehend	1
me	1
do	1
you	1
cried	1
he	1
turning	1
towards	1
her	1
Oh	1
yes	1
I	1
understand	1
you	1
perfectly	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
compliment	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
seen	1
through	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
is	1
pitiful	1
That	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
happens	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
a	1
deep	1
intricate	1
character	1
is	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
estimable	1
than	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
yours	1
Lizzy	1
cried	1
her	1
mother	1
remember	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
run	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
manner	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
suffered	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
home	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
before	1
continued	1
Bingley	1
immediately	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
studier	1
of	1
character	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
amusing	1
study	1
Yes	1
but	1
intricate	1
characters	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
amusing	1
They	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
advantage	1
The	1
country	1
said	1
Darcy	1
can	1
in	1
general	1
supply	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
subjects	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
study	1
In	1
a	1
country	1
neighbourhood	1
you	1
move	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
confined	1
and	1
unvarying	1
society	1
But	1
people	1
themselves	1
alter	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
new	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
in	1
them	1
for	1
ever	1
Yes	1
indeed	1
cried	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
offended	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
mentioning	1
a	1
country	1
neighbourhood	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
in	1
town	1
Everybody	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
Darcy	1
after	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
turned	1
silently	1
away	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
who	1
fancied	1
she	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
him	1
continued	1
her	1
triumph	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
that	1
London	1
has	1
any	1
great	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
except	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
public	1
places	1
The	1
country	1
is	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
pleasanter	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
replied	1
I	1
never	1
wish	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
town	1
it	1
is	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
They	1
have	1
each	1
their	1
advantages	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
equally	1
happy	1
in	1
either	1
Aye	1
that	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
disposition	1
But	1
that	1
gentleman	1
looking	1
at	1
Darcy	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
Indeed	1
Mamma	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
blushing	1
for	1
her	1
mother	1
You	1
quite	1
mistook	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
He	1
only	1
meant	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
Certainly	1
my	1
dear	1
nobody	1
said	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
not	1
meeting	1
with	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
neighbourhood	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
neighbourhoods	1
larger	1
I	1
know	1
we	1
dine	1
with	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
families	1
Nothing	1
but	1
concern	1
for	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
enable	1
Bingley	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
countenance	1
His	1
sister	1
was	1
less	1
delicate	1
and	1
directed	1
her	1
eyes	1
towards	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
expressive	1
smile	1
Elizabeth	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
turn	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
thoughts	1
now	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
since	1
her	1
coming	1
away	1
Yes	1
she	1
called	1
yesterday	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
What	1
an	1
agreeable	1
man	1
Sir	1
William	1
is	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
fashion	1
So	1
genteel	1
and	1
easy	1
He	1
has	1
always	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
everybody	1
That	1
is	1
my	1
idea	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
and	1
those	1
persons	1
who	1
fancy	1
themselves	1
very	1
important	1
and	1
never	1
open	1
their	1
mouths	1
quite	1
mistake	1
the	1
matter	1
Did	1
Charlotte	1
dine	1
with	1
you	1
No	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
home	1
I	1
fancy	1
she	1
was	1
wanted	1
about	1
the	1
mince	1
pies	1
For	1
my	1
part	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
I	1
always	1
keep	1
servants	1
that	1
can	1
do	1
their	1
own	1
work	1
my	1
daughters	1
are	1
brought	1
up	1
very	1
differently	1
But	1
everybody	1
is	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
Lucases	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
girls	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
handsome	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
Charlotte	1
so	1
very	1
plain	1
but	1
then	1
she	1
is	1
our	1
particular	1
friend	1
She	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
young	1
woman	1
Oh	1
dear	1
yes	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
own	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
plain	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
herself	1
has	1
often	1
said	1
so	1
and	1
envied	1
me	1
Jane	1
s	1
beauty	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
boast	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
child	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
Jane	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
see	1
anybody	1
better	1
looking	1
It	1
is	1
what	1
everybody	1
says	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
trust	1
my	1
own	1
partiality	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
fifteen	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
my	1
brother	1
Gardiner	1
s	1
in	1
town	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
before	1
we	1
came	1
away	1
But	1
however	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
too	1
young	1
However	1
he	1
wrote	1
some	1
verses	1
on	1
her	1
and	1
very	1
pretty	1
they	1
were	1
And	1
so	1
ended	1
his	1
affection	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
impatiently	1
There	1
has	1
been	1
many	1
a	1
one	1
I	1
fancy	1
overcome	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
I	1
wonder	1
who	1
first	1
discovered	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
poetry	1
in	1
driving	1
away	1
love	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
consider	1
poetry	1
as	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
love	1
said	1
Darcy	1
Of	1
a	1
fine	1
stout	1
healthy	1
love	1
it	1
may	1
Everything	1
nourishes	1
what	1
is	1
strong	1
already	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
slight	1
thin	1
sort	1
of	1
inclination	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
one	1
good	1
sonnet	1
will	1
starve	1
it	1
entirely	1
away	1
Darcy	1
only	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
pause	1
which	1
ensued	1
made	1
Elizabeth	1
tremble	1
lest	1
her	1
mother	1
should	1
be	1
exposing	1
herself	1
again	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
began	1
repeating	1
her	1
thanks	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
Jane	1
with	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
troubling	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
Lizzy	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
was	1
unaffectedly	1
civil	1
in	1
his	1
answer	1
and	1
forced	1
his	1
younger	1
sister	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
also	1
and	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
occasion	1
required	1
She	1
performed	1
her	1
part	1
indeed	1
without	1
much	1
graciousness	1
but	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
satisfied	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
ordered	1
her	1
carriage	1
Upon	1
this	1
signal	1
the	1
youngest	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
put	1
herself	1
forward	1
The	1
two	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
whispering	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
visit	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
youngest	1
should	1
tax	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
with	1
having	1
promised	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
Lydia	1
was	1
a	1
stout	1
well	1
grown	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
complexion	1
and	1
good	1
humoured	1
countenance	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
whose	1
affection	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
public	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
age	1
She	1
had	1
high	1
animal	1
spirits	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
natural	1
self	1
consequence	1
which	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
whom	1
her	1
uncle	1
s	1
good	1
dinners	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
easy	1
manners	1
recommended	1
her	1
had	1
increased	1
into	1
assurance	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
equal	1
therefore	1
to	1
address	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
and	1
abruptly	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
adding	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
shameful	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
it	1
His	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
sudden	1
attack	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
s	1
ear	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
ready	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
engagement	1
and	1
when	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
recovered	1
you	1
shall	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
name	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
But	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
dancing	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
ill	1
Lydia	1
declared	1
herself	1
satisfied	1
Oh	1
yes	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
Jane	1
was	1
well	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
most	1
likely	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
Meryton	1
again	1
And	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
your	1
ball	1
she	1
added	1
I	1
shall	1
insist	1
on	1
their	1
giving	1
one	1
also	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
shame	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
then	1
departed	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
returned	1
instantly	1
to	1
Jane	1
leaving	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
her	1
relations	1
behaviour	1
to	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
and	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
whom	1
however	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
their	1
censure	1
of	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
witticisms	1
on	1
fine	1
eyes	1
Chapter	1
10	1
The	1
day	1
passed	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
had	1
done	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
the	1
invalid	1
who	1
continued	1
though	1
slowly	1
to	1
mend	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Elizabeth	1
joined	1
their	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
The	1
loo	1
table	1
however	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
was	1
writing	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
seated	1
near	1
him	1
was	1
watching	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
calling	1
off	1
his	1
attention	1
by	1
messages	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
were	1
at	1
piquet	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
was	1
observing	1
their	1
game	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
up	1
some	1
needlework	1
and	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
amused	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
Darcy	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
The	1
perpetual	1
commendations	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
either	1
on	1
his	1
handwriting	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
evenness	1
of	1
his	1
lines	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
with	1
the	1
perfect	1
unconcern	1
with	1
which	1
her	1
praises	1
were	1
received	1
formed	1
a	1
curious	1
dialogue	1
and	1
was	1
exactly	1
in	1
union	1
with	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
each	1
How	1
delighted	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
receive	1
such	1
a	1
letter	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
You	1
write	1
uncommonly	1
fast	1
You	1
are	1
mistaken	1
I	1
write	1
rather	1
slowly	1
How	1
many	1
letters	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
occasion	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
Letters	1
of	1
business	1
too	1
How	1
odious	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
them	1
It	1
is	1
fortunate	1
then	1
that	1
they	1
fall	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
instead	1
of	1
yours	1
Pray	1
tell	1
your	1
sister	1
that	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
her	1
so	1
once	1
by	1
your	1
desire	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
your	1
pen	1
Let	1
me	1
mend	1
it	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
mend	1
pens	1
remarkably	1
well	1
Thank	1
you	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
mend	1
my	1
own	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
contrive	1
to	1
write	1
so	1
even	1
He	1
was	1
silent	1
Tell	1
your	1
sister	1
I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
improvement	1
on	1
the	1
harp	1
and	1
pray	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
in	1
raptures	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
little	1
design	1
for	1
a	1
table	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
infinitely	1
superior	1
to	1
Miss	1
Grantley	1
s	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
defer	1
your	1
raptures	1
till	1
I	1
write	1
again	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
room	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
justice	1
Oh	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
January	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
always	1
write	1
such	1
charming	1
long	1
letters	1
to	1
her	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
They	1
are	1
generally	1
long	1
but	1
whether	1
always	1
charming	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
determine	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
rule	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
can	1
write	1
a	1
long	1
letter	1
with	1
ease	1
cannot	1
write	1
ill	1
That	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
Darcy	1
Caroline	1
cried	1
her	1
brother	1
because	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
write	1
with	1
ease	1
He	1
studies	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
words	1
of	1
four	1
syllables	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
Darcy	1
My	1
style	1
of	1
writing	1
is	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
yours	1
Oh	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
Charles	1
writes	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
careless	1
way	1
imaginable	1
He	1
leaves	1
out	1
half	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
blots	1
the	1
rest	1
My	1
ideas	1
flow	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
express	1
them	1
by	1
which	1
means	1
my	1
letters	1
sometimes	1
convey	1
no	1
ideas	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
my	1
correspondents	1
Your	1
humility	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
must	1
disarm	1
reproof	1
Nothing	1
is	1
more	1
deceitful	1
said	1
Darcy	1
than	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
humility	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
only	1
carelessness	1
of	1
opinion	1
and	1
sometimes	1
an	1
indirect	1
boast	1
And	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
my	1
little	1
recent	1
piece	1
of	1
modesty	1
The	1
indirect	1
boast	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
proud	1
of	1
your	1
defects	1
in	1
writing	1
because	1
you	1
consider	1
them	1
as	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
rapidity	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
carelessness	1
of	1
execution	1
which	1
if	1
not	1
estimable	1
you	1
think	1
at	1
least	1
highly	1
interesting	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
with	1
quickness	1
is	1
always	1
prized	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
possessor	1
and	1
often	1
without	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
performance	1
When	1
you	1
told	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
this	1
morning	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
resolved	1
upon	1
quitting	1
Netherfield	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
gone	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
you	1
meant	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
panegyric	1
of	1
compliment	1
to	1
yourself	1
and	1
yet	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
so	1
very	1
laudable	1
in	1
a	1
precipitance	1
which	1
must	1
leave	1
very	1
necessary	1
business	1
undone	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
real	1
advantage	1
to	1
yourself	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
Nay	1
cried	1
Bingley	1
this	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
remember	1
at	1
night	1
all	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
And	1
yet	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
believe	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
of	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
At	1
least	1
therefore	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
assume	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
needless	1
precipitance	1
merely	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
believed	1
it	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
convinced	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
gone	1
with	1
such	1
celerity	1
Your	1
conduct	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
dependent	1
on	1
chance	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
if	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
mounting	1
your	1
horse	1
a	1
friend	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
Bingley	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
stay	1
till	1
next	1
week	1
you	1
would	1
probably	1
do	1
it	1
you	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
go	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
word	1
might	1
stay	1
a	1
month	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
proved	1
by	1
this	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
that	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
disposition	1
You	1
have	1
shown	1
him	1
off	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
himself	1
I	1
am	1
exceedingly	1
gratified	1
said	1
Bingley	1
by	1
your	1
converting	1
what	1
my	1
friend	1
says	1
into	1
a	1
compliment	1
on	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
my	1
temper	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
are	1
giving	1
it	1
a	1
turn	1
which	1
that	1
gentleman	1
did	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
intend	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
think	1
better	1
of	1
me	1
if	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
circumstance	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
flat	1
denial	1
and	1
ride	1
off	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
Would	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
then	1
consider	1
the	1
rashness	1
of	1
your	1
original	1
intentions	1
as	1
atoned	1
for	1
by	1
your	1
obstinacy	1
in	1
adhering	1
to	1
it	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
I	1
cannot	1
exactly	1
explain	1
the	1
matter	1
Darcy	1
must	1
speak	1
for	1
himself	1
You	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
opinions	1
which	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
call	1
mine	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
acknowledged	1
Allowing	1
the	1
case	1
however	1
to	1
stand	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
representation	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
that	1
the	1
friend	1
who	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
desire	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
delay	1
of	1
his	1
plan	1
has	1
merely	1
desired	1
it	1
asked	1
it	1
without	1
offering	1
one	1
argument	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
its	1
propriety	1
To	1
yield	1
readily	1
easily	1
to	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
is	1
no	1
merit	1
with	1
you	1
To	1
yield	1
without	1
conviction	1
is	1
no	1
compliment	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
either	1
You	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
to	1
allow	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
affection	1
A	1
regard	1
for	1
the	1
requester	1
would	1
often	1
make	1
one	1
readily	1
yield	1
to	1
a	1
request	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
arguments	1
to	1
reason	1
one	1
into	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
particularly	1
speaking	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
supposed	1
about	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
We	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
wait	1
perhaps	1
till	1
the	1
circumstance	1
occurs	1
before	1
we	1
discuss	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour	1
thereupon	1
But	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
ordinary	1
cases	1
between	1
friend	1
and	1
friend	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
desired	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
change	1
a	1
resolution	1
of	1
no	1
very	1
great	1
moment	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
that	1
person	1
for	1
complying	1
with	1
the	1
desire	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
argued	1
into	1
it	1
Will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
advisable	1
before	1
we	1
proceed	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
to	1
arrange	1
with	1
rather	1
more	1
precision	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
appertain	1
to	1
this	1
request	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
intimacy	1
subsisting	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
By	1
all	1
means	1
cried	1
Bingley	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
not	1
forgetting	1
their	1
comparative	1
height	1
and	1
size	1
for	1
that	1
will	1
have	1
more	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
argument	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
than	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
Darcy	1
were	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
tall	1
fellow	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
myself	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
pay	1
him	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
deference	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
more	1
awful	1
object	1
than	1
Darcy	1
on	1
particular	1
occasions	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
places	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
especially	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
Sunday	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
smiled	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
rather	1
offended	1
and	1
therefore	1
checked	1
her	1
laugh	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
warmly	1
resented	1
the	1
indignity	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
an	1
expostulation	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
for	1
talking	1
such	1
nonsense	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
design	1
Bingley	1
said	1
his	1
friend	1
You	1
dislike	1
an	1
argument	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
silence	1
this	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
do	1
Arguments	1
are	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
disputes	1
If	1
you	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
will	1
defer	1
yours	1
till	1
I	1
am	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
thankful	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
whatever	1
you	1
like	1
of	1
me	1
What	1
you	1
ask	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
is	1
no	1
sacrifice	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
finish	1
his	1
letter	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
took	1
her	1
advice	1
and	1
did	1
finish	1
his	1
letter	1
When	1
that	1
business	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
applied	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
for	1
an	1
indulgence	1
of	1
some	1
music	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
moved	1
with	1
some	1
alacrity	1
to	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
polite	1
request	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
lead	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
politely	1
and	1
more	1
earnestly	1
negatived	1
she	1
seated	1
herself	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
sang	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
employed	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
observing	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
over	1
some	1
music	1
books	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
instrument	1
how	1
frequently	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
She	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
admiration	1
to	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
disliked	1
her	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
strange	1
She	1
could	1
only	1
imagine	1
however	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
she	1
drew	1
his	1
notice	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
wrong	1
and	1
reprehensible	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ideas	1
of	1
right	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
present	1
The	1
supposition	1
did	1
not	1
pain	1
her	1
She	1
liked	1
him	1
too	1
little	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
his	1
approbation	1
After	1
playing	1
some	1
Italian	1
songs	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
varied	1
the	1
charm	1
by	1
a	1
lively	1
Scotch	1
air	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
drawing	1
near	1
Elizabeth	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
feel	1
a	1
great	1
inclination	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
to	1
seize	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
dancing	1
a	1
reel	1
She	1
smiled	1
but	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
He	1
repeated	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
her	1
silence	1
Oh	1
said	1
she	1
I	1
heard	1
you	1
before	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
determine	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply	1
You	1
wanted	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
to	1
say	1
Yes	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
despising	1
my	1
taste	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
delight	1
in	1
overthrowing	1
those	1
kind	1
of	1
schemes	1
and	1
cheating	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
their	1
premeditated	1
contempt	1
I	1
have	1
therefore	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
dance	1
a	1
reel	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
now	1
despise	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
dare	1
Indeed	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
dare	1
Elizabeth	1
having	1
rather	1
expected	1
to	1
affront	1
him	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
gallantry	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
sweetness	1
and	1
archness	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
affront	1
anybody	1
and	1
Darcy	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
bewitched	1
by	1
any	1
woman	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
He	1
really	1
believed	1
that	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
inferiority	1
of	1
her	1
connections	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
danger	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
saw	1
or	1
suspected	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
jealous	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
her	1
dear	1
friend	1
Jane	1
received	1
some	1
assistance	1
from	1
her	1
desire	1
of	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
She	1
often	1
tried	1
to	1
provoke	1
Darcy	1
into	1
disliking	1
her	1
guest	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
supposed	1
marriage	1
and	1
planning	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
alliance	1
I	1
hope	1
said	1
she	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
your	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
a	1
few	1
hints	1
when	1
this	1
desirable	1
event	1
takes	1
place	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
holding	1
her	1
tongue	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
compass	1
it	1
do	1
cure	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
of	1
running	1
after	1
officers	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
mention	1
so	1
delicate	1
a	1
subject	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
that	1
little	1
something	1
bordering	1
on	1
conceit	1
and	1
impertinence	1
which	1
your	1
lady	1
possesses	1
Have	1
you	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
propose	1
for	1
my	1
domestic	1
felicity	1
Oh	1
yes	1
Do	1
let	1
the	1
portraits	1
of	1
your	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
Phillips	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
Put	1
them	1
next	1
to	1
your	1
great	1
uncle	1
the	1
judge	1
They	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
profession	1
you	1
know	1
only	1
in	1
different	1
lines	1
As	1
for	1
your	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
picture	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
have	1
it	1
taken	1
for	1
what	1
painter	1
could	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
those	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
easy	1
indeed	1
to	1
catch	1
their	1
expression	1
but	1
their	1
colour	1
and	1
shape	1
and	1
the	1
eyelashes	1
so	1
remarkably	1
fine	1
might	1
be	1
copied	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
from	1
another	1
walk	1
by	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
herself	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
intended	1
to	1
walk	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
in	1
some	1
confusion	1
lest	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
overheard	1
You	1
used	1
us	1
abominably	1
ill	1
answered	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
running	1
away	1
without	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
coming	1
out	1
Then	1
taking	1
the	1
disengaged	1
arm	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
she	1
left	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
walk	1
by	1
herself	1
The	1
path	1
just	1
admitted	1
three	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
felt	1
their	1
rudeness	1
and	1
immediately	1
said	1
This	1
walk	1
is	1
not	1
wide	1
enough	1
for	1
our	1
party	1
We	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
avenue	1
But	1
Elizabeth	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
inclination	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
them	1
laughingly	1
answered	1
No	1
no	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
You	1
are	1
charmingly	1
grouped	1
and	1
appear	1
to	1
uncommon	1
advantage	1
The	1
picturesque	1
would	1
be	1
spoilt	1
by	1
admitting	1
a	1
fourth	1
Good	1
bye	1
She	1
then	1
ran	1
gaily	1
off	1
rejoicing	1
as	1
she	1
rambled	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
home	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
Jane	1
was	1
already	1
so	1
much	1
recovered	1
as	1
to	1
intend	1
leaving	1
her	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
that	1
evening	1
Chapter	1
11	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
removed	1
after	1
dinner	1
Elizabeth	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
well	1
guarded	1
from	1
cold	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
friends	1
with	1
many	1
professions	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
them	1
so	1
agreeable	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
during	1
the	1
hour	1
which	1
passed	1
before	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
appeared	1
Their	1
powers	1
of	1
conversation	1
were	1
considerable	1
They	1
could	1
describe	1
an	1
entertainment	1
with	1
accuracy	1
relate	1
an	1
anecdote	1
with	1
humour	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
spirit	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
entered	1
Jane	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
first	1
object	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
instantly	1
turned	1
toward	1
Darcy	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
advanced	1
many	1
steps	1
He	1
addressed	1
himself	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
with	1
a	1
polite	1
congratulation	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
also	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
but	1
diffuseness	1
and	1
warmth	1
remained	1
for	1
Bingley	1
s	1
salutation	1
He	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
attention	1
The	1
first	1
half	1
hour	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
piling	1
up	1
the	1
fire	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
removed	1
at	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
He	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
talked	1
scarcely	1
to	1
anyone	1

Elizabeth	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
corner	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
with	1
great	1
delight	1
When	1
tea	1
was	1
over	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
reminded	1
his	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
card	1
table	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
She	1
had	1
obtained	1
private	1
intelligence	1
that	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
cards	1
and	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
soon	1
found	1
even	1
his	1
open	1
petition	1
rejected	1
She	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
intended	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
seemed	1
to	1
justify	1
her	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
had	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sofas	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
Darcy	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
principally	1
occupied	1
in	1
playing	1
with	1
her	1
bracelets	1
and	1
rings	1
joined	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
conversation	1
with	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
attention	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
engaged	1
in	1
watching	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
progress	1
through	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
in	1
reading	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
perpetually	1
either	1
making	1
some	1
inquiry	1
or	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
page	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
win	1
him	1
however	1
to	1
any	1
conversation	1
he	1
merely	1
answered	1
her	1
question	1
and	1
read	1
on	1
At	1
length	1
quite	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
be	1
amused	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
book	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
chosen	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
volume	1
of	1
his	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
great	1
yawn	1
and	1
said	1
How	1
pleasant	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
spend	1
an	1
evening	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
I	1
declare	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
enjoyment	1
like	1
reading	1
How	1
much	1
sooner	1
one	1
tires	1
of	1
anything	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
miserable	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
excellent	1
library	1
No	1
one	1
made	1
any	1
reply	1
She	1
then	1
yawned	1
again	1
threw	1
aside	1
her	1
book	1
and	1
cast	1
her	1
eyes	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
quest	1
for	1
some	1
amusement	1
when	1
hearing	1
her	1
brother	1
mentioning	1
a	1
ball	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
she	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
By	1
the	1
bye	1
Charles	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
serious	1
in	1
meditating	1
a	1
dance	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
before	1
you	1
determine	1
on	1
it	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
party	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
some	1
among	1
us	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
ball	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
punishment	1
than	1
a	1
pleasure	1
If	1
you	1
mean	1
Darcy	1
cried	1
her	1
brother	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
if	1
he	1
chooses	1
before	1
it	1
begins	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
ball	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
settled	1
thing	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Nicholls	1
has	1
made	1
white	1
soup	1
enough	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
round	1
my	1
cards	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
balls	1
infinitely	1
better	1
she	1
replied	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
insufferably	1
tedious	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
process	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
meeting	1
It	1
would	1
surely	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
rational	1
if	1
conversation	1
instead	1
of	1
dancing	1
were	1
made	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
Much	1
more	1
rational	1
my	1
dear	1
Caroline	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
near	1
so	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
Her	1
figure	1
was	1
elegant	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
well	1
but	1
Darcy	1
at	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
aimed	1
was	1
still	1
inflexibly	1
studious	1
In	1
the	1
desperation	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
she	1
resolved	1
on	1
one	1
effort	1
more	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
said	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
Bennet	1
let	1
me	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
my	1
example	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
turn	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
refreshing	1
after	1
sitting	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
one	1
attitude	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
surprised	1
but	1
agreed	1
to	1
it	1
immediately	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
succeeded	1
no	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
real	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
civility	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
up	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
awake	1
to	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
attention	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
herself	1
could	1
be	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
closed	1
his	1
book	1
He	1
was	1
directly	1
invited	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
party	1
but	1
he	1
declined	1
it	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
imagine	1
but	1
two	1
motives	1
for	1
their	1
choosing	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
together	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
which	1
motives	1
his	1
joining	1
them	1
would	1
interfere	1
What	1
could	1
he	1
mean	1
She	1
was	1
dying	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
his	1
meaning	1
and	1
asked	1
Elizabeth	1
whether	1
she	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
understand	1
him	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
was	1
her	1
answer	1
but	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
on	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
surest	1
way	1
of	1
disappointing	1
him	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
ask	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
however	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
disappointing	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
in	1
anything	1
and	1
persevered	1
therefore	1
in	1
requiring	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
motives	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
to	1
explaining	1
them	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
You	1
either	1
choose	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
evening	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
confidence	1
and	1
have	1
secret	1
affairs	1
to	1
discuss	1
or	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
conscious	1
that	1
your	1
figures	1
appear	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
advantage	1
in	1
walking	1
if	1
the	1
first	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
completely	1
in	1
your	1
way	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
second	1
I	1
can	1
admire	1
you	1
much	1
better	1
as	1
I	1
sit	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
Oh	1
shocking	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
anything	1
so	1
abominable	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
speech	1
Nothing	1
so	1
easy	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
the	1
inclination	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
We	1
can	1
all	1
plague	1
and	1
punish	1
one	1
another	1
Tease	1
him	1
laugh	1
at	1
him	1
Intimate	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
But	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
intimacy	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
taught	1
me	1
that	1
Tease	1
calmness	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
No	1
no	1
I	1
feel	1
he	1
may	1
defy	1
us	1
there	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
laughter	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
expose	1
ourselves	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
by	1
attempting	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
a	1
subject	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
may	1
hug	1
himself	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
That	1
is	1
an	1
uncommon	1
advantage	1
and	1
uncommon	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
continue	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
such	1
acquaintances	1
I	1
dearly	1
love	1
a	1
laugh	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
said	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
more	1
credit	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
The	1
wisest	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
men	1
nay	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
their	1
actions	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
ridiculous	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
whose	1
first	1
object	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
joke	1
Certainly	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
there	1
are	1
such	1
people	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
never	1
ridicule	1
what	1
is	1
wise	1
and	1
good	1
Follies	1
and	1
nonsense	1
whims	1
and	1
inconsistencies	1
do	1
divert	1
me	1
I	1
own	1
and	1
I	1
laugh	1
at	1
them	1
whenever	1
I	1
can	1
But	1
these	1
I	1
suppose	1
are	1
precisely	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
without	1
Perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
for	1
anyone	1
But	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
avoid	1
those	1
weaknesses	1
which	1
often	1
expose	1
a	1
strong	1
understanding	1
to	1
ridicule	1
Such	1
as	1
vanity	1
and	1
pride	1
Yes	1
vanity	1
is	1
a	1
weakness	1
indeed	1
But	1
pride	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
superiority	1
of	1
mind	1
pride	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
under	1
good	1
regulation	1
Elizabeth	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
hide	1
a	1
smile	1
Your	1
examination	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
over	1
I	1
presume	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
pray	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
by	1
it	1
that	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
has	1
no	1
defect	1
He	1
owns	1
it	1
himself	1
without	1
disguise	1
No	1
said	1
Darcy	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
such	1
pretension	1
I	1
have	1
faults	1
enough	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
I	1
hope	1
of	1
understanding	1
My	1
temper	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
vouch	1
for	1
It	1
is	1
I	1
believe	1
too	1
little	1
yielding	1
certainly	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
cannot	1
forget	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
vices	1
of	1
others	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
nor	1
their	1
offenses	1
against	1
myself	1
My	1
feelings	1
are	1
not	1
puffed	1
about	1
with	1
every	1
attempt	1
to	1
move	1
them	1
My	1
temper	1
would	1
perhaps	1
be	1
called	1
resentful	1
My	1
good	1
opinion	1
once	1
lost	1
is	1
lost	1
forever	1
That	1
is	1
a	1
failing	1
indeed	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
Implacable	1
resentment	1
is	1
a	1
shade	1
in	1
a	1
character	1
But	1
you	1
have	1
chosen	1
your	1
fault	1
well	1
I	1
really	1
cannot	1
laugh	1
at	1
it	1
You	1
are	1
safe	1
from	1
me	1
There	1
is	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
every	1
disposition	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
some	1
particular	1
evil	1
a	1
natural	1
defect	1
which	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
best	1
education	1
can	1
overcome	1
And	1
your	1
defect	1
is	1
to	1
hate	1
everybody	1
And	1
yours	1
he	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
is	1
willfully	1
to	1
misunderstand	1
them	1
Do	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
music	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
tired	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
share	1
Louisa	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
mind	1
my	1
waking	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
Her	1
sister	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
and	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
Darcy	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
recollection	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
paying	1
Elizabeth	1
too	1
much	1
attention	1
Chapter	1
12	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
an	1
agreement	1
between	1
the	1
sisters	1
Elizabeth	1
wrote	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
their	1
mother	1
to	1
beg	1
that	1
the	1
carriage	1
might	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
But	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
who	1
had	1
calculated	1
on	1
her	1
daughters	1
remaining	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
Tuesday	1
which	1
would	1
exactly	1
finish	1
Jane	1
s	1
week	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
with	1
pleasure	1
before	1
Her	1
answer	1
therefore	1
was	1
not	1
propitious	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
wishes	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
sent	1
them	1
word	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
before	1
Tuesday	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
postscript	1
it	1
was	1
added	1
that	1
if	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
pressed	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
longer	1
she	1
could	1
spare	1
them	1
very	1
well	1
Against	1
staying	1
longer	1
however	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
positively	1
resolved	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
much	1
expect	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
and	1
fearful	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
as	1
being	1
considered	1
as	1
intruding	1
themselves	1
needlessly	1
long	1
she	1
urged	1
Jane	1
to	1
borrow	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
carriage	1
immediately	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
their	1
original	1
design	1
of	1
leaving	1
Netherfield	1
that	1
morning	1
should	1
be	1
mentioned	1
and	1
the	1
request	1
made	1
The	1
communication	1
excited	1
many	1
professions	1
of	1
concern	1
and	1
enough	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
wishing	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
Jane	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
morrow	1
their	1
going	1
was	1
deferred	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
then	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
proposed	1
the	1
delay	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
and	1
dislike	1
of	1
one	1
sister	1
much	1
exceeded	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
The	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
heard	1
with	1
real	1
sorrow	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
soon	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
safe	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
recovered	1
but	1
Jane	1
was	1
firm	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
right	1
To	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
it	1
was	1
welcome	1
intelligence	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
long	1
enough	1
She	1
attracted	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
liked	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
uncivil	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
more	1
teasing	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
himself	1
He	1
wisely	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
careful	1
that	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
admiration	1
should	1
now	1
escape	1
him	1
nothing	1
that	1
could	1
elevate	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
influencing	1
his	1
felicity	1
sensible	1
that	1
if	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
been	1
suggested	1
his	1
behaviour	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
must	1
have	1
material	1
weight	1
in	1
confirming	1
or	1
crushing	1
it	1
Steady	1
to	1
his	1
purpose	1
he	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
ten	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Saturday	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
left	1
by	1
themselves	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
he	1
adhered	1
most	1
conscientiously	1
to	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
On	1
Sunday	1
after	1
morning	1
service	1
the	1
separation	1
so	1
agreeable	1
to	1
almost	1
all	1
took	1
place	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
civility	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
increased	1
at	1
last	1
very	1
rapidly	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
Jane	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
parted	1
after	1
assuring	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
it	1
would	1
always	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
either	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
or	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
embracing	1
her	1
most	1
tenderly	1
she	1
even	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
former	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
liveliest	1
of	1
spirits	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
welcomed	1
home	1
very	1
cordially	1
by	1
their	1
mother	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
wondered	1
at	1
their	1
coming	1
and	1
thought	1
them	1
very	1
wrong	1
to	1
give	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
and	1
was	1
sure	1
Jane	1
would	1
have	1
caught	1
cold	1
again	1
But	1
their	1
father	1
though	1
very	1
laconic	1
in	1
his	1
expressions	1
of	1
pleasure	1
was	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
their	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
The	1
evening	1
conversation	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
assembled	1
had	1
lost	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
animation	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
its	1
sense	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
They	1
found	1
Mary	1
as	1
usual	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
thorough	1
bass	1
and	1
human	1
nature	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
extracts	1
to	1
admire	1
and	1
some	1
new	1
observations	1
of	1
threadbare	1
morality	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
had	1
information	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
Much	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
and	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
since	1
the	1
preceding	1
Wednesday	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
had	1
dined	1
lately	1
with	1
their	1
uncle	1
a	1
private	1
had	1
been	1
flogged	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
hinted	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married	1

I	1
hope	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
breakfast	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
ordered	1
a	1
good	1
dinner	1
to	1
day	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
our	1
family	1
party	1
Who	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
my	1
dear	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
nobody	1
that	1
is	1
coming	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
unless	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
my	1
dinners	1
are	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
she	1
often	1
sees	1
such	1
at	1
home	1
The	1
person	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
speak	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
A	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
It	1
is	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Well	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
extremely	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
But	1
good	1
Lord	1
how	1
unlucky	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
fish	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
to	1
day	1
Lydia	1
my	1
love	1
ring	1
the	1
bell	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
Hill	1
this	1
moment	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
said	1
her	1
husband	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
person	1
whom	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
This	1
roused	1
a	1
general	1
astonishment	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
eagerly	1
questioned	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
five	1
daughters	1
at	1
once	1
After	1
amusing	1
himself	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
their	1
curiosity	1
he	1
thus	1
explained	1
About	1
a	1
month	1
ago	1
I	1
received	1
this	1
letter	1
and	1
about	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
I	1
answered	1
it	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
some	1
delicacy	1
and	1
requiring	1
early	1
attention	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
my	1
cousin	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
who	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
dead	1
may	1
turn	1
you	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
pleases	1
Oh	1
my	1
dear	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
mentioned	1
Pray	1
do	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
odious	1
man	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
hardest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
your	1
estate	1
should	1
be	1
entailed	1
away	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
tried	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
about	1
it	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
an	1
entail	1
They	1
had	1
often	1
attempted	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
before	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
on	1
which	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
rail	1
bitterly	1
against	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
settling	1
an	1
estate	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
five	1
daughters	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
nobody	1
cared	1
anything	1
about	1
It	1
certainly	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
iniquitous	1
affair	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
and	1
nothing	1
can	1
clear	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
from	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
inheriting	1
Longbourn	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
letter	1
you	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
softened	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
expressing	1
himself	1
No	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
impertinent	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
very	1
hypocritical	1
I	1
hate	1
such	1
false	1
friends	1
Why	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
keep	1
on	1
quarreling	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
before	1
him	1
Why	1
indeed	1
he	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
filial	1
scruples	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
Hunsford	1
near	1
Westerham	1
Kent	1
15th	1
October	1
Dear	1
Sir	1
The	1
disagreement	1
subsisting	1
between	1
yourself	1
and	1
my	1
late	1
honoured	1
father	1
always	1
gave	1
me	1
much	1
uneasiness	1
and	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
lose	1
him	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
wished	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
breach	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
doubts	1
fearing	1
lest	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
disrespectful	1
to	1
his	1
memory	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
anyone	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
pleased	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
variance	1
There	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
My	1
mind	1
however	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
for	1
having	1
received	1
ordination	1
at	1
Easter	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
patronage	1
of	1
the	1
Right	1
Honourable	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
widow	1
of	1
Sir	1
Lewis	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
whose	1
bounty	1
and	1
beneficence	1
has	1
preferred	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
valuable	1
rectory	1
of	1
this	1
parish	1
where	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
earnest	1
endeavour	1
to	1
demean	1
myself	1
with	1
grateful	1
respect	1
towards	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
be	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
perform	1
those	1
rites	1
and	1
ceremonies	1
which	1
are	1
instituted	1
by	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
England	1
As	1
a	1
clergyman	1
moreover	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
promote	1
and	1
establish	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
families	1
within	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
my	1
influence	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
grounds	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
that	1
my	1
present	1
overtures	1
are	1
highly	1
commendable	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
next	1
in	1
the	1
entail	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
will	1
be	1
kindly	1
overlooked	1
on	1
your	1
side	1
and	1
not	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
offered	1
olive	1
branch	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
concerned	1
at	1
being	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
injuring	1
your	1
amiable	1
daughters	1
and	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
readiness	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
every	1
possible	1
amends	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
hereafter	1
If	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
your	1
house	1
I	1
propose	1
myself	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
family	1
Monday	1
November	1
18th	1
by	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
shall	1
probably	1
trespass	1
on	1
your	1
hospitality	1
till	1
the	1
Saturday	1
se	1
ennight	1
following	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
as	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
objecting	1
to	1
my	1
occasional	1
absence	1
on	1
a	1
Sunday	1
provided	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
clergyman	1
is	1
engaged	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
remain	1
dear	1
sir	1
with	1
respectful	1
compliments	1
to	1
your	1
lady	1
and	1
daughters	1
your	1
well	1
wisher	1
and	1
friend	1
WILLIAM	1
COLLINS	1
At	1
four	1
o	1
clock	1
therefore	1
we	1
may	1
expect	1
this	1
peace	1
making	1
gentleman	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
as	1
he	1
folded	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
conscientious	1
and	1
polite	1
young	1
man	1
upon	1
my	1
word	1
and	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
will	1
prove	1
a	1
valuable	1
acquaintance	1
especially	1
if	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
indulgent	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
again	1
There	1
is	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
the	1
girls	1
however	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
any	1
amends	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
discourage	1
him	1
Though	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
said	1
Jane	1
to	1
guess	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
he	1
can	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
the	1
atonement	1
he	1
thinks	1
our	1
due	1
the	1
wish	1
is	1
certainly	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
chiefly	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
deference	1
for	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
his	1
kind	1
intention	1
of	1
christening	1
marrying	1
and	1
burying	1
his	1
parishioners	1
whenever	1
it	1
were	1
required	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
oddity	1
I	1
think	1
said	1
she	1
I	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
out	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
pompous	1
in	1
his	1
style	1
And	1
what	1
can	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
apologising	1
for	1
being	1
next	1
in	1
the	1
entail	1
We	1
cannot	1
suppose	1
he	1
would	1
help	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
Could	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
sir	1
No	1
my	1
dear	1
I	1
think	1
not	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
hopes	1
of	1
finding	1
him	1
quite	1
the	1
reverse	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
servility	1
and	1
self	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
letter	1
which	1
promises	1
well	1
I	1
am	1
impatient	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
In	1
point	1
of	1
composition	1
said	1
Mary	1
the	1
letter	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
defective	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
branch	1
perhaps	1
is	1
not	1
wholly	1
new	1
yet	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
expressed	1
To	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
neither	1
the	1
letter	1
nor	1
its	1
writer	1
were	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
interesting	1
It	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
impossible	1
that	1
their	1
cousin	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coat	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
some	1
weeks	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
colour	1
As	1
for	1
their	1
mother	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
letter	1
had	1
done	1
away	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
ill	1
will	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
composure	1
which	1
astonished	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
daughters	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
punctual	1
to	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
indeed	1
said	1
little	1
but	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
talk	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
seemed	1
neither	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
encouragement	1
nor	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
himself	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
heavy	1
looking	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
His	1
air	1
was	1
grave	1
and	1
stately	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
formal	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
seated	1
before	1
he	1
complimented	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
on	1
having	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
daughters	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
beauty	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
fame	1
had	1
fallen	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
her	1
seeing	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
disposed	1
of	1
in	1
marriage	1
This	1
gallantry	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
hearers	1
but	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
who	1
quarreled	1
with	1
no	1
compliments	1
answered	1
most	1
readily	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
kind	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
so	1
for	1
else	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
destitute	1
enough	1
Things	1
are	1
settled	1
so	1
oddly	1
You	1
allude	1
perhaps	1
to	1
the	1
entail	1
of	1
this	1
estate	1
Ah	1
sir	1
I	1
do	1
indeed	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
grievous	1
affair	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
girls	1
you	1
must	1
confess	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
I	1
know	1
are	1
all	1
chance	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
knowing	1
how	1
estates	1
will	1
go	1
when	1
once	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
entailed	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sensible	1
madam	1
of	1
the	1
hardship	1
to	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
and	1
could	1
say	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
cautious	1
of	1
appearing	1
forward	1
and	1
precipitate	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
that	1
I	1
come	1
prepared	1
to	1
admire	1
them	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
but	1
perhaps	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
better	1
acquainted	1
He	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
summons	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
smiled	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
admiration	1
The	1
hall	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
furniture	1
were	1
examined	1
and	1
praised	1
and	1
his	1
commendation	1
of	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
touched	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
heart	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
mortifying	1
supposition	1
of	1
his	1
viewing	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
future	1
property	1
The	1
dinner	1
too	1
in	1
its	1
turn	1
was	1
highly	1
admired	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
its	1
cooking	1
was	1
owing	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
right	1
there	1
by	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
who	1
assured	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
asperity	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
good	1
cook	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
daughters	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
He	1
begged	1
pardon	1
for	1
having	1
displeased	1
her	1
In	1
a	1
softened	1
tone	1
she	1
declared	1
herself	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
offended	1
but	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
Chapter	1
14	1
During	1
dinner	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
at	1
all	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
withdrawn	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
guest	1
and	1
therefore	1
started	1
a	1
subject	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
shine	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
very	1
fortunate	1
in	1
his	1
patroness	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
s	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
wishes	1
and	1
consideration	1
for	1
his	1
comfort	1
appeared	1
very	1
remarkable	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
chosen	1
better	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
eloquent	1
in	1
her	1
praise	1
The	1
subject	1
elevated	1
him	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
solemnity	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
aspect	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
witnessed	1
such	1
behaviour	1
in	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
rank	1
such	1
affability	1
and	1
condescension	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
experienced	1
from	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
graciously	1
pleased	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
discourses	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
preaching	1
before	1
her	1
She	1
had	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
twice	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Rosings	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
Saturday	1
before	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
pool	1
of	1
quadrille	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
reckoned	1
proud	1
by	1
many	1
people	1
he	1
knew	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
but	1
affability	1
in	1
her	1
She	1
had	1
always	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
gentleman	1
she	1
made	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
to	1
his	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
nor	1
to	1
his	1
leaving	1
the	1
parish	1
occasionally	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
relations	1
She	1
had	1
even	1
condescended	1
to	1
advise	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
provided	1
he	1
chose	1
with	1
discretion	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
paid	1
him	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
his	1
humble	1
parsonage	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
perfectly	1
approved	1
all	1
the	1
alterations	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
vouchsafed	1
to	1
suggest	1
some	1
herself	1
some	1
shelves	1
in	1
the	1
closet	1
up	1
stairs	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
proper	1
and	1
civil	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
woman	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
great	1
ladies	1
in	1
general	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
like	1
her	1
Does	1
she	1
live	1
near	1
you	1
sir	1
The	1
garden	1
in	1
which	1
stands	1
my	1
humble	1
abode	1
is	1
separated	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
lane	1
from	1
Rosings	1
Park	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
residence	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
sir	1
Has	1
she	1
any	1
family	1
She	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
daughter	1
the	1
heiress	1
of	1
Rosings	1
and	1
of	1
very	1
extensive	1
property	1
Ah	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
shaking	1
her	1
head	1
then	1
she	1
is	1
better	1
off	1
than	1
many	1
girls	1
And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
young	1
lady	1
is	1
she	1
Is	1
she	1
handsome	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
charming	1
young	1
lady	1
indeed	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
herself	1
says	1
that	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
true	1
beauty	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
is	1
far	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
handsomest	1
of	1
her	1
sex	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
features	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
distinguished	1
birth	1
She	1
is	1
unfortunately	1
of	1
a	1
sickly	1
constitution	1
which	1
has	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
making	1
that	1
progress	1
in	1
many	1
accomplishments	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
otherwise	1
failed	1
of	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
informed	1
by	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
superintended	1
her	1
education	1
and	1
who	1
still	1
resides	1
with	1
them	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
perfectly	1
amiable	1
and	1
often	1
condescends	1
to	1
drive	1
by	1
my	1
humble	1
abode	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
phaeton	1
and	1
ponies	1
Has	1
she	1
been	1
presented	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
her	1
name	1
among	1
the	1
ladies	1
at	1
court	1
Her	1
indifferent	1
state	1
of	1
health	1
unhappily	1
prevents	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
means	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
one	1
day	1
has	1
deprived	1
the	1
British	1
court	1
of	1
its	1
brightest	1
ornament	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
on	1
every	1
occasion	1
to	1
offer	1
those	1
little	1
delicate	1
compliments	1
which	1
are	1
always	1
acceptable	1
to	1
ladies	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
observed	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
that	1
her	1
charming	1
daughter	1
seemed	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
duchess	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
elevated	1
rank	1
instead	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
consequence	1
would	1
be	1
adorned	1
by	1
her	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
little	1
things	1
which	1
please	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
attention	1
which	1
I	1
conceive	1
myself	1
peculiarly	1
bound	1
to	1
pay	1
You	1
judge	1
very	1
properly	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
happy	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
possess	1
the	1
talent	1
of	1
flattering	1
with	1
delicacy	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
whether	1
these	1
pleasing	1
attentions	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
or	1
are	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
previous	1
study	1
They	1
arise	1
chiefly	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
passing	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
sometimes	1
amuse	1
myself	1
with	1
suggesting	1
and	1
arranging	1
such	1
little	1
elegant	1
compliments	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
adapted	1
to	1
ordinary	1
occasions	1
I	1
always	1
wish	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
as	1
unstudied	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
s	1
expectations	1
were	1
fully	1
answered	1
His	1
cousin	1
was	1
as	1
absurd	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
keenest	1
enjoyment	1
maintaining	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
composure	1
of	1
countenance	1
and	1
except	1
in	1
an	1
occasional	1
glance	1
at	1
Elizabeth	1
requiring	1
no	1
partner	1
in	1
his	1
pleasure	1
By	1
tea	1
time	1
however	1
the	1
dose	1
had	1
been	1
enough	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
guest	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
again	1
and	1
when	1
tea	1
was	1
over	1
glad	1
to	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
aloud	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
readily	1
assented	1
and	1
a	1
book	1
was	1
produced	1
but	1
on	1
beholding	1
it	1
for	1
everything	1
announced	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
a	1
circulating	1
library	1
he	1
started	1
back	1
and	1
begging	1
pardon	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
read	1
novels	1
Kitty	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
Lydia	1
exclaimed	1
Other	1
books	1
were	1
produced	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
deliberation	1
he	1
chose	1
Fordyce	1
s	1
Sermons	1
Lydia	1
gaped	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
volume	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
very	1
monotonous	1
solemnity	1
read	1
three	1
pages	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
with	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
mamma	1
that	1
my	1
uncle	1
Phillips	1
talks	1
of	1
turning	1
away	1
Richard	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
will	1
hire	1
him	1
My	1
aunt	1
told	1
me	1
so	1
herself	1
on	1
Saturday	1
I	1
shall	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton	1
to	1
morrow	1
to	1
hear	1
more	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
when	1
Mr	1
Denny	1
comes	1
back	1
from	1
town	1
Lydia	1
was	1
bid	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
eldest	1
sisters	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
tongue	1
but	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
much	1
offended	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
said	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
observed	1
how	1
little	1
young	1
ladies	1
are	1
interested	1
by	1
books	1
of	1
a	1
serious	1
stamp	1
though	1
written	1
solely	1
for	1
their	1
benefit	1
It	1
amazes	1
me	1
I	1
confess	1
for	1
certainly	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
so	1
advantageous	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
instruction	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
importune	1
my	1
young	1
cousin	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
he	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
antagonist	1
at	1
backgammon	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
accepted	1
the	1
challenge	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
acted	1
very	1
wisely	1
in	1
leaving	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
trifling	1
amusements	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
apologised	1
most	1
civilly	1
for	1
Lydia	1
s	1
interruption	1
and	1
promised	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
occur	1
again	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
resume	1
his	1
book	1
but	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
after	1
assuring	1
them	1

Chapter	1
15	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
deficiency	1
of	1
nature	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
little	1
assisted	1
by	1
education	1
or	1
society	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
having	1
been	1
spent	1
under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
an	1
illiterate	1
and	1
miserly	1
father	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
universities	1
he	1
had	1
merely	1
kept	1
the	1
necessary	1
terms	1
without	1
forming	1
at	1
it	1
any	1
useful	1
acquaintance	1
The	1
subjection	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
originally	1
great	1
humility	1
of	1
manner	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
counteracted	1
by	1
the	1
self	1
conceit	1
of	1
a	1
weak	1
head	1
living	1
in	1
retirement	1
and	1
the	1
consequential	1
feelings	1
of	1
early	1
and	1
unexpected	1
prosperity	1
A	1
fortunate	1
chance	1
had	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
was	1
vacant	1
and	1
the	1
respect	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
his	1
veneration	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
patroness	1
mingling	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
authority	1
as	1
a	1
clergyman	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
as	1
a	1
rector	1
made	1
him	1
altogether	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
obsequiousness	1
self	1
importance	1
and	1
humility	1
Having	1
now	1
a	1
good	1
house	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
sufficient	1
income	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
marry	1
and	1
in	1
seeking	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
in	1
view	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
choose	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
as	1
handsome	1
and	1
amiable	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
represented	1
by	1
common	1
report	1
This	1
was	1
his	1
plan	1
of	1
amends	1
of	1
atonement	1
for	1
inheriting	1
their	1
father	1
s	1
estate	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
an	1
excellent	1
one	1
full	1
of	1
eligibility	1
and	1
suitableness	1
and	1
excessively	1
generous	1
and	1
disinterested	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
His	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
vary	1
on	1
seeing	1
them	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
s	1
lovely	1
face	1
confirmed	1
his	1
views	1
and	1
established	1
all	1
his	1
strictest	1
notions	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
seniority	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
evening	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
settled	1
choice	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
however	1
made	1
an	1
alteration	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
s	1
t^ete	1
`a	1
t^ete	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
before	1
breakfast	1
a	1
conversation	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
parsonage	1
house	1
and	1
leading	1
naturally	1
to	1
the	1
avowal	1
of	1
his	1
hopes	1
that	1
a	1
mistress	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
produced	1
from	1
her	1
amid	1
very	1
complaisant	1
smiles	1
and	1
general	1
encouragement	1
a	1
caution	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
Jane	1
he	1
had	1
fixed	1
on	1
As	1
to	1
her	1
younger	1
daughters	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
upon	1
her	1
to	1
say	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
positively	1
answer	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
any	1
prepossession	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
she	1
must	1
just	1
mention	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
hint	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
soon	1
engaged	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
change	1
from	1
Jane	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
done	1
done	1
while	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
stirring	1
the	1
fire	1
Elizabeth	1
equally	1
next	1
to	1
Jane	1
in	1
birth	1
and	1
beauty	1
succeeded	1
her	1
of	1
course	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
treasured	1
up	1
the	1
hint	1
and	1
trusted	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
soon	1
have	1
two	1
daughters	1
married	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
was	1
now	1
high	1
in	1
her	1
good	1
graces	1
Lydia	1
s	1
intention	1
of	1
walking	1
to	1
Meryton	1
was	1
not	1
forgotten	1
every	1
sister	1
except	1
Mary	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
to	1
attend	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
who	1
was	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
have	1
his	1
library	1
to	1
himself	1
for	1
thither	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
would	1
continue	1
nominally	1
engaged	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
folios	1
in	1
the	1
collection	1
but	1
really	1
talking	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
with	1
little	1
cessation	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
at	1
Hunsford	1
Such	1
doings	1
discomposed	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
exceedingly	1
In	1
his	1
library	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
sure	1
of	1
leisure	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
though	1
prepared	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
folly	1
and	1
conceit	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
them	1
there	1
his	1
civility	1
therefore	1
was	1
most	1
prompt	1
in	1
inviting	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
daughters	1
in	1
their	1
walk	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
being	1
in	1
fact	1
much	1
better	1
fitted	1
for	1
a	1
walker	1
than	1
a	1
reader	1
was	1
extremely	1
pleased	1
to	1
close	1
his	1
large	1
book	1
and	1
go	1
In	1
pompous	1
nothings	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
civil	1
assents	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
cousins	1
their	1
time	1
passed	1
till	1
they	1
entered	1
Meryton	1
The	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
ones	1
was	1
then	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
him	1
Their	1
eyes	1
were	1
immediately	1
wandering	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
very	1
smart	1
bonnet	1
indeed	1
or	1
a	1
really	1
new	1
muslin	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
window	1
could	1
recall	1
them	1
But	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
every	1
lady	1
was	1
soon	1
caught	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
of	1
most	1
gentlemanlike	1
appearance	1
walking	1
with	1
another	1
officer	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
The	1
officer	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
Mr	1
Denny	1
concerning	1
whose	1
return	1
from	1
London	1
Lydia	1
came	1
to	1
inquire	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
All	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
stranger	1
s	1
air	1
all	1
wondered	1
who	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
and	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
determined	1
if	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
street	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
wanting	1
something	1
in	1
an	1
opposite	1
shop	1
and	1
fortunately	1
had	1
just	1
gained	1
the	1
pavement	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
turning	1
back	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
Mr	1
Denny	1
addressed	1
them	1
directly	1
and	1
entreated	1
permission	1
to	1
introduce	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
who	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
from	1
town	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
say	1
had	1
accepted	1
a	1
commission	1
in	1
their	1
corps	1
This	1
was	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
wanted	1
only	1
regimentals	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
completely	1
charming	1
His	1
appearance	1
was	1
greatly	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
beauty	1
a	1
fine	1
countenance	1
a	1
good	1
figure	1
and	1
very	1
pleasing	1
address	1
The	1
introduction	1
was	1
followed	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
readiness	1
of	1
conversation	1
a	1
readiness	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
perfectly	1
correct	1
and	1
unassuming	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
were	1
still	1
standing	1
and	1
talking	1
together	1
very	1
agreeably	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
horses	1
drew	1
their	1
notice	1
and	1
Darcy	1
and	1
Bingley	1
were	1
seen	1
riding	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
On	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
group	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
came	1
directly	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
began	1
the	1
usual	1
civilities	1
Bingley	1
was	1
the	1
principal	1
spokesman	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
the	1
principal	1
object	1
He	1
was	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
her	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
corroborated	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
determine	1
not	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Elizabeth	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
suddenly	1
arrested	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
happening	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
both	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
was	1
all	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
Both	1
changed	1
colour	1
one	1
looked	1
white	1
the	1
other	1
red	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
touched	1
his	1
hat	1
a	1
salutation	1
which	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
just	1
deigned	1
to	1
return	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
long	1
to	1
know	1
In	1
another	1
minute	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
but	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
have	1
noticed	1
what	1
passed	1
took	1
leave	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Denny	1
and	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
walked	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
Mr	1
Phillip	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
their	1
bows	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Miss	1
Lydia	1
s	1
pressing	1
entreaties	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
s	1
throwing	1
up	1
the	1
parlour	1
window	1
and	1
loudly	1
seconding	1
the	1
invitation	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
was	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
nieces	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
from	1
their	1
recent	1
absence	1
were	1
particularly	1
welcome	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
expressing	1
her	1
surprise	1
at	1
their	1
sudden	1
return	1
home	1
which	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
carriage	1
had	1
not	1
fetched	1
them	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
nothing	1
about	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
Mr	1
Jones	1
s	1
shop	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
who	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
any	1
more	1
draughts	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
because	1
the	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
were	1
come	1
away	1
when	1
her	1
civility	1
was	1
claimed	1
towards	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
by	1
Jane	1
s	1
introduction	1
of	1
him	1
She	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
very	1
best	1
politeness	1
which	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
more	1
apologising	1
for	1
his	1
intrusion	1
without	1
any	1
previous	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
her	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
flattering	1
himself	1
however	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
relationship	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
notice	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
was	1
quite	1
awed	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
excess	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
but	1
her	1
contemplation	1
of	1
one	1
stranger	1
was	1
soon	1
put	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
by	1
exclamations	1
and	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
whom	1
however	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
tell	1
her	1
nieces	1
what	1
they	1
already	1
knew	1
that	1
Mr	1
Denny	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
from	1
London	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
lieutenant	1
s	1
commission	1
in	1
the	1
shire	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
him	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
had	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
appeared	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
continued	1
the	1
occupation	1
but	1
unluckily	1
no	1
one	1
passed	1
windows	1
now	1
except	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
stranger	1
were	1
become	1
stupid	1
disagreeable	1
fellows	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
Phillipses	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
their	1
aunt	1
promised	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
husband	1
call	1
on	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
invitation	1
also	1
if	1
the	1
family	1
from	1
Longbourn	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
This	1
was	1
agreed	1
to	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
protested	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
nice	1
comfortable	1
noisy	1
game	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
hot	1
supper	1
afterwards	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
delights	1
was	1
very	1
cheering	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
in	1
mutual	1
good	1
spirits	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
repeated	1
his	1
apologies	1
in	1
quitting	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
was	1
assured	1
with	1
unwearying	1
civility	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
perfectly	1
needless	1
As	1
they	1
walked	1
home	1
Elizabeth	1
related	1
to	1
Jane	1
what	1
she	1

two	1
gentlemen	1
but	1
though	1
Jane	1
would	1
have	1
defended	1
either	1
or	1
both	1
had	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
explain	1
such	1
behaviour	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
highly	1
gratified	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
by	1
admiring	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
s	1
manners	1
and	1
politeness	1
He	1
protested	1
that	1
except	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
more	1
elegant	1
woman	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
civility	1
but	1
even	1
pointedly	1
included	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
evening	1
although	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
her	1
before	1
Something	1
he	1
supposed	1
might	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
attention	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
Chapter	1

As	1
no	1
objection	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
s	1
engagement	1
with	1
their	1
aunt	1
and	1
all	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
scruples	1
of	1
leaving	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
evening	1
during	1
his	1
visit	1
were	1
most	1
steadily	1
resisted	1
the	1
coach	1
conveyed	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
five	1
cousins	1
at	1
a	1
suitable	1
hour	1
to	1
Meryton	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
that	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
had	1
accepted	1
their	1
uncle	1
s	1
invitation	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
When	1
this	1
information	1
was	1
given	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
taken	1
their	1
seats	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
look	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
admire	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
size	1
and	1
furniture	1
of	1
the	1
apartment	1
that	1
he	1
declared	1
he	1
might	1
almost	1
have	1
supposed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
summer	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
at	1
Rosings	1
a	1
comparison	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
convey	1
much	1
gratification	1
but	1
when	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
understood	1
from	1
him	1
what	1
Rosings	1
was	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
its	1
proprietor	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
chimney	1
piece	1
alone	1
had	1
cost	1
eight	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
compliment	1
and	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
resented	1
a	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
s	1
room	1
In	1
describing	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
mansion	1
with	1
occasional	1
digressions	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
humble	1
abode	1
and	1
the	1
improvements	1
it	1
was	1
receiving	1
he	1
was	1
happily	1
employed	1
until	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
joined	1
them	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
a	1
very	1
attentive	1
listener	1
whose	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
consequence	1
increased	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
heard	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
resolving	1
to	1
retail	1
it	1
all	1
among	1
her	1
neighbours	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
To	1
the	1
girls	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
cousin	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
an	1
instrument	1
and	1
examine	1
their	1
own	1
indifferent	1
imitations	1
of	1
china	1
on	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
waiting	1
appeared	1
very	1
long	1
It	1
was	1
over	1
at	1
last	1
however	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
did	1
approach	1
and	1
when	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
neither	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
before	1
nor	1
thinking	1
of	1
him	1
since	1
with	1
the	1
smallest	1
degree	1
of	1
unreasonable	1
admiration	1
The	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
shire	1
were	1
in	1
general	1
a	1
very	1
creditable	1
gentlemanlike	1
set	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
party	1
but	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
was	1
as	1
far	1
beyond	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
person	1
countenance	1
air	1
and	1
walk	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
broad	1
faced	1
stuffy	1
uncle	1
Phillips	1
breathing	1
port	1
wine	1
who	1
followed	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
man	1
towards	1
whom	1
almost	1
every	1
female	1
eye	1
was	1
turned	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
woman	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
finally	1
seated	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
agreeable	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
immediately	1
fell	1
into	1
conversation	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
wet	1
night	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
commonest	1
dullest	1
most	1
threadbare	1
topic	1
might	1
be	1
rendered	1
interesting	1
by	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
the	1
speaker	1
With	1
such	1
rivals	1
for	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
as	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
seemed	1
to	1
sink	1
into	1
insignificance	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
he	1
certainly	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
at	1
intervals	1
a	1
kind	1
listener	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
and	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
watchfulness	1
most	1
abundantly	1
supplied	1
with	1
coffee	1
and	1
muffin	1
When	1
the	1
card	1
tables	1
were	1
placed	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
obliging	1
her	1
in	1
turn	1
by	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
whist	1
I	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
at	1
present	1
said	1
he	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
improve	1
myself	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
for	1
his	1
compliance	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
reason	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
did	1
not	1
play	1
at	1
whist	1
and	1
with	1
ready	1
delight	1
was	1
he	1
received	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
between	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Lydia	1
At	1
first	1
there	1
seemed	1
danger	1
of	1
Lydia	1
s	1
engrossing	1
him	1
entirely	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
determined	1
talker	1
but	1
being	1
likewise	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets	1
she	1
soon	1
grew	1
too	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
game	1
too	1
eager	1
in	1
making	1
bets	1
and	1
exclaiming	1
after	1
prizes	1
to	1
have	1
attention	1
for	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular	1
Allowing	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
demands	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
was	1
therefore	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
though	1
what	1
she	1
chiefly	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
She	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
mention	1
that	1
gentleman	1
Her	1
curiosity	1
however	1
was	1
unexpectedly	1
relieved	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
began	1
the	1
subject	1
himself	1
He	1
inquired	1
how	1
far	1
Netherfield	1
was	1
from	1
Meryton	1
and	1
after	1
receiving	1
her	1
answer	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
hesitating	1
manner	1
how	1
long	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
there	1
About	1
a	1
month	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
then	1
unwilling	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
subject	1
drop	1
added	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
large	1
property	1
in	1
Derbyshire	1
I	1
understand	1
Yes	1
replied	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
his	1
estate	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
noble	1
one	1
A	1
clear	1
ten	1
thousand	1
per	1
annum	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
more	1
capable	1
of	1
giving	1
you	1
certain	1
information	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
than	1
myself	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
manner	1
from	1
my	1
infancy	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
look	1
surprised	1
You	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
surprised	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
assertion	1
after	1
seeing	1
as	1
you	1
probably	1
might	1
the	1
very	1
cold	1
manner	1
of	1
our	1
meeting	1
yesterday	1
Are	1
you	1
much	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
As	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
ever	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
very	1
warmly	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
him	1
very	1
disagreeable	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
opinion	1
said	1
Wickham	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
agreeable	1
or	1
otherwise	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
qualified	1
to	1
form	1
one	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
too	1
long	1
and	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fair	1
judge	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
impartial	1
But	1
I	1
believe	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
in	1
general	1
astonish	1
and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
express	1
it	1
quite	1
so	1
strongly	1
anywhere	1
else	1
Here	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
family	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
here	1
than	1
I	1
might	1
say	1
in	1
any	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
except	1
Netherfield	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
liked	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
Everybody	1
is	1
disgusted	1
with	1
his	1
pride	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
more	1
favourably	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
anyone	1
I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
sorry	1
said	1
Wickham	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
interruption	1
that	1
he	1
or	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
estimated	1
beyond	1
their	1
deserts	1
but	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
happen	1
The	1
world	1
is	1
blinded	1
by	1
his	1
fortune	1
and	1
consequence	1
or	1
frightened	1
by	1
his	1
high	1
and	1
imposing	1
manners	1
and	1
sees	1
him	1
only	1
as	1
he	1
chooses	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
him	1
even	1
on	1
my	1
slight	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
ill	1
tempered	1
man	1
Wickham	1
only	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
I	1
wonder	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
much	1
longer	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
but	1
I	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
going	1
away	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
I	1
hope	1
your	1
plans	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
shire	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
Oh	1
no	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
away	1
by	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
If	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
me	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms	1
and	1
it	1
always	1
gives	1
me	1
pain	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
avoiding	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
might	1
proclaim	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
ill	1
usage	1
and	1
most	1
painful	1
regrets	1
at	1
his	1
being	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
His	1
father	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
the	1
late	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
men	1
that	1
ever	1
breathed	1
and	1
the	1
truest	1
friend	1
I	1
ever	1
had	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
this	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
without	1
being	1
grieved	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
tender	1
recollections	1
His	1
behaviour	1
to	1
myself	1
has	1
been	1
scandalous	1
but	1
I	1
verily	1
believe	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
him	1
anything	1
and	1
everything	1
rather	1
than	1
his	1
disappointing	1
the	1
hopes	1
and	1
disgracing	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
increase	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart	1
but	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
it	1
prevented	1
further	1
inquiry	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
on	1
more	1
general	1
topics	1
Meryton	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
the	1
society	1
appearing	1
highly	1
pleased	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
seen	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
gentle	1
but	1
very	1
intelligible	1
gallantry	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
constant	1
society	1
and	1
good	1
society	1
he	1
added	1
which	1
was	1
my	1
chief	1
inducement	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
shire	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
respectable	1
agreeable	1
corps	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
Denny	1
tempted	1
me	1
further	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
present	1
quarters	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
attentions	1
and	1
excellent	1
acquaintances	1
Meryton	1
had	1
procured	1
them	1
Society	1
I	1
own	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
disappointed	1
man	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
solitude	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
employment	1
and	1
society	1
A	1
military	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
intended	1
for	1
but	1
circumstances	1
have	1
now	1
made	1
it	1
eligible	1
The	1
church	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
profession	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
church	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
valuable	1
living	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
gentleman	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
just	1
now	1
Indeed	1
Yes	1
the	1
late	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
bequeathed	1
me	1
the	1
next	1
presentation	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
living	1
in	1
his	1
gift	1
He	1
was	1
my	1
godfather	1
and	1
excessively	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
kindness	1
He	1
meant	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
me	1
amply	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
fell	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
elsewhere	1
Good	1
heavens	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
but	1
how	1
could	1
that	1
be	1
How	1
could	1
his	1
will	1
be	1
disregarded	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
seek	1
legal	1
redress	1
There	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
an	1
informality	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
bequest	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
no	1
hope	1
from	1
law	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
doubted	1
the	1
intention	1
but	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
chose	1
to	1
doubt	1
it	1
or	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
merely	1
conditional	1
recommendation	1
and	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
forfeited	1
all	1
claim	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
extravagance	1
imprudence	1
in	1
short	1
anything	1
or	1
nothing	1
Certain	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
became	1
vacant	1
two	1
years	1
ago	1
exactly	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
age	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
another	1
man	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
certain	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
accuse	1
myself	1
of	1
having	1
really	1
done	1
anything	1
to	1
deserve	1
to	1
lose	1
it	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
warm	1
unguarded	1
temper	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
spoken	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
too	1
freely	1
I	1
can	1
recall	1
nothing	1
worse	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
hates	1
me	1
This	1
is	1
quite	1
shocking	1
He	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
publicly	1
disgraced	1
Some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
by	1
me	1
Till	1
I	1
can	1
forget	1
his	1
father	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
defy	1
or	1
expose	1
him	1
Elizabeth	1
honoured	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
feelings	1
and	1
thought	1
him	1
handsomer	1
than	1
ever	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
them	1
But	1
what	1
said	1
she	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
motive	1
What	1
can	1
have	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
behave	1
so	1
cruelly	1
A	1
thorough	1
determined	1
dislike	1
of	1
me	1
a	1
dislike	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
attribute	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
to	1
jealousy	1
Had	1
the	1
late	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
liked	1
me	1
less	1
his	1
son	1
might	1
have	1
borne	1
with	1
me	1
better	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
uncommon	1
attachment	1
to	1
me	1
irritated	1
him	1
I	1
believe	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
life	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
temper	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
competition	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
stood	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
preference	1
which	1
was	1
often	1
given	1
me	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
this	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
liked	1
him	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
so	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
had	1
supposed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
despising	1
his	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
in	1
general	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
suspect	1
him	1
of	1
descending	1
to	1
such	1
malicious	1
revenge	1
such	1
injustice	1
such	1
inhumanity	1
as	1
this	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
reflection	1
however	1
she	1
continued	1
I	1
do	1
remember	1
his	1
boasting	1
one	1
day	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
of	1
the	1
implacability	1
of	1
his	1
resentments	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
an	1
unforgiving	1
temper	1
His	1
disposition	1
must	1
be	1
dreadful	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
trust	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
replied	1
Wickham	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
just	1
to	1
him	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
again	1
deep	1
in	1
thought	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
exclaimed	1
To	1
treat	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
the	1
godson	1
the	1
friend	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
She	1
could	1
have	1
added	1
A	1
young	1
man	1
too	1
like	1
you	1
whose	1
very	1
countenance	1
may	1
vouch	1
for	1
your	1
being	1
amiable	1
but	1
she	1
contented	1
herself	1
with	1
and	1
one	1
too	1
who	1
had	1
probably	1
been	1
his	1
companion	1
from	1
childhood	1
connected	1
together	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
manner	1
We	1
were	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
parish	1
within	1
the	1
same	1
park	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
youth	1
was	1
passed	1
together	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
sharing	1
the	1
same	1
amusements	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
parental	1
care	1
My	1
father	1
began	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
profession	1
which	1
your	1
uncle	1
Mr	1
Phillips	1
appears	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
credit	1
to	1
but	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
the	1
late	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
and	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
Pemberley	1
property	1
He	1
was	1
most	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
by	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
a	1
most	1
intimate	1
confidential	1
friend	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
often	1
acknowledged	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
greatest	1
obligations	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
active	1
superintendence	1
and	1
when	1
immediately	1
before	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
death	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
voluntary	1
promise	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
debt	1
of	1
gratitude	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
to	1
myself	1
How	1
strange	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
How	1
abominable	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
pride	1
of	1
this	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
has	1
not	1
made	1
him	1
just	1
to	1
you	1
If	1
from	1
no	1
better	1
motive	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
dishonest	1
for	1
dishonesty	1
I	1
must	1
call	1
it	1
It	1
is	1
wonderful	1
replied	1
Wickham	1
for	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
actions	1
may	1
be	1
traced	1
to	1
pride	1
and	1
pride	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
his	1
best	1
friend	1
It	1
has	1
connected	1
him	1
nearer	1
with	1
virtue	1
than	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
feeling	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
consistent	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
there	1
were	1
stronger	1
impulses	1
even	1
than	1
pride	1
Can	1
such	1
abominable	1
pride	1
as	1
his	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
him	1
good	1
Yes	1
It	1
has	1
often	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
liberal	1
and	1
generous	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
money	1
freely	1
to	1
display	1
hospitality	1
to	1
assist	1
his	1
tenants	1
and	1
relieve	1
the	1
poor	1
Family	1
pride	1
and	1
filial	1
pride	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
Not	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
disgrace	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
degenerate	1
from	1
the	1
popular	1
qualities	1
or	1
lose	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
Pemberley	1
House	1
is	1
a	1
powerful	1
motive	1
He	1
has	1
also	1
brotherly	1
pride	1
which	1
with	1
some	1
brotherly	1
affection	1
makes	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
careful	1
guardian	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
generally	1
cried	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
attentive	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
brothers	1
What	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
He	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
call	1
her	1
amiable	1
It	1
gives	1
me	1
pain	1
to	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
Darcy	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
her	1
brother	1
very	1
very	1
proud	1
As	1
a	1
child	1
she	1
was	1
affectionate	1
and	1
pleasing	1
and	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
devoted	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
to	1
her	1
amusement	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
handsome	1
girl	1
about	1
fifteen	1
or	1
sixteen	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
highly	1
accomplished	1
Since	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
death	1
her	1
home	1
has	1
been	1
London	1
where	1
a	1
lady	1
lives	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
superintends	1
her	1
education	1
After	1
many	1
pauses	1
and	1
many	1
trials	1
of	1
other	1
subjects	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
reverting	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
saying	1
I	1
am	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
How	1
can	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
who	1
seems	1
good	1
humour	1
itself	1
and	1
is	1
I	1
really	1
believe	1
truly	1
amiable	1
be	1
in	1
friendship	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
How	1
can	1
they	1
suit	1
each	1
other	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
Not	1
at	1
all	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
tempered	1
amiable	1
charming	1
man	1
He	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
Probably	1
not	1
but	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
can	1
please	1
where	1
he	1
chooses	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
abilities	1
He	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
conversible	1
companion	1
if	1
he	1
thinks	1
it	1
worth	1
his	1
while	1
Among	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
equals	1
in	1
consequence	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
man	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
less	1
prosperous	1
His	1
pride	1
never	1
deserts	1
him	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
he	1
is	1
liberal	1
minded	1
just	1
sincere	1
rational	1
honourable	1
and	1
perhaps	1
agreeable	1
allowing	1
something	1
for	1
fortune	1
and	1
figure	1
The	1
whist	1
party	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
breaking	1
up	1
the	1
players	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
took	1
his	1
station	1
between	1
his	1
cousin	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
The	1
usual	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
success	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
latter	1
It	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
great	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
every	1
point	1
but	1
when	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
began	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
concern	1
thereupon	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
with	1
much	1
earnest	1
gravity	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
importance	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
money	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
trifle	1
and	1
begged	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
herself	1
uneasy	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
madam	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
when	1
persons	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
card	1
table	1
they	1
must	1
take	1
their	1
chances	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
happily	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
circumstances	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
five	1
shillings	1
any	1
object	1
There	1
are	1
undoubtedly	1
many	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
I	1
am	1
removed	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
regarding	1
little	1
matters	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
s	1
attention	1
was	1
caught	1
and	1
after	1
observing	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
asked	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
whether	1
her	1
relation	1
was	1
very	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
she	1
replied	1
has	1
very	1
lately	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
living	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
first	1
introduced	1
to	1
her	1
notice	1
but	1
he	1
certainly	1
has	1
not	1
known	1
her	1
long	1
You	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
and	1
Lady	1
Anne	1
Darcy	1
were	1
sisters	1
consequently	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
aunt	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
No	1
indeed	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
connections	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
Her	1
daughter	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
fortune	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
cousin	1
will	1
unite	1
the	1
two	1
estates	1
This	1
information	1
made	1
Elizabeth	1
smile	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
poor	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
Vain	1
indeed	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
her	1
attentions	1
vain	1
and	1
useless	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
himself	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
self	1
destined	1
for	1
another	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
said	1
she	1
speaks	1
highly	1
both	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
but	1
from	1
some	1
particulars	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
related	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
I	1
suspect	1
his	1
gratitude	1
misleads	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
his	1
patroness	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
arrogant	1
conceited	1
woman	1
I	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
both	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
replied	1
Wickham	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
but	1
I	1
very	1
well	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
liked	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
dictatorial	1
and	1
insolent	1
She	1
has	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
remarkably	1
sensible	1
and	1
clever	1
but	1
I	1
rather	1
believe	1
she	1
derives	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
abilities	1
from	1
her	1
rank	1
and	1
fortune	1
part	1
from	1
her	1
authoritative	1
manner	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
the	1
pride	1
for	1
her	1
nephew	1
who	1
chooses	1
that	1
everyone	1
connected	1
with	1
him	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class	1
Elizabeth	1
allowed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
very	1
rational	1
account	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
talking	1
together	1
with	1
mutual	1
satisfaction	1
till	1
supper	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
cards	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
s	1
attentions	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
s	1
supper	1
party	1
but	1
his	1
manners	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
everybody	1
Whatever	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
said	1
well	1
and	1
whatever	1
he	1
did	1
done	1
gracefully	1
Elizabeth	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
full	1
of	1
him	1
She	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
of	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
time	1
for	1
her	1
even	1
to	1
mention	1
his	1
name	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
for	1
neither	1
Lydia	1
nor	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
were	1
once	1
silent	1
Lydia	1
talked	1
incessantly	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
and	1
the	1
fish	1
she	1
had	1
won	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
in	1
describing	1
the	1
civility	1
of	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
protesting	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
regard	1
his	1
losses	1
at	1
whist	1
enumerating	1
all	1
the	1
dishes	1
at	1
supper	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
crowded	1
his	1
cousins	1
had	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
well	1
manage	1
before	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped	1
at	1
Longbourn	1

Chapter	1
17	1
Elizabeth	1
related	1
to	1
Jane	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
herself	1
Jane	1
listened	1
with	1
astonishment	1
and	1
concern	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
unworthy	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
nature	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
veracity	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
amiable	1
appearance	1
as	1
Wickham	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
endured	1
such	1
unkindness	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
interest	1
all	1
her	1
tender	1
feelings	1
and	1
nothing	1
remained	1
therefore	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
them	1
both	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
each	1
and	1
throw	1
into	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
accident	1
or	1
mistake	1
whatever	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise	1
explained	1
They	1
have	1
both	1
said	1
she	1
been	1
deceived	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
form	1
no	1
idea	1
Interested	1
people	1
have	1
perhaps	1
misrepresented	1
each	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
short	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
conjecture	1
the	1
causes	1
or	1
circumstances	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
alienated	1
them	1
without	1
actual	1
blame	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
Very	1
true	1
indeed	1
and	1
now	1
my	1
dear	1
Jane	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
interested	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
probably	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
Do	1
clear	1
them	1
too	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
somebody	1
Laugh	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
laugh	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
opinion	1
My	1
dearest	1
Lizzy	1
do	1
but	1
consider	1
in	1
what	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
light	1
it	1
places	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
to	1
be	1
treating	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
favourite	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
one	1
whom	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
No	1
man	1
of	1
common	1
humanity	1
no	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
value	1
for	1
his	1
character	1
could	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
it	1
Can	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends	1
be	1
so	1
excessively	1
deceived	1
in	1
him	1
Oh	1
no	1
I	1
can	1
much	1
more	1
easily	1
believe	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
being	1
imposed	1
on	1
than	1
that	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
should	1
invent	1
such	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
last	1
night	1
names	1
facts	1
everything	1
mentioned	1
without	1
ceremony	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
so	1
let	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
contradict	1
it	1
Besides	1
there	1
was	1
truth	1
in	1
his	1
looks	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
indeed	1
it	1
is	1
distressing	1
One	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
one	1
knows	1
exactly	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
But	1
Jane	1
could	1
think	1
with	1
certainty	1
on	1
only	1
one	1
point	1
that	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
imposed	1
on	1
would	1
have	1
much	1
to	1
suffer	1
when	1
the	1
affair	1
became	1
public	1
The	1
two	1
young	1
ladies	1
were	1
summoned	1
from	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
where	1
this	1
conversation	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
persons	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
speaking	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
came	1
to	1
give	1
their	1
personal	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
expected	1
ball	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
which	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
following	1
Tuesday	1
The	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
dear	1
friend	1
again	1
called	1
it	1
an	1
age	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
with	1
herself	1
since	1
their	1
separation	1
To	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
they	1
paid	1
little	1
attention	1
avoiding	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
saying	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
They	1
were	1
soon	1
gone	1
again	1
rising	1
from	1
their	1
seats	1
with	1
an	1
activity	1
which	1
took	1
their	1
brother	1
by	1
surprise	1
and	1
hurrying	1
off	1
as	1
if	1
eager	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
civilities	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
ball	1
was	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
to	1
every	1
female	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
chose	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
given	1
in	1
compliment	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
and	1
was	1
particularly	1
flattered	1
by	1
receiving	1
the	1
invitation	1
from	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
himself	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
ceremonious	1
card	1
Jane	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
a	1
happy	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
friends	1
and	1
the	1
attentions	1
of	1
their	1
brother	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
thought	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
dancing	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
with	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
look	1
and	1
behaviour	1
The	1
happiness	1
anticipated	1
by	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
depended	1
less	1
on	1
any	1
single	1
event	1
or	1
any	1
particular	1
person	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
each	1
like	1
Elizabeth	1
meant	1
to	1
dance	1
half	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
only	1
partner	1
who	1
could	1
satisfy	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
was	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
a	1
ball	1
And	1
even	1
Mary	1
could	1
assure	1
her	1
family	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
disinclination	1
for	1
it	1
While	1
I	1
can	1
have	1
my	1
mornings	1
to	1
myself	1
said	1
she	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
join	1
occasionally	1
in	1
evening	1
engagements	1
Society	1
has	1
claims	1
on	1
us	1
all	1
and	1
I	1
profess	1
myself	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
consider	1
intervals	1
of	1
recreation	1
and	1
amusement	1
as	1
desirable	1
for	1
everybody	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
spirits	1
were	1
so	1
high	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
often	1
speak	1
unnecessarily	1
to	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
asking	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accept	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
invitation	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
s	1
amusement	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
rather	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
entertained	1
no	1
scruple	1
whatever	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
dreading	1
a	1
rebuke	1
either	1
from	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
or	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
by	1
venturing	1
to	1
dance	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
opinion	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
character	1
to	1
respectable	1
people	1
can	1
have	1
any	1
evil	1
tendency	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
objecting	1
to	1
dancing	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
honoured	1
with	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
I	1
take	1
this	1
opportunity	1
of	1
soliciting	1
yours	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
dances	1
especially	1
a	1
preference	1
which	1
I	1
trust	1
my	1
cousin	1
Jane	1
will	1
attribute	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
cause	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
disrespect	1
for	1
her	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
herself	1
completely	1
taken	1
in	1
She	1
had	1
fully	1
proposed	1
being	1
engaged	1
by	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
for	1
those	1
very	1
dances	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
instead	1
her	1
liveliness	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
worse	1
timed	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
however	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
were	1
perforce	1
delayed	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
proposal	1
accepted	1
with	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
grace	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
gallantry	1
from	1
the	1
idea	1
it	1
suggested	1
of	1
something	1
more	1
It	1
now	1
first	1
struck	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
selected	1
from	1
among	1
her	1
sisters	1
as	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
mistress	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
Parsonage	1
and	1
of	1
assisting	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
quadrille	1
table	1
at	1
Rosings	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
more	1
eligible	1
visitors	1
The	1
idea	1
soon	1
reached	1
to	1
conviction	1
as	1
she	1
observed	1
his	1
increasing	1
civilities	1
toward	1
herself	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
frequent	1
attempt	1
at	1
a	1
compliment	1
on	1
her	1
wit	1
and	1
vivacity	1
and	1
though	1
more	1
astonished	1
than	1
gratified	1
herself	1
by	1
this	1
effect	1
of	1
her	1
charms	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
her	1
mother	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
their	1
marriage	1
was	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
to	1
her	1
Elizabeth	1
however	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
hint	1
being	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
a	1
serious	1
dispute	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
any	1
reply	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
might	1
never	1
make	1
the	1
offer	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
quarrel	1
about	1
him	1
If	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
Netherfield	1
ball	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
pitiable	1
state	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ball	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
rain	1
as	1
prevented	1
their	1
walking	1
to	1
Meryton	1
once	1
No	1
aunt	1
no	1
officers	1
no	1
news	1
could	1
be	1
sought	1
after	1
the	1
very	1
shoe	1
roses	1
for	1
Netherfield	1
were	1
got	1
by	1
proxy	1
Even	1
Elizabeth	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
some	1
trial	1
of	1
her	1
patience	1
in	1
weather	1
which	1
totally	1
suspended	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
dance	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
Friday	1
Saturday	1
Sunday	1
and	1
Monday	1
endurable	1
to	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
Chapter	1
18	1
Till	1
Elizabeth	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
among	1
the	1
cluster	1
of	1
red	1
coats	1
there	1
assembled	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
present	1
had	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
certainty	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
checked	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
recollections	1
that	1
might	1
not	1
unreasonably	1
have	1
alarmed	1
her	1
She	1
had	1
dressed	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
care	1
and	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits	1
for	1
the	1
conquest	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
unsubdued	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
trusting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
might	1
be	1
won	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
But	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
arose	1
the	1
dreadful	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
purposely	1
omitted	1
for	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
the	1
case	1
the	1
absolute	1
fact	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
was	1
pronounced	1
by	1
his	1
friend	1
Denny	1
to	1
whom	1
Lydia	1
eagerly	1
applied	1
and	1
who	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
Wickham	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
town	1
on	1
business	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
returned	1
adding	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
smile	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
his	1
business	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
away	1
just	1
now	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
wanted	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
certain	1
gentleman	1
here	1
This	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence	1
though	1
unheard	1
by	1
Lydia	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
Darcy	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
answerable	1
for	1
Wickham	1
s	1
absence	1
than	1
if	1
her	1
first	1
surmise	1
had	1
been	1
just	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
displeasure	1
against	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
so	1
sharpened	1
by	1
immediate	1
disappointment	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
reply	1
with	1
tolerable	1
civility	1
to	1
the	1
polite	1
inquiries	1
which	1
he	1
directly	1
afterwards	1
approached	1
to	1
make	1
Attendance	1
forbearance	1
patience	1
with	1
Darcy	1
was	1
injury	1
to	1
Wickham	1
She	1
was	1
resolved	1
against	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
conversation	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
ill	1
humour	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wholly	1
surmount	1
even	1
in	1
speaking	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
whose	1
blind	1
partiality	1
provoked	1
her	1
But	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
not	1
formed	1
for	1
ill	1
humour	1
and	1
though	1
every	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
was	1
destroyed	1
for	1
the	1
evening	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
dwell	1
long	1
on	1
her	1
spirits	1
and	1
having	1
told	1
all	1
her	1
griefs	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
voluntary	1
transition	1
to	1
the	1
oddities	1
of	1
her	1
cousin	1
and	1
to	1
point	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
particular	1
notice	1
The	1
first	1
two	1
dances	1
however	1
brought	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
distress	1
they	1
were	1
dances	1
of	1
mortification	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
awkward	1
and	1
solemn	1
apologising	1
instead	1
of	1
attending	1
and	1
often	1
moving	1
wrong	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
misery	1
which	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
partner	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dances	1
can	1
give	1
The	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
release	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
ecstasy	1
She	1
danced	1
next	1
with	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
refreshment	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
Wickham	1
and	1
of	1
hearing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
universally	1
liked	1
When	1
those	1
dances	1
were	1
over	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
suddenly	1
addressed	1
by	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
who	1
took	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
surprise	1
in	1
his	1
application	1
for	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
she	1
accepted	1
him	1
He	1
walked	1
away	1
again	1
immediately	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
fret	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
want	1
of	1
presence	1
of	1
mind	1
Charlotte	1
tried	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
him	1
very	1
agreeable	1
Heaven	1
forbid	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
misfortune	1
of	1
all	1
To	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
agreeable	1
whom	1
one	1
is	1
determined	1
to	1
hate	1
Do	1
not	1
wish	1
me	1
such	1
an	1
evil	1
When	1
the	1
dancing	1
recommenced	1
however	1
and	1
Darcy	1
approached	1
to	1
claim	1
her	1
hand	1
Charlotte	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
cautioning	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
simpleton	1
and	1
allow	1
her	1
fancy	1
for	1
Wickham	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
appear	1
unpleasant	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
ten	1
times	1
his	1
consequence	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
set	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
dignity	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
arrived	1
in	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
stand	1
opposite	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
and	1
reading	1
in	1
her	1
neighbours	1
looks	1
their	1
equal	1
amazement	1
in	1
beholding	1
it	1
They	1
stood	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
silence	1
was	1
to	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
two	1
dances	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
till	1
suddenly	1
fancying	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greater	1
punishment	1
to	1
her	1
partner	1
to	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
talk	1
she	1
made	1
some	1
slight	1
observation	1
on	1
the	1
dance	1
He	1
replied	1
and	1
was	1
again	1
silent	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
some	1
minutes	1
she	1
addressed	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
with	1
It	1
is	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
now	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
I	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
dance	1
and	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
remark	1
on	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
couples	1
He	1
smiled	1
and	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
whatever	1
she	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
should	1
be	1
said	1
Very	1
well	1
That	1
reply	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
Perhaps	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
I	1
may	1
observe	1
that	1
private	1
balls	1
are	1
much	1
pleasanter	1
than	1
public	1
ones	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
silent	1
Do	1
you	1
talk	1
by	1
rule	1
then	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
dancing	1
Sometimes	1
One	1
must	1
speak	1
a	1
little	1
you	1
know	1
It	1
would	1
look	1
odd	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
silent	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
together	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
some	1
conversation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
arranged	1
as	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
saying	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
Are	1
you	1
consulting	1
your	1
own	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
gratifying	1
mine	1
Both	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
archly	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
similarity	1
in	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
our	1
minds	1
We	1
are	1
each	1
of	1
an	1
unsocial	1
taciturn	1
disposition	1
unwilling	1
to	1
speak	1
unless	1
we	1
expect	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
amaze	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
and	1
be	1
handed	1
down	1
to	1
posterity	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
'eclat	1
of	1
a	1
proverb	1
This	1
is	1
no	1
very	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
character	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
said	1
he	1
How	1
near	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
mine	1
I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
say	1
You	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
faithful	1
portrait	1
undoubtedly	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
decide	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
performance	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
silent	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
the	1
dance	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
did	1
not	1
very	1
often	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton	1
She	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation	1
added	1
When	1
you	1
met	1
us	1
there	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
forming	1
a	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
The	1
effect	1
was	1
immediate	1
A	1
deeper	1
shade	1
of	1
hauteur	1
overspread	1
his	1
features	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
though	1
blaming	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
weakness	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
At	1
length	1
Darcy	1
spoke	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
constrained	1
manner	1
said	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
is	1
blessed	1
with	1
such	1
happy	1
manners	1
as	1
may	1
ensure	1
his	1
making	1
friends	1
whether	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
equally	1
capable	1
of	1
retaining	1
them	1
is	1
less	1
certain	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
unlucky	1
as	1
to	1
lose	1
your	1
friendship	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
emphasis	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
Darcy	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
changing	1
the	1
subject	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
appeared	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
meaning	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
set	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
on	1
perceiving	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
he	1
stopped	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
of	1
superior	1
courtesy	1
to	1
compliment	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
dancing	1
and	1
his	1
partner	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
highly	1
gratified	1
indeed	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
Such	1
very	1
superior	1
dancing	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
seen	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
circles	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
however	1
that	1
your	1
fair	1
partner	1
does	1
not	1
disgrace	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
pleasure	1
often	1
repeated	1
especially	1
when	1
a	1
certain	1
desirable	1
event	1
my	1
dear	1
Eliza	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
Bingley	1
shall	1
take	1
place	1
What	1
congratulations	1
will	1
then	1
flow	1
in	1
I	1
appeal	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
interrupt	1
you	1
sir	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
thank	1
me	1
for	1
detaining	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
bewitching	1
converse	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
lady	1
whose	1
bright	1
eyes	1
are	1
also	1
upbraiding	1
me	1
The	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
address	1
was	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
by	1
Darcy	1
but	1
Sir	1
William	1
s	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
him	1
forcibly	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
directed	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
expression	1
towards	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
who	1
were	1
dancing	1
together	1
Recovering	1
himself	1
however	1
shortly	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
partner	1
and	1
said	1
Sir	1
William	1
s	1
interruption	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
forget	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
at	1
all	1
Sir	1
William	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
interrupted	1
two	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
who	1
had	1
less	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
themselves	1
We	1
have	1
tried	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
subjects	1
already	1
without	1
success	1
and	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
next	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
What	1
think	1
you	1
of	1
books	1
said	1
he	1
smiling	1
Books	1
oh	1
no	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
never	1
read	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
but	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
there	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
subject	1
We	1
may	1
compare	1
our	1
different	1
opinions	1
No	1
I	1
cannot	1
talk	1
of	1
books	1
in	1
a	1
ball	1
room	1
my	1
head	1
is	1
always	1
full	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
The	1
present	1
always	1
occupies	1
you	1
in	1
such	1
scenes	1
does	1
it	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
doubt	1
Yes	1
always	1
she	1
replied	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
for	1
her	1
thoughts	1
had	1
wandered	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
appeared	1
by	1
her	1
suddenly	1
exclaiming	1
I	1
remember	1
hearing	1
you	1
once	1
say	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
that	1
you	1
hardly	1
ever	1
forgave	1
that	1
your	1
resentment	1
once	1
created	1
was	1
unappeasable	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
cautious	1
I	1
suppose	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
being	1
created	1
	1
I	1
am	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
voice	1
And	1
never	1
allow	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
blinded	1
by	1
prejudice	1
I	1
hope	1
not	1
It	1
is	1
particularly	1
incumbent	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
never	1
change	1
their	1
opinion	1
to	1
be	1
secure	1
of	1
judging	1
properly	1
at	1
first	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
questions	1
tend	1
Merely	1
to	1
the	1
illustration	1
of	1
your	1
character	1
said	1
she	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
her	1
gravity	1
I	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
success	1
She	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
get	1
on	1
at	1
all	1
I	1
hear	1
such	1
different	1
accounts	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
puzzle	1
me	1
exceedingly	1
I	1
can	1
readily	1
believe	1
answered	1
he	1
gravely	1
that	1
reports	1
may	1
vary	1
greatly	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
sketch	1
my	1
character	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
performance	1
would	1
reflect	1
no	1
credit	1
on	1
either	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
your	1
likeness	1
now	1
I	1
may	1
never	1
have	1
another	1
opportunity	1
I	1
would	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
suspend	1
any	1
pleasure	1
of	1
yours	1
he	1
coldly	1
replied	1
She	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
dance	1
and	1
parted	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
dissatisfied	1
though	1
not	1
to	1
an	1
equal	1
degree	1
for	1
in	1
Darcy	1
s	1
breast	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tolerably	1
powerful	1
feeling	1
towards	1
her	1
which	1
soon	1
procured	1
her	1
pardon	1
and	1
directed	1
all	1
his	1
anger	1
against	1
another	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
separated	1
when	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
came	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
civil	1
disdain	1
accosted	1
her	1
So	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
I	1
hear	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
George	1
Wickham	1
Your	1
sister	1
has	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
asking	1
me	1
a	1
thousand	1
questions	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
quite	1
forgot	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
among	1
his	1
other	1
communication	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
old	1
Wickham	1
the	1
late	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
steward	1
Let	1
me	1
recommend	1
you	1
however	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
implicit	1
confidence	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
assertions	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
using	1
him	1
ill	1
it	1
is	1
perfectly	1
false	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
remarkably	1
kind	1
to	1
him	1
though	1
George	1
Wickham	1
has	1
treated	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
infamous	1
manner	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
particulars	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
George	1
Wickham	1
mentioned	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
my	1
brother	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
avoid	1
including	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
he	1
was	1
excessively	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
His	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
all	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
insolent	1
thing	1
indeed	1
and	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
presume	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
I	1
pity	1
you	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
for	1
this	1
discovery	1
of	1
your	1
favourite	1
s	1
guilt	1
but	1
really	1
considering	1
his	1
descent	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
expect	1
much	1
better	1
His	1
guilt	1
and	1
his	1
descent	1
appear	1
by	1
your	1
account	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
angrily	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
accuse	1
him	1
of	1
nothing	1
worse	1
than	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
steward	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
he	1
informed	1
me	1
himself	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
replied	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
turning	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
sneer	1
Excuse	1
my	1
interference	1
it	1
was	1
kindly	1
meant	1
Insolent	1
girl	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
herself	1
You	1
are	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
influence	1
me	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
paltry	1
attack	1
as	1
this	1
I	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
your	1
own	1
wilful	1
ignorance	1
and	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
She	1
then	1
sought	1
her	1
eldest	1
sister	1
who	1
had	1
undertaken	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
of	1
Bingley	1
Jane	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
such	1
sweet	1
complacency	1
a	1
glow	1
of	1
such	1
happy	1
expression	1
as	1
sufficiently	1
marked	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
Elizabeth	1
instantly	1
read	1
her	1
feelings	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
solicitude	1
for	1
Wickham	1
resentment	1
against	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
everything	1
else	1
gave	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Jane	1
s	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
fairest	1
way	1
for	1
happiness	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
no	1
less	1
smiling	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
learnt	1
about	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
But	1
perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
pleasantly	1
engaged	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
third	1
person	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
my	1
pardon	1
No	1
replied	1
Jane	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
forgotten	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
history	1
and	1
is	1
quite	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
have	1
principally	1
offended	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
vouch	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
conduct	1
the	1
probity	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
that	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
has	1
deserved	1
much	1
less	1
attention	1
from	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
than	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
respectable	1
young	1
man	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
imprudent	1
and	1
has	1
deserved	1
to	1
lose	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
regard	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
himself	1
No	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
him	1
till	1
the	1
other	1
morning	1
at	1
Meryton	1
This	1
account	1
then	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
from	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
But	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
exactly	1
recollect	1
the	1
circumstances	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
heard	1
them	1
from	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
but	1
he	1
believes	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
him	1
conditionally	1
only	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
sincerity	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
warmly	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
my	1
not	1
being	1
convinced	1
by	1
assurances	1
only	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
able	1
one	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
but	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
several	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
and	1
has	1
learnt	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
that	1
friend	1
himself	1
I	1
shall	1
venture	1
to	1
still	1
think	1
of	1
both	1
gentlemen	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
before	1
She	1
then	1
changed	1
the	1
discourse	1
to	1
one	1
more	1
gratifying	1
to	1
each	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
of	1
sentiment	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
with	1
delight	1
to	1
the	1
happy	1
though	1
modest	1
hopes	1
which	1
Jane	1
entertained	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
and	1
said	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
heighten	1
her	1
confidence	1
in	1
it	1
On	1
their	1
being	1
joined	1
by	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
himself	1
Elizabeth	1
withdrew	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
to	1
whose	1
inquiry	1
after	1
the	1
pleasantness	1
of	1
her	1
last	1
partner	1
she	1
had	1
scarcely	1
replied	1
before	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
exultation	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
discovery	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
said	1
he	1
by	1
a	1
singular	1
accident	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
near	1
relation	1
of	1
my	1
patroness	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
overhear	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
mentioning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
does	1
the	1
honours	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
cousin	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
How	1
wonderfully	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
things	1
occur	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
meeting	1
with	1
perhaps	1
a	1
nephew	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
in	1
this	1
assembly	1
I	1
am	1
most	1
thankful	1
that	1
the	1
discovery	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
pay	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
trust	1
he	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
before	1
My	1
total	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
connection	1
must	1
plead	1
my	1
apology	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
introduce	1
yourself	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
Indeed	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
shall	1
entreat	1
his	1
pardon	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
earlier	1
I	1
believe	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
nephew	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
yesterday	1
se	1
nnight	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
scheme	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
would	1
consider	1
his	1
addressing	1
him	1
without	1
introduction	1
as	1
an	1
impertinent	1
freedom	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
his	1
aunt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
necessary	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
notice	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
it	1
must	1
belong	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
the	1
superior	1
in	1
consequence	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
determined	1
air	1
of	1
following	1
his	1
own	1
inclination	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
replied	1
thus	1
My	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
your	1
excellent	1
judgement	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
within	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
your	1
understanding	1
but	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
wide	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
established	1
forms	1
of	1
ceremony	1
amongst	1
the	1
laity	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
regulate	1
the	1
clergy	1
for	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
I	1
consider	1
the	1
clerical	1
office	1
as	1
equal	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
dignity	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
provided	1
that	1
a	1
proper	1
humility	1
of	1
behaviour	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
maintained	1
You	1
must	1
therefore	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
my	1
conscience	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
which	1
leads	1
me	1
to	1
perform	1
what	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
duty	1
Pardon	1
me	1
for	1
neglecting	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
your	1
advice	1
which	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
subject	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
constant	1
guide	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
us	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
more	1
fitted	1
by	1
education	1
and	1
habitual	1
study	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
than	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
like	1
yourself	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
attack	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
whose	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
advances	1
she	1
eagerly	1
watched	1
and	1
whose	1
astonishment	1
at	1
being	1
so	1
addressed	1
was	1
very	1
evident	1
Her	1
cousin	1
prefaced	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
bow	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
hearing	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
words	1
apology	1
Hunsford	1
and	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
It	1
vexed	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
expose	1
himself	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
was	1
eyeing	1
him	1
with	1
unrestrained	1
wonder	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
allowed	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
speak	1
replied	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
distant	1
civility	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
discouraged	1
from	1
speaking	1
again	1
and	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
contempt	1
seemed	1
abundantly	1
increasing	1
with	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
second	1
speech	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
only	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
and	1
moved	1
another	1
way	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
my	1
reception	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
seemed	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
attention	1
He	1
answered	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
civility	1
and	1
even	1
paid	1
me	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
convinced	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
discernment	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
bestow	1
a	1
favour	1
unworthily	1
It	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
thought	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
him	1
As	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
to	1
pursue	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
attention	1
almost	1
entirely	1
on	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
agreeable	1
reflections	1
which	1
her	1
observations	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
made	1
her	1
perhaps	1
almost	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
Jane	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
idea	1
settled	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
house	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
felicity	1
which	1
a	1
marriage	1
of	1
true	1
affection	1
could	1
bestow	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
capable	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
even	1
to	1
like	1
Bingley	1
s	1
two	1
sisters	1
Her	1
mother	1
s	1
thoughts	1
she	1
plainly	1
saw	1
were	1
bent	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
and	1
she	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
venture	1
near	1
her	1
lest	1
she	1
might	1
hear	1
too	1
much	1
When	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
supper	1
therefore	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
unlucky	1
perverseness	1
which	1
placed	1
them	1
within	1
one	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
deeply	1
was	1
she	1
vexed	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
person	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
freely	1
openly	1
and	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
her	1
expectation	1
that	1
Jane	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
animating	1
subject	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
seemed	1
incapable	1
of	1
fatigue	1
while	1
enumerating	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
match	1
His	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
charming	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
so	1
rich	1
and	1
living	1
but	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
points	1
of	1
self	1
gratulation	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
were	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
desire	1
the	1
connection	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
It	1
was	1
moreover	1
such	1
a	1
promising	1
thing	1
for	1
her	1
younger	1
daughters	1
as	1
Jane	1
s	1
marrying	1
so	1
greatly	1
must	1
throw	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
other	1
rich	1
men	1
and	1
lastly	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
pleasant	1
at	1
her	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
consign	1
her	1
single	1
daughters	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
their	1
sister	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
company	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
liked	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
circumstance	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure	1
because	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
etiquette	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
less	1
likely	1
than	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
to	1
find	1
comfort	1
in	1
staying	1
home	1
at	1
any	1
period	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
She	1
concluded	1
with	1
many	1
good	1
wishes	1
that	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
might	1
soon	1
be	1
equally	1
fortunate	1
though	1
evidently	1
and	1
triumphantly	1
believing	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
In	1
vain	1
did	1
Elizabeth	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
words	1
or	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
describe	1
her	1
felicity	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
audible	1
whisper	1
for	1
to	1
her	1
inexpressible	1
vexation	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
overheard	1
by	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite	1
to	1
them	1
Her	1
mother	1
only	1
scolded	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
nonsensical	1
What	1
is	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
to	1
me	1
pray	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
owe	1
him	1
no	1
such	1
particular	1
civility	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
For	1
heaven	1
s	1
sake	1
madam	1
speak	1
lower	1
What	1
advantage	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
offend	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
You	1
will	1
never	1
recommend	1
yourself	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
Nothing	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
however	1
had	1
any	1
influence	1
Her	1
mother	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
her	1
views	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
intelligible	1
tone	1
Elizabeth	1
blushed	1
and	1
blushed	1
again	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
frequently	1
glancing	1
her	1
eye	1
at	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
though	1
every	1
glance	1
convinced	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
dreaded	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
mother	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
invariably	1
fixed	1
by	1
her	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
changed	1
gradually	1
from	1
indignant	1
contempt	1
to	1
a	1
composed	1
and	1
steady	1
gravity	1
At	1
length	1
however	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
yawning	1
at	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
delights	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
likelihood	1
of	1
sharing	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
cold	1
ham	1
and	1
chicken	1
Elizabeth	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
revive	1
But	1
not	1
long	1
was	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
for	1
when	1
supper	1
was	1
over	1
singing	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
mortification	1
of	1
seeing	1
Mary	1
after	1
very	1
little	1
entreaty	1
preparing	1
to	1
oblige	1
the	1
company	1
By	1
many	1
significant	1
looks	1
and	1
silent	1
entreaties	1
did	1
she	1
endeavour	1
to	1
prevent	1
such	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
complaisance	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
Mary	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
exhibiting	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
her	1
song	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
most	1
painful	1
sensations	1
and	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
progress	1
through	1
the	1
several	1
stanzas	1
with	1
an	1
impatience	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1
rewarded	1
at	1
their	1
close	1
for	1
Mary	1
on	1
receiving	1
amongst	1
the	1
thanks	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
favour	1
them	1
again	1
after	1
the	1
pause	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
began	1
another	1
Mary	1
s	1
powers	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
display	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
weak	1
and	1
her	1
manner	1
affected	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
in	1
agonies	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Jane	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
bore	1
it	1
but	1
Jane	1
was	1
very	1
composedly	1
talking	1
to	1
Bingley	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
making	1
signs	1
of	1
derision	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
at	1
Darcy	1
who	1
continued	1
however	1
imperturbably	1
grave	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
entreat	1
his	1
interference	1
lest	1
Mary	1
should	1
be	1
singing	1
all	1
night	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
hint	1
and	1
when	1
Mary	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
second	1
song	1
said	1
aloud	1
That	1
will	1
do	1
extremely	1
well	1
child	1
You	1
have	1
delighted	1
us	1
long	1
enough	1
Let	1
the	1
other	1
young	1
ladies	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
exhibit	1
Mary	1
though	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
was	1
somewhat	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
father	1
s	1
speech	1
was	1
afraid	1
her	1
anxiety	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
good	1
Others	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
now	1
applied	1
to	1
If	1
I	1
said	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
were	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
sing	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
great	1
pleasure	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
in	1
obliging	1
the	1
company	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
for	1
I	1
consider	1
music	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
innocent	1
diversion	1
and	1
perfectly	1
compatible	1
with	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
a	1
clergyman	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
however	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
devoting	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
our	1
time	1
to	1
music	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
certainly	1
other	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
attended	1
to	1
The	1
rector	1
of	1
a	1
parish	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
agreement	1
for	1
tithes	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
beneficial	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
offensive	1
to	1
his	1
patron	1
He	1
must	1
write	1
his	1
own	1
sermons	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
remains	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
his	1
parish	1
duties	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
improvement	1
of	1
his	1
dwelling	1
which	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
excused	1
from	1
making	1
as	1
comfortable	1
as	1
possible	1
And	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
of	1
light	1
importance	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
attentive	1
and	1
conciliatory	1
manners	1
towards	1
everybody	1
especially	1
towards	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
owes	1
his	1
preferment	1
I	1
cannot	1
acquit	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
duty	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
should	1
omit	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
testifying	1
his	1
respect	1
towards	1
anybody	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
speech	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
so	1
loud	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
half	1
the	1
room	1
Many	1
stared	1
many	1
smiled	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
looked	1
more	1
amused	1
than	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
himself	1
while	1
his	1
wife	1
seriously	1
commended	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
for	1
having	1
spoken	1
so	1
sensibly	1
and	1
observed	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
to	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
remarkably	1
clever	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
young	1
man	1
To	1
Elizabeth	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
had	1
her	1
family	1
made	1
an	1
agreement	1
to	1
expose	1
themselves	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
during	1
the	1
evening	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
play	1
their	1
parts	1
with	1
more	1
spirit	1
or	1
finer	1
success	1
and	1
happy	1
did	1
she	1
think	1
it	1
for	1
Bingley	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
exhibition	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
notice	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
distressed	1
by	1
the	1
folly	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
witnessed	1
That	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
and	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
however	1
should	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
ridiculing	1
her	1
relations	1
was	1
bad	1
enough	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
determine	1
whether	1
the	1
silent	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
or	1
the	1
insolent	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
more	1
intolerable	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
brought	1
her	1
little	1
amusement	1
She	1
was	1
teased	1
by	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
who	1
continued	1
most	1
perseveringly	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
again	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
others	1
In	1
vain	1
did	1
she	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
somebody	1
else	1
and	1
offer	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
any	1
young	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
He	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
dancing	1
he	1
was	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
his	1
chief	1
object	1
was	1
by	1
delicate	1
attentions	1
to	1
recommend	1
himself	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
therefore	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
remaining	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
arguing	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
project	1
She	1
owed	1
her	1
greatest	1
relief	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
who	1
often	1
joined	1
them	1
and	1
good	1
naturedly	1
engaged	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
conversation	1
to	1
herself	1
She	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
offense	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
further	1
notice	1
though	1
often	1
standing	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
distance	1
of	1
her	1
quite	1
disengaged	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
speak	1
She	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
probable	1
consequence	1
of	1
her	1
allusions	1
to	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it	1
The	1
Longbourn	1
party	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
to	1
depart	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
manoeuvre	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
carriage	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
everybody	1
else	1
was	1
gone	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
heartily	1
they	1
were	1
wished	1
away	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
scarcely	1
opened	1
their	1
mouths	1
except	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
fatigue	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
impatient	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
themselves	1
They	1
repulsed	1
every	1
attempt	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
at	1
conversation	1
and	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
threw	1
a	1
languor	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
relieved	1
by	1
the	1
long	1
speeches	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
who	1
was	1
complimenting	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
on	1
the	1
elegance	1
of	1
their	1
entertainment	1
and	1
the	1
hospitality	1
and	1
politeness	1
which	1
had	1
marked	1
their	1
behaviour	1
to	1
their	1
guests	1
Darcy	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
in	1
equal	1
silence	1
was	1
enjoying	1
the	1
scene	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
were	1
standing	1
together	1
a	1
little	1
detached	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
talked	1
only	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
Elizabeth	1
preserved	1
as	1
steady	1
a	1
silence	1
as	1
either	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
or	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
even	1
Lydia	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
fatigued	1
to	1
utter	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
occasional	1
exclamation	1
of	1
Lord	1
how	1
tired	1
I	1
am	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
violent	1
yawn	1
When	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
arose	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
most	1
pressingly	1
civil	1
in	1
her	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
soon	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
and	1
addressed	1
herself	1
especially	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
how	1
happy	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
by	1
eating	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
without	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
a	1
formal	1
invitation	1
Bingley	1
was	1
all	1
grateful	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
readily	1
engaged	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
earliest	1
opportunity	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
her	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
London	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
under	1
the	1
delightful	1
persuasion	1
that	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
necessary	1
preparations	1
of	1
settlements	1
new	1
carriages	1
and	1
wedding	1
clothes	1
she	1
should	1
undoubtedly	1
see	1
her	1
daughter	1
settled	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
months	1
Of	1
having	1
another	1
daughter	1
married	1
to	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
she	1
thought	1
with	1
equal	1
certainty	1
and	1
with	1
considerable	1
though	1
not	1
equal	1
pleasure	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
children	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
match	1
were	1
quite	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
each	1
was	1
eclipsed	1
by	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Netherfield	1
Chapter	1
19	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
opened	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
made	1
his	1
declaration	1
in	1
form	1
Having	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
as	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
extended	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
Saturday	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
feelings	1
of	1
diffidence	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
distressing	1
to	1
himself	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
orderly	1
manner	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
observances	1
which	1
he	1
supposed	1
a	1
regular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
On	1
finding	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
together	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
May	1
I	1
hope	1
madam	1
for	1
your	1
interest	1
with	1
your	1
fair	1
daughter	1
Elizabeth	1
when	1
I	1
solicit	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
audience	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
morning	1
Before	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
time	1
for	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
blush	1
of	1
surprise	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
answered	1
instantly	1
Oh	1
dear	1
yes	1
certainly	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Lizzy	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
Come	1
Kitty	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
up	1
stairs	1
And	1
gathering	1
her	1
work	1
together	1
she	1
was	1
hastening	1
away	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
called	1
out	1
Dear	1
madam	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
must	1
excuse	1
me	1
He	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
anybody	1
need	1
not	1
hear	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
myself	1
No	1
no	1
nonsense	1
Lizzy	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
to	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
And	1
upon	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
seeming	1
really	1
with	1
vexed	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
looks	1
about	1
to	1
escape	1
she	1
added	1
Lizzy	1
I	1
insist	1
upon	1
your	1
staying	1
and	1
hearing	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
an	1
injunction	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
consideration	1
making	1
her	1
also	1
sensible	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wisest	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
over	1
as	1
soon	1
and	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
by	1
incessant	1
employment	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
were	1
divided	1
between	1
distress	1
and	1
diversion	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
Kitty	1
walked	1
off	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
began	1
Believe	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
that	1
your	1
modesty	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
doing	1
you	1
any	1
disservice	1
rather	1
adds	1
to	1
your	1
other	1
perfections	1
You	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
amiable	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
had	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
this	1
little	1
unwillingness	1
but	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
your	1
respected	1
mother	1
s	1
permission	1
for	1
this	1
address	1
You	1
can	1
hardly	1
doubt	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
my	1
discourse	1
however	1
your	1
natural	1
delicacy	1
may	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
dissemble	1
my	1
attentions	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
marked	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
Almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
I	1
singled	1
you	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
future	1
life	1
But	1
before	1
I	1
am	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
my	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
advisable	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
state	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
marrying	1
and	1
moreover	1
for	1
coming	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
selecting	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
I	1
certainly	1
did	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
solemn	1
composure	1
being	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
his	1
feelings	1
made	1
Elizabeth	1
so	1
near	1
laughing	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
use	1
the	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
allowed	1
in	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
further	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
My	1
reasons	1
for	1
marrying	1
are	1
first	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
right	1
thing	1
for	1
every	1
clergyman	1
in	1
easy	1
circumstances	1
like	1
myself	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
matrimony	1
in	1
his	1
parish	1
secondly	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
add	1
very	1
greatly	1
to	1
my	1
happiness	1
and	1
thirdly	1
which	1
perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
mentioned	1
earlier	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
particular	1
advice	1
and	1
recommendation	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
noble	1
lady	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
calling	1
patroness	1
Twice	1
has	1
she	1
condescended	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
her	1
opinion	1
unasked	1
too	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
Saturday	1
night	1
before	1
I	1
left	1
Hunsford	1
between	1
our	1
pools	1
at	1
quadrille	1
while	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
was	1
arranging	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
s	1
footstool	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
you	1
must	1
marry	1
A	1
clergyman	1
like	1
you	1
must	1
marry	1
Choose	1
properly	1
choose	1
a	1
gentlewoman	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
an	1
active	1
useful	1
sort	1
of	1
person	1
not	1
brought	1
up	1
high	1
but	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
small	1
income	1
go	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
advice	1
Find	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
Hunsford	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
her	1
Allow	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
observe	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
reckon	1
the	1
notice	1
and	1
kindness	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
offer	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
her	1
manners	1
beyond	1
anything	1
I	1
can	1
describe	1
and	1
your	1
wit	1
and	1
vivacity	1
I	1
think	1
must	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
her	1
especially	1
when	1
tempered	1
with	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
her	1
rank	1
will	1
inevitably	1
excite	1
Thus	1
much	1
for	1
my	1
general	1
intention	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
matrimony	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
why	1
my	1
views	1
were	1
directed	1
towards	1
Longbourn	1
instead	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
neighbourhood	1
where	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
amiable	1
young	1
women	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
being	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
inherit	1
this	1
estate	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
your	1
honoured	1
father	1
who	1
however	1
may	1
live	1
many	1
years	1
longer	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
without	1
resolving	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
daughters	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
to	1
them	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
when	1
the	1
melancholy	1
event	1
takes	1
place	1
which	1
however	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
This	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
motive	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
and	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
sink	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
esteem	1
And	1
now	1
nothing	1
remains	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
animated	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
my	1
affection	1
To	1
fortune	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
no	1
demand	1
of	1
that	1
nature	1
on	1
your	1
father	1
since	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
complied	1
with	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
per	1
cents	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
yours	1
till	1
after	1
your	1
mother	1
s	1
decease	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
On	1
that	1
head	1
therefore	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
uniformly	1
silent	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
assure	1
yourself	1
that	1
no	1
ungenerous	1
reproach	1
shall	1
ever	1
pass	1
my	1
lips	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
married	1
It	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
interrupt	1
him	1
now	1
You	1
are	1
too	1
hasty	1
sir	1
she	1
cried	1
You	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
Let	1
me	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
Accept	1
my	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
compliment	1
you	1
are	1
paying	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
your	1
proposals	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
otherwise	1
than	1
to	1
decline	1
them	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
now	1
to	1
learn	1
replied	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
with	1
a	1
formal	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
usual	1
with	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
addresses	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
secretly	1
mean	1
to	1
accept	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
applies	1
for	1
their	1
favour	1
and	1
that	1
sometimes	1
the	1
refusal	1
is	1
repeated	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
therefore	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
discouraged	1
by	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
and	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
ere	1
long	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
sir	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
your	1
hope	1
is	1
a	1
rather	1
extraordinary	1
one	1
after	1
my	1
declaration	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
if	1
such	1
young	1
ladies	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
daring	1
as	1
to	1
risk	1
their	1
happiness	1
on	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
asked	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
serious	1
in	1
my	1
refusal	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
could	1
make	1
you	1
so	1
Nay	1
were	1
your	1
friend	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
to	1
know	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
ill	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
situation	1
Were	1
it	1
certain	1
that	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
would	1
think	1
so	1
said	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
very	1
gravely	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
disapprove	1
of	1
you	1
And	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
certain	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
again	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
terms	1
of	1
your	1
modesty	1
economy	1
and	1
other	1
amiable	1
qualification	1
Indeed	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
all	1
praise	1
of	1
me	1
will	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
You	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
pay	1
me	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
believing	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
by	1
refusing	1
your	1
hand	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
being	1
otherwise	1
In	1
making	1
me	1
the	1
offer	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
satisfied	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
your	1
feelings	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
may	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
whenever	1
it	1
falls	1
without	1
any	1
self	1
reproach	1
This	1
matter	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
therefore	1
as	1
finally	1
settled	1
And	1
rising	1
as	1
she	1
thus	1
spoke	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
not	1
thus	1
addressed	1
her	1
When	1
I	1
do	1
myself	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
you	1
next	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
I	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
more	1
favourable	1
answer	1
than	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
given	1
me	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
accusing	1
you	1
of	1
cruelty	1
at	1
present	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
established	1
custom	1
of	1
your	1
sex	1
to	1
reject	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
application	1
and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
now	1
said	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
encourage	1
my	1
suit	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
consistent	1
with	1
the	1
true	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
female	1
character	1
Really	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
some	1
warmth	1
you	1
puzzle	1
me	1
exceedingly	1
If	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
hitherto	1
said	1
can	1
appear	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
encouragement	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
refusal	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
convince	1
you	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
one	1
You	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
flatter	1
myself	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
that	1
your	1
refusal	1
of	1
my	1
addresses	1
is	1
merely	1
words	1
of	1
course	1
My	1
reasons	1
for	1
believing	1
it	1
are	1
briefly	1
these	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
hand	1
is	1
unworthy	1
of	1
your	1
acceptance	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
establishment	1
I	1
can	1
offer	1
would	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
than	1
highly	1
desirable	1
My	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
my	1
connections	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
and	1
my	1
relationship	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
are	1
circumstances	1
highly	1
in	1
my	1
favour	1
and	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
further	1
consideration	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
your	1
manifold	1
attractions	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
certain	1
that	1
another	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
you	1
Your	1
portion	1
is	1
unhappily	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
undo	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
your	1
loveliness	1
and	1
amiable	1
qualifications	1
As	1
I	1
must	1
therefore	1
conclude	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
serious	1
in	1
your	1
rejection	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
attribute	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
wish	1
of	1
increasing	1
my	1
love	1
by	1
suspense	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
practice	1
of	1
elegant	1
females	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
sir	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pretensions	1
whatever	1
to	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
elegance	1
which	1
consists	1
in	1
tormenting	1
a	1
respectable	1
man	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
paid	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
being	1
believed	1
sincere	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
proposals	1
but	1
to	1
accept	1
them	1
is	1
absolutely	1
impossible	1
My	1
feelings	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
forbid	1
it	1
Can	1
I	1
speak	1
plainer	1
Do	1
not	1
consider	1
me	1
now	1
as	1
an	1
elegant	1
female	1
intending	1
to	1
plague	1
you	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
rational	1
creature	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
You	1
are	1
uniformly	1
charming	1
cried	1
he	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
awkward	1
gallantry	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
when	1
sanctioned	1
by	1
the	1
express	1
authority	1
of	1
both	1
your	1
excellent	1
parents	1
my	1
proposals	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
of	1
being	1
acceptable	1
To	1
such	1
perseverance	1
in	1
wilful	1
self	1
deception	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
make	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
immediately	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
withdrew	1
determined	1
if	1
he	1
persisted	1
in	1
considering	1
her	1
repeated	1
refusals	1
as	1
flattering	1
encouragement	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
whose	1
negative	1
might	1
be	1
uttered	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
decisive	1
and	1
whose	1
behaviour	1
at	1
least	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
the	1
affectation	1
and	1
coquetry	1
of	1
an	1
elegant	1
female	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
long	1
to	1
the	1
silent	1
contemplation	1
of	1
his	1
successful	1
love	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
having	1
dawdled	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
conference	1
no	1
sooner	1
saw	1
Elizabeth	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
with	1
quick	1
step	1
pass	1
her	1
towards	1
the	1
staircase	1
than	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room	1
and	1
congratulated	1
both	1
him	1
and	1
herself	1
in	1
warm	1
terms	1
on	1
the	1
happy	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
nearer	1
connection	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
received	1
and	1
returned	1
these	1
felicitations	1
with	1
equal	1
pleasure	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
relate	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
he	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
since	1
the	1
refusal	1
which	1
his	1
cousin	1
had	1
steadfastly	1
given	1
him	1
would	1
naturally	1
flow	1
from	1
her	1
bashful	1
modesty	1
and	1
the	1
genuine	1
delicacy	1
of	1
her	1
character	1
This	1
information	1
however	1
startled	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
satisfied	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
encourage	1
him	1
by	1
protesting	1
against	1
his	1
proposals	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
so	1
But	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
she	1
added	1
that	1
Lizzy	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
reason	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
it	1
directly	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
headstrong	1
foolish	1
girl	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
own	1
interest	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
know	1
it	1
Pardon	1
me	1
for	1
interrupting	1
you	1
madam	1
cried	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
but	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
really	1
headstrong	1
and	1
foolish	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
altogether	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
wife	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
situation	1
who	1
naturally	1
looks	1
for	1
happiness	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
state	1
If	1
therefore	1
she	1
actually	1
persists	1
in	1
rejecting	1
my	1
suit	1
perhaps	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
into	1
accepting	1
me	1
because	1
if	1
liable	1
to	1
such	1
defects	1
of	1
temper	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
contribute	1
much	1
to	1
my	1
felicity	1
Sir	1
you	1
quite	1
misunderstand	1
me	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
alarmed	1
Lizzy	1
is	1
only	1
headstrong	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
as	1
these	1
In	1
everything	1
else	1
she	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
natured	1
a	1
girl	1
as	1
ever	1
lived	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
directly	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
very	1
soon	1
settle	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
reply	1
but	1
hurrying	1
instantly	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
called	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
library	1
Oh	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
you	1
are	1
wanted	1
immediately	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
an	1
uproar	1
You	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
make	1
Lizzy	1
marry	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
for	1
she	1
vows	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
him	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
haste	1
he	1
will	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
and	1
fixed	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
unconcern	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
altered	1
by	1
her	1
communication	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
understanding	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
speech	1
Of	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
Of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
Lizzy	1
Lizzy	1
declares	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
begins	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
Lizzy	1
And	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
It	1
seems	1
an	1
hopeless	1
business	1
Speak	1
to	1
Lizzy	1
about	1
it	1
yourself	1
Tell	1
her	1
that	1
you	1
insist	1
upon	1
her	1
marrying	1
him	1
Let	1
her	1
be	1
called	1
down	1
She	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
opinion	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
Come	1
here	1
child	1
cried	1
her	1
father	1
as	1
she	1
appeared	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
on	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
importance	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
Elizabeth	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Very	1
well	1
and	1
this	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
you	1
have	1
refused	1
I	1
have	1
sir	1
Very	1
well	1
We	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
Your	1
mother	1
insists	1
upon	1
your	1
accepting	1
it	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
Yes	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
her	1
again	1
An	1
unhappy	1
alternative	1
is	1
before	1
you	1
Elizabeth	1
From	1
this	1
day	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
stranger	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
Your	1
mother	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
marry	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
smile	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
beginning	1
but	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
who	1
had	1
persuaded	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
regarded	1
the	1
affair	1
as	1
she	1
wished	1
was	1
excessively	1
disappointed	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
in	1
talking	1
this	1
way	1
You	1
promised	1
me	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
her	1
marrying	1
him	1
My	1
dear	1
replied	1
her	1
husband	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
small	1
favours	1
to	1
request	1
First	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
the	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
my	1
understanding	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
and	1
secondly	1
of	1
my	1
room	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
library	1
to	1
myself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
Not	1
yet	1
however	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
disappointment	1
in	1
her	1
husband	1
did	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
point	1
She	1
talked	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
coaxed	1
and	1
threatened	1
her	1
by	1
turns	1
She	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
secure	1
Jane	1
in	1
her	1
interest	1
but	1
Jane	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
mildness	1
declined	1
interfering	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
sometimes	1
with	1
real	1
earnestness	1
and	1
sometimes	1
with	1
playful	1
gaiety	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
attacks	1
Though	1
her	1
manner	1
varied	1
however	1
her	1
determination	1
never	1
did	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
meanwhile	1
was	1
meditating	1
in	1
solitude	1
on	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
He	1
thought	1
too	1
well	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
comprehend	1
on	1
what	1
motives	1
his	1
cousin	1
could	1
refuse	1
him	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
pride	1
was	1
hurt	1
he	1
suffered	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
His	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
quite	1
imaginary	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
her	1
deserving	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
reproach	1
prevented	1
his	1
feeling	1
any	1
regret	1
While	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
in	1
this	1
confusion	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
came	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
them	1
She	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
by	1
Lydia	1
who	1
flying	1
to	1
her	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
fun	1
here	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
has	1
happened	1
this	1
morning	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
has	1
made	1
an	1
offer	1
to	1
Lizzy	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
him	1
Charlotte	1
hardly	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
answer	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
Kitty	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
same	1
news	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room	1
where	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
alone	1
than	1
she	1
likewise	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
calling	1
on	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
for	1
her	1
compassion	1
and	1
entreating	1
her	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
friend	1
Lizzy	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
Pray	1
do	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
tone	1
for	1
nobody	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
nobody	1
takes	1
part	1
with	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
cruelly	1
used	1
nobody	1
feels	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
nerves	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
reply	1
was	1
spared	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
Aye	1
there	1
she	1
comes	1
continued	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
looking	1
as	1
unconcerned	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
and	1
caring	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
us	1
than	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
York	1
provided	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Miss	1
Lizzy	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
head	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
refusing	1
every	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
husband	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
when	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
dead	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
warn	1
you	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
very	1
day	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
my	1
word	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
undutiful	1
children	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
pleasure	1
indeed	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
anybody	1
People	1
who	1
suffer	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
from	1
nervous	1
complaints	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
great	1
inclination	1
for	1
talking	1
Nobody	1
can	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
suffer	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
Those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
complain	1
are	1
never	1
pitied	1
Her	1
daughters	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
this	1
effusion	1
sensible	1
that	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
soothe	1
her	1
would	1
only	1
increase	1
the	1
irritation	1
She	1
talked	1
on	1
therefore	1
without	1
interruption	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
who	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
more	1
stately	1
than	1
usual	1
and	1
on	1
perceiving	1
whom	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
girls	1
Now	1
I	1
do	1
insist	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
hold	1
your	1
tongues	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
and	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
conversation	1
together	1
Elizabeth	1
passed	1
quietly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
Jane	1
and	1
Kitty	1
followed	1
but	1
Lydia	1
stood	1
her	1
ground	1
determined	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
detained	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
civility	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
whose	1
inquiries	1
after	1
herself	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
were	1
very	1
minute	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
curiosity	1
satisfied	1
herself	1
with	1
walking	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
In	1
a	1
doleful	1
voice	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
began	1
the	1
projected	1
conversation	1
Oh	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
My	1
dear	1
madam	1
replied	1
he	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
silent	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
he	1
presently	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
marked	1
his	1
displeasure	1
to	1
resent	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
your	1
daughter	1
Resignation	1
to	1
inevitable	1
evils	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
peculiar	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
early	1
preferment	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
am	1
resigned	1
Perhaps	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
so	1
from	1
feeling	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
positive	1
happiness	1
had	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
honoured	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
observed	1
that	1
resignation	1
is	1
never	1
so	1
perfect	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
blessing	1
denied	1
begins	1
to	1
lose	1
somewhat	1
of	1
its	1
value	1
in	1
our	1
estimation	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
I	1
hope	1
consider	1
me	1
as	1
showing	1
any	1
disrespect	1
to	1
your	1
family	1
my	1
dear	1
madam	1
by	1
thus	1
withdrawing	1
my	1
pretensions	1
to	1
your	1
daughter	1
s	1
favour	1
without	1
having	1
paid	1
yourself	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
requesting	1
you	1
to	1
interpose	1
your	1
authority	1
in	1
my	1
behalf	1
My	1
conduct	1
may	1
I	1
fear	1
be	1
objectionable	1
in	1
having	1
accepted	1
my	1
dismission	1
from	1
your	1
daughter	1
s	1
lips	1
instead	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
liable	1
to	1
error	1
I	1
have	1
certainly	1
meant	1
well	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
My	1
object	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
secure	1
an	1
amiable	1
companion	1
for	1
myself	1
with	1
due	1
consideration	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
family	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
manner	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
reprehensible	1
I	1
here	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
apologise	1
Chapter	1
21	1
The	1
discussion	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
offer	1
was	1
now	1
nearly	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
uncomfortable	1
feelings	1
necessarily	1
attending	1
it	1
and	1
occasionally	1
from	1
some	1
peevish	1
allusions	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
chiefly	1
expressed	1
not	1
by	1
embarrassment	1
or	1
dejection	1
or	1
by	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
but	1
by	1
stiffness	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
resentful	1
silence	1
He	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
assiduous	1
attentions	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
sensible	1
of	1
himself	1
were	1
transferred	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
whose	1
civility	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
seasonable	1
relief	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
The	1
morrow	1
produced	1
no	1
abatement	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
ill	1
humour	1
or	1
ill	1
health	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
angry	1
pride	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
resentment	1
might	1
shorten	1
his	1
visit	1
but	1
his	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
Saturday	1
and	1
to	1
Saturday	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
After	1
breakfast	1
the	1
girls	1
walked	1
to	1
Meryton	1
to	1
inquire	1
if	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
were	1
returned	1
and	1
to	1
lament	1
over	1
his	1
absence	1
from	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
ball	1
He	1
joined	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
entering	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
attended	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
aunt	1
s	1
where	1
his	1
regret	1
and	1
vexation	1
and	1
the	1
concern	1
of	1
everybody	1
was	1
well	1
talked	1
over	1
To	1
Elizabeth	1
however	1
he	1
voluntarily	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
had	1
been	1
self	1
imposed	1
I	1
found	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
near	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
meet	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room	1
the	1
same	1
party	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
together	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
bear	1
and	1
that	1
scenes	1
might	1
arise	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
myself	1
She	1
highly	1
approved	1
his	1
forbearance	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
leisure	1
for	1
a	1
full	1
discussion	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
commendation	1
which	1
they	1
civilly	1
bestowed	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
Wickham	1
and	1
another	1
officer	1
walked	1
back	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
walk	1
he	1
particularly	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
His	1
accompanying	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
advantage	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
compliment	1
it	1
offered	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
acceptable	1
as	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
introducing	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
Soon	1
after	1
their	1
return	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
The	1
envelope	1
contained	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
elegant	1
little	1
hot	1
pressed	1
paper	1
well	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
lady	1
s	1
fair	1
flowing	1
hand	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
countenance	1
change	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
dwelling	1
intently	1
on	1
some	1
particular	1
passages	1
Jane	1
recollected	1
herself	1
soon	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
letter	1
away	1
tried	1
to	1
join	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
an	1
anxiety	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
drew	1
off	1
her	1
attention	1
even	1
from	1
Wickham	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
taken	1
leave	1
than	1
a	1
glance	1
from	1
Jane	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
up	1
stairs	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gained	1
their	1
own	1
room	1
Jane	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
letter	1
said	1
This	1
is	1
from	1
Caroline	1
Bingley	1
what	1
it	1
contains	1
has	1
surprised	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
have	1
left	1
Netherfield	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
coming	1
back	1
again	1
You	1
shall	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
says	1
She	1
then	1
read	1
the	1
first	1
sentence	1
aloud	1
which	1
comprised	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
just	1
resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
their	1
brother	1
to	1
town	1
directly	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
meaning	1
to	1
dine	1
in	1
Grosvenor	1
Street	1
where	1
Mr	1
Hurst	1
had	1
a	1
house	1
The	1
next	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
regret	1
anything	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
except	1
your	1
society	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
hope	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
period	1
to	1
enjoy	1
many	1
returns	1
of	1
that	1
delightful	1
intercourse	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile	1
may	1
lessen	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
frequent	1
and	1
most	1
unreserved	1
correspondence	1
I	1
depend	1
on	1
you	1
for	1
that	1
To	1
these	1
highflown	1
expressions	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
insensibility	1
of	1
distrust	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
suddenness	1
of	1
their	1
removal	1
surprised	1
her	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
really	1
to	1
lament	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
their	1
absence	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
would	1
prevent	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
being	1
there	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
society	1
she	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Jane	1
must	1
cease	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
his	1
It	1
is	1
unlucky	1
said	1
she	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
friends	1
before	1
they	1
leave	1
the	1
country	1
But	1
may	1
we	1
not	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
to	1
which	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
looks	1
forward	1
may	1
arrive	1
earlier	1
than	1
she	1
is	1
aware	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
delightful	1
intercourse	1
you	1
have	1
known	1
as	1
friends	1
will	1
be	1
renewed	1
with	1
yet	1
greater	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
sisters	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
detained	1
in	1
London	1
by	1
them	1
Caroline	1
decidedly	1
says	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
will	1
return	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
this	1
winter	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
When	1
my	1
brother	1
left	1
us	1
yesterday	1
he	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
London	1
might	1
be	1
concluded	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
certain	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
so	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
convinced	1
that	1
when	1
Charles	1
gets	1
to	1
town	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
again	1
we	1
have	1
determined	1
on	1
following	1
him	1
thither	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
vacant	1
hours	1
in	1
a	1
comfortless	1
hotel	1
Many	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintances	1
are	1
already	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
winter	1
I	1
wish	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend	1
had	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
making	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
but	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
despair	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
your	1
Christmas	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
gaieties	1
which	1
that	1
season	1
generally	1
brings	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
beaux	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
feeling	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
shall	1
deprive	1
you	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
by	1
this	1
added	1
Jane	1
that	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
no	1
more	1
this	1
winter	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
evident	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
Why	1
will	1
you	1
think	1
so	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
own	1
doing	1
He	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
master	1
But	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
all	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
you	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
particularly	1
hurts	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
reserves	1
from	1
you	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
is	1
impatient	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
to	1
confess	1
the	1
truth	1
we	1
are	1
scarcely	1
less	1
eager	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
again	1
I	1
really	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
Georgiana	1
Darcy	1
has	1
her	1
equal	1
for	1
beauty	1
elegance	1
and	1
accomplishments	1
and	1
the	1
affection	1
she	1
inspires	1
in	1
Louisa	1
and	1
myself	1
is	1
heightened	1
into	1
something	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
we	1
dare	1
entertain	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
hereafter	1
our	1
sister	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
ever	1
before	1
mentioned	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
country	1
without	1
confiding	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
esteem	1
them	1
unreasonable	1
My	1
brother	1
admires	1
her	1
greatly	1
already	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
frequent	1
opportunity	1
now	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
footing	1
her	1
relations	1
all	1
wish	1
the	1
connection	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
a	1
sister	1
s	1
partiality	1
is	1
not	1
misleading	1
me	1
I	1
think	1
when	1
I	1
call	1
Charles	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
engaging	1
any	1
woman	1
s	1
heart	1
With	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances	1
to	1
favour	1
an	1
attachment	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
it	1
am	1
I	1
wrong	1
my	1
dearest	1
Jane	1
in	1
indulging	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
will	1
secure	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
sentence	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizzy	1
said	1
Jane	1
as	1
she	1
finished	1
it	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
clear	1
enough	1
Does	1
it	1
not	1
expressly	1
declare	1
that	1
Caroline	1
neither	1
expects	1
nor	1
wishes	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
indifference	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
suspects	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
for	1
him	1
she	1
means	1
most	1
kindly	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
guard	1
Can	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
Yes	1
there	1
can	1
for	1
mine	1
is	1
totally	1
different	1
Will	1
you	1
hear	1
it	1
Most	1
willingly	1
You	1
shall	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
sees	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
wants	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
She	1
follows	1
him	1
to	1
town	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
keeping	1
him	1
there	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
persuade	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
you	1
Jane	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
Indeed	1
Jane	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
No	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
seen	1
you	1
together	1
can	1
doubt	1
his	1
affection	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
cannot	1
She	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
simpleton	1
Could	1
she	1
have	1
seen	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
love	1
in	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
ordered	1
her	1
wedding	1
clothes	1
But	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
this	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
rich	1
enough	1
or	1
grand	1
enough	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
from	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
intermarriage	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
less	1
trouble	1
in	1
achieving	1
a	1
second	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
certainly	1
some	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
would	1
succeed	1
if	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
But	1
my	1
dearest	1
Jane	1
you	1
cannot	1
seriously	1
imagine	1
that	1
because	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
tells	1
you	1
her	1
brother	1
greatly	1
admires	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
degree	1
less	1
sensible	1
of	1
your	1
merit	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
If	1
we	1
thought	1
alike	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
replied	1
Jane	1
your	1
representation	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
might	1
make	1
me	1
quite	1
easy	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
foundation	1
is	1
unjust	1
Caroline	1
is	1
incapable	1
of	1
wilfully	1
deceiving	1
anyone	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
hope	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
deceiving	1
herself	1
That	1
is	1
right	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
started	1
a	1
more	1
happy	1
idea	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
comfort	1
in	1
mine	1
Believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
deceived	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
You	1
have	1
now	1
done	1
your	1
duty	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
must	1
fret	1
no	1
longer	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
can	1
I	1
be	1
happy	1
even	1
supposing	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
accepting	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
sisters	1
and	1
friends	1
are	1
all	1
wishing	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
elsewhere	1
You	1
must	1
decide	1
for	1
yourself	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
if	1
upon	1
mature	1
deliberation	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
disobliging	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
equivalent	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
being	1
his	1
wife	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
to	1
refuse	1
him	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so	1
said	1
Jane	1
faintly	1
smiling	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
grieved	1
at	1
their	1
disapprobation	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
hesitate	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
I	1
cannot	1
consider	1
your	1
situation	1
with	1
much	1
compassion	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
returns	1
no	1
more	1
this	1
winter	1
my	1
choice	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
required	1
A	1
thousand	1
things	1
may	1
arise	1
in	1
six	1
months	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
returning	1
no	1
more	1
Elizabeth	1
treated	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
contempt	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
merely	1
the	1
suggestion	1
of	1
Caroline	1
s	1
interested	1
wishes	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
suppose	1
that	1
those	1
wishes	1
however	1
openly	1
or	1
artfully	1
spoken	1
could	1
influence	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
so	1
totally	1
independent	1
of	1
everyone	1
She	1
represented	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
as	1
forcibly	1
as	1
possible	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
had	1
soon	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
its	1
happy	1
effect	1
Jane	1
s	1
temper	1
was	1
not	1
desponding	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
to	1
hope	1
though	1
the	1
diffidence	1
of	1
affection	1
sometimes	1
overcame	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
Bingley	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
answer	1
every	1
wish	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
They	1
agreed	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
should	1
only	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
without	1
being	1
alarmed	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
s	1
conduct	1
but	1
even	1
this	1
partial	1
communication	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
concern	1
and	1
she	1
bewailed	1
it	1
as	1
exceedingly	1
unlucky	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
getting	1
so	1
intimate	1
together	1
After	1
lamenting	1
it	1
however	1
at	1
some	1
length	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
consolation	1
that	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
soon	1
dining	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
and	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
comfortable	1
declaration	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
invited	1
only	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
she	1
would	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
full	1
courses	1
Chapter	1
22	1
The	1
Bennets	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
Lucases	1
and	1
again	1
during	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
thanking	1
her	1
It	1
keeps	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
said	1
she	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
express	1
Charlotte	1
assured	1
her	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
being	1
useful	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
amply	1
repaid	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
her	1
time	1
This	1
was	1
very	1
amiable	1
but	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
kindness	1
extended	1
farther	1
than	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
any	1
conception	1
of	1
its	1
object	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
than	1
to	1
secure	1
her	1
from	1
any	1
return	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
addresses	1
by	1
engaging	1
them	1
towards	1
herself	1
Such	1
was	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
s	1
scheme	1
and	1
appearances	1
were	1
so	1
favourable	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
parted	1
at	1
night	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
almost	1
secure	1
of	1
success	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
leave	1
Hertfordshire	1
so	1
very	1
soon	1
But	1
here	1
she	1
did	1
injustice	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
independence	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
for	1
it	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
House	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
with	1
admirable	1
slyness	1
and	1
hasten	1
to	1
Lucas	1
Lodge	1
to	1
throw	1
himself	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
He	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
cousins	1
from	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
depart	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
conjecture	1
his	1
design	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
attempt	1
known	1
till	1
its	1
success	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
likewise	1
for	1
though	1
feeling	1
almost	1
secure	1
and	1
with	1
reason	1
for	1
Charlotte	1
had	1
been	1
tolerably	1
encouraging	1
he	1
was	1
comparatively	1
diffident	1
since	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
Wednesday	1
His	1
reception	1
however	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
flattering	1
kind	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
perceived	1
him	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
window	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
instantly	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
accidentally	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
But	1
little	1
had	1
she	1
dared	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
love	1
and	1
eloquence	1
awaited	1
her	1
there	1
In	1
as	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
long	1
speeches	1
would	1
allow	1
everything	1
was	1
settled	1
between	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
both	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
earnestly	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
name	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
though	1
such	1
a	1
solicitation	1
must	1
be	1
waived	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
the	1
lady	1
felt	1
no	1
inclination	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
his	1
happiness	1
The	1
stupidity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
favoured	1
by	1
nature	1
must	1
guard	1
his	1
courtship	1
from	1
any	1
charm	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
woman	1
wish	1
for	1
its	1
continuance	1
and	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
who	1
accepted	1
him	1
solely	1
from	1
the	1
pure	1
and	1
disinterested	1
desire	1
of	1
an	1
establishment	1
cared	1
not	1
how	1
soon	1
that	1
establishment	1
were	1
gained	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
were	1
speedily	1
applied	1
to	1
for	1
their	1
consent	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
bestowed	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
joyful	1
alacrity	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
present	1
circumstances	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
match	1
for	1
their	1
daughter	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
give	1
little	1
fortune	1
and	1
his	1
prospects	1
of	1
future	1
wealth	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
fair	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
began	1
directly	1
to	1
calculate	1
with	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
the	1
matter	1
had	1
ever	1
excited	1
before	1
how	1
many	1
years	1
longer	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
Sir	1
William	1
gave	1
it	1
as	1
his	1
decided	1
opinion	1
that	1
whenever	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
expedient	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
make	1
their	1
appearance	1
at	1
St	1
James	1
s	1
The	1
whole	1
family	1
in	1
short	1
were	1
properly	1
overjoyed	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
The	1
younger	1
girls	1
formed	1
hopes	1
of	1
coming	1
out	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
sooner	1
than	1
they	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
done	1
and	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
relieved	1
from	1
their	1
apprehension	1
of	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
dying	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
Charlotte	1
herself	1
was	1
tolerably	1
composed	1
She	1
had	1
gained	1
her	1
point	1
and	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
it	1
Her	1
reflections	1
were	1
in	1
general	1
satisfactory	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
was	1
neither	1
sensible	1
nor	1
agreeable	1
his	1
society	1
was	1
irksome	1
and	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
her	1
must	1
be	1
imaginary	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
Without	1
thinking	1
highly	1
either	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
matrimony	1
marriage	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
her	1
object	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
provision	1
for	1
well	1
educated	1
young	1
women	1
of	1
small	1
fortune	1
and	1
however	1
uncertain	1
of	1
giving	1
happiness	1
must	1
be	1
their	1
pleasantest	1
preservative	1
from	1
want	1
This	1
preservative	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
obtained	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twenty	1
seven	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
been	1
handsome	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
luck	1
of	1
it	1
The	1
least	1
agreeable	1
circumstance	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
the	1
surprise	1
it	1
must	1
occasion	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
whose	1
friendship	1
she	1
valued	1
beyond	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
wonder	1
and	1
probably	1
would	1
blame	1
her	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
resolution	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
her	1
feelings	1
must	1
be	1
hurt	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
disapprobation	1
She	1
resolved	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
information	1
herself	1
and	1
therefore	1
charged	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
to	1
dinner	1
to	1
drop	1
no	1
hint	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
A	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
very	1
dutifully	1
given	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
without	1
difficulty	1
for	1
the	1
curiosity	1
excited	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
absence	1
burst	1
forth	1
in	1
such	1
very	1
direct	1
questions	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
as	1
required	1
some	1
ingenuity	1
to	1
evade	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
exercising	1
great	1
self	1
denial	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
publish	1
his	1
prosperous	1
love	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
journey	1
too	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
leave	1
taking	1
was	1
performed	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
moved	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
and	1
cordiality	1
said	1
how	1
happy	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
again	1
whenever	1
his	1
engagements	1
might	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
them	1
My	1
dear	1
madam	1
he	1
replied	1
this	1
invitation	1
is	1
particularly	1
gratifying	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
hoping	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
astonished	1
and	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
who	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
wish	1
for	1
so	1
speedy	1
a	1
return	1
immediately	1
said	1
But	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
danger	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
disapprobation	1
here	1
my	1
good	1
sir	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
neglect	1
your	1
relations	1
than	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
offending	1
your	1
patroness	1
My	1
dear	1
sir	1
replied	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
this	1
friendly	1
caution	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
not	1
taking	1
so	1
material	1
a	1
step	1
without	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
concurrence	1
You	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
your	1
guard	1
Risk	1
anything	1
rather	1
than	1
her	1
displeasure	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
by	1
your	1
coming	1
to	1
us	1
again	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
exceedingly	1
probable	1
stay	1
quietly	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
offence	1
Believe	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
my	1
gratitude	1
is	1
warmly	1
excited	1
by	1
such	1
affectionate	1
attention	1
and	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
you	1
will	1
speedily	1
receive	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
for	1
every	1
other	1
mark	1
of	1
your	1
regard	1
during	1
my	1
stay	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
As	1
for	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
though	1
my	1
absence	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
necessary	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
take	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
wishing	1
them	1
health	1
and	1
happiness	1
not	1
excepting	1
my	1
cousin	1
Elizabeth	1
With	1
proper	1
civilities	1
the	1
ladies	1
then	1
withdrew	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
equally	1
surprised	1
that	1
he	1
meditated	1
a	1
quick	1
return	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
wished	1
to	1
understand	1
by	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
paying	1
his	1
addresses	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
younger	1
girls	1
and	1
Mary	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
accept	1
him	1
She	1
rated	1
his	1
abilities	1
much	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
solidity	1
in	1
his	1
reflections	1
which	1
often	1
struck	1
her	1
and	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
clever	1
as	1
herself	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
encouraged	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
improve	1
himself	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
example	1
as	1
hers	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
companion	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
was	1
done	1
away	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
called	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
private	1
conference	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
related	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
fancying	1
himself	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
once	1
occurred	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
but	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
could	1
encourage	1
him	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
possibility	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
encourage	1
him	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
astonishment	1
was	1
consequently	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
overcome	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
decorum	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
crying	1
out	1
Engaged	1
to	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
My	1
dear	1
Charlotte	1
impossible	1
The	1
steady	1
countenance	1
which	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
had	1
commanded	1
in	1
telling	1
her	1
story	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
momentary	1
confusion	1
here	1
on	1
receiving	1
so	1
direct	1
a	1
reproach	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
expected	1
she	1
soon	1
regained	1
her	1
composure	1
and	1
calmly	1
replied	1
Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
surprised	1
my	1
dear	1
Eliza	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
incredible	1
that	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
procure	1
any	1
woman	1
s	1
good	1
opinion	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
happy	1
as	1
to	1
succeed	1
with	1
you	1
But	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
now	1
recollected	1
herself	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
strong	1
effort	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
assure	1
with	1
tolerable	1
firmness	1
that	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
relationship	1
was	1
highly	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
her	1
all	1
imaginable	1
happiness	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
feeling	1
replied	1
Charlotte	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
surprised	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
so	1
lately	1
as	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
wishing	1
to	1
marry	1
you	1
But	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
romantic	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
never	1
was	1
I	1
ask	1
only	1
a	1
comfortable	1
home	1
and	1
considering	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
character	1
connection	1
and	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
my	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness	1
with	1
him	1
is	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
most	1
people	1
can	1
boast	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
marriage	1
state	1
Elizabeth	1
quietly	1
answered	1
Undoubtedly	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
awkward	1
pause	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
Charlotte	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
much	1
longer	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
then	1
left	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
became	1
at	1
all	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
so	1
unsuitable	1
a	1
match	1
The	1
strangeness	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
making	1
two	1
offers	1
of	1
marriage	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
now	1
accepted	1
She	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
opinion	1
of	1
matrimony	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
like	1
her	1
own	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
when	1
called	1
into	1
action	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
every	1
better	1
feeling	1
to	1
worldly	1
advantage	1
Charlotte	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
humiliating	1
picture	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
pang	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
disgracing	1
herself	1
and	1
sunk	1
in	1
her	1
esteem	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
distressing	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
that	1
friend	1
to	1
be	1
tolerably	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
lot	1
she	1
had	1
chosen	1
Chapter	1
23	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
reflecting	1
on	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
doubting	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
authorised	1
to	1
mention	1
it	1
when	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
himself	1
appeared	1
sent	1
by	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
engagement	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
With	1
many	1
compliments	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
much	1
self	1
gratulation	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
houses	1
he	1
unfolded	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
an	1
audience	1
not	1
merely	1
wondering	1
but	1
incredulous	1
for	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
with	1
more	1
perseverance	1
than	1
politeness	1
protested	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
entirely	1
mistaken	1
and	1
Lydia	1
always	1
unguarded	1
and	1
often	1
uncivil	1
boisterously	1
exclaimed	1
Good	1
Lord	1
Sir	1
William	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
such	1
a	1
story	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
wants	1
to	1
marry	1
Lizzy	1
Nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
complaisance	1
of	1
a	1
courtier	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
without	1
anger	1
such	1
treatment	1
but	1
Sir	1
William	1
s	1
good	1
breeding	1
carried	1
him	1
through	1
it	1
all	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
begged	1
leave	1
to	1
be	1
positive	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
information	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
impertinence	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
forbearing	1
courtesy	1
Elizabeth	1
feeling	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
from	1
so	1
unpleasant	1
a	1
situation	1
now	1
put	1
herself	1
forward	1
to	1
confirm	1
his	1
account	1
by	1
mentioning	1
her	1
prior	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
Charlotte	1
herself	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
exclamations	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
by	1
the	1
earnestness	1
of	1
her	1
congratulations	1
to	1
Sir	1
William	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
readily	1
joined	1
by	1
Jane	1
and	1
by	1
making	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
remarks	1
on	1
the	1
happiness	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
match	1
the	1
excellent	1
character	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
the	1
convenient	1
distance	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
from	1
London	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
too	1
much	1
overpowered	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
while	1
Sir	1
William	1
remained	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
them	1
than	1
her	1
feelings	1
found	1
a	1
rapid	1
vent	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
she	1
persisted	1
in	1
disbelieving	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
secondly	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
thirdly	1
she	1
trusted	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
happy	1
together	1
and	1
fourthly	1
that	1
the	1
match	1
might	1
be	1
broken	1
off	1
Two	1
inferences	1
however	1
were	1
plainly	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
one	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
mischief	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
been	1
barbarously	1
misused	1
by	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
two	1
points	1
she	1
principally	1
dwelt	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
Nothing	1
could	1
console	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
appease	1
her	1
Nor	1
did	1
that	1
day	1
wear	1
out	1
her	1
resentment	1
A	1
week	1
elapsed	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
Elizabeth	1
without	1
scolding	1
her	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
away	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
Sir	1
William	1
or	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
without	1
being	1
rude	1
and	1
many	1
months	1
were	1
gone	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
forgive	1
their	1
daughter	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
s	1
emotions	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
tranquil	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
experience	1
he	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
agreeable	1
sort	1
for	1
it	1
gratified	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
tolerably	1
sensible	1
was	1
as	1
foolish	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
more	1
foolish	1
than	1
his	1
daughter	1
Jane	1
confessed	1
herself	1
a	1
little	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
match	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
less	1
of	1
her	1
astonishment	1
than	1
of	1
her	1
earnest	1
desire	1
for	1
their	1
happiness	1
nor	1
could	1
Elizabeth	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
improbable	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
envying	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
for	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
clergyman	1
and	1
it	1
affected	1
them	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
to	1
spread	1
at	1
Meryton	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
insensible	1
of	1
triumph	1
on	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
retort	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
daughter	1
well	1
married	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
rather	1
oftener	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
was	1
though	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
sour	1
looks	1
and	1
ill	1
natured	1
remarks	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
drive	1
happiness	1
away	1
Between	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
restraint	1
which	1
kept	1
them	1
mutually	1
silent	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
that	1
no	1
real	1
confidence	1
could	1
ever	1
subsist	1
between	1
them	1
again	1
Her	1
disappointment	1
in	1
Charlotte	1
made	1
her	1
turn	1
with	1
fonder	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
of	1
whose	1
rectitude	1
and	1
delicacy	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
her	1
opinion	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
shaken	1
and	1
for	1
whose	1
happiness	1
she	1
grew	1
daily	1
more	1
anxious	1
as	1
Bingley	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
gone	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
return	1
Jane	1
had	1
sent	1
Caroline	1
an	1
early	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
letter	1
and	1
was	1
counting	1
the	1
days	1
till	1
she	1
might	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
hear	1
again	1
The	1
promised	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
from	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
arrived	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
addressed	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
written	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
gratitude	1
which	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
s	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
might	1
have	1
prompted	1
After	1
discharging	1
his	1
conscience	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
with	1
many	1
rapturous	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
having	1
obtained	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
their	1
amiable	1
neighbour	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
and	1
then	1
explained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
enjoying	1
her	1
society	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
close	1
with	1
their	1
kind	1
wish	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
again	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
whither	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
return	1
on	1
Monday	1
fortnight	1
for	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
he	1
added	1
so	1
heartily	1
approved	1
his	1
marriage	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unanswerable	1
argument	1
with	1
his	1
amiable	1
Charlotte	1
to	1
name	1
an	1
early	1
day	1
for	1
making	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
return	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
disposed	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
instead	1
of	1
to	1
Lucas	1
Lodge	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
very	1
inconvenient	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
troublesome	1
She	1
hated	1
having	1
visitors	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
while	1
her	1
health	1
was	1
so	1
indifferent	1
and	1
lovers	1
were	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
the	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
gentle	1
murmurs	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
way	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
distress	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
continued	1
absence	1
Neither	1
Jane	1
nor	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
comfortable	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
Day	1
after	1
day	1
passed	1
away	1
without	1
bringing	1
any	1
other	1
tidings	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
shortly	1
prevailed	1
in	1
Meryton	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
the	1
whole	1
winter	1
a	1
report	1
which	1
highly	1
incensed	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
contradict	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
scandalous	1
falsehood	1
Even	1
Elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
not	1
that	1
Bingley	1
was	1
indifferent	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
sisters	1
would	1
be	1
successful	1
in	1
keeping	1
him	1
away	1
Unwilling	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
admit	1
an	1
idea	1
so	1
destructive	1
of	1
Jane	1
s	1
happiness	1
and	1
so	1
dishonorable	1
to	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
prevent	1
its	1
frequently	1
occurring	1
The	1
united	1
efforts	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
unfeeling	1
sisters	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
overpowering	1
friend	1
assisted	1
by	1
the	1
attractions	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
and	1
the	1
amusements	1
of	1
London	1
might	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
she	1
feared	1
for	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
attachment	1
As	1
for	1
Jane	1
her	1
anxiety	1
under	1
this	1
suspense	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
more	1
painful	1
than	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
but	1
whatever	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
desirous	1
of	1
concealing	1
and	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
therefore	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
never	1
alluded	1
to	1
But	1
as	1
no	1
such	1
delicacy	1
restrained	1
her	1
mother	1
an	1
hour	1
seldom	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
Bingley	1
express	1
her	1
impatience	1
for	1
his	1
arrival	1
or	1
even	1
require	1
Jane	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
she	1
would	1
think	1
herself	1
very	1
ill	1
used	1
It	1
needed	1
all	1
Jane	1
s	1
steady	1
mildness	1
to	1
bear	1
these	1
attacks	1
with	1
tolerable	1
tranquillity	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
returned	1
most	1
punctually	1
on	1
Monday	1
fortnight	1
but	1
his	1
reception	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
gracious	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
introduction	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
happy	1
however	1
to	1
need	1
much	1
attention	1
and	1
luckily	1
for	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
love	1
making	1
relieved	1
them	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
company	1
The	1
chief	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
Lucas	1
Lodge	1
and	1
he	1
sometimes	1
returned	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
only	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
his	1
absence	1
before	1
the	1
family	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
pitiable	1
state	1
The	1
very	1
mention	1
of	1
anything	1
concerning	1
the	1
match	1
threw	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
ill	1
humour	1
and	1
wherever	1
she	1
went	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
hearing	1
it	1
talked	1
of	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
was	1
odious	1
to	1
her	1
As	1
her	1
successor	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
she	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
jealous	1
abhorrence	1
Whenever	1
Charlotte	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
she	1
concluded	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
anticipating	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
possession	1
and	1
whenever	1
she	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
and	1
resolving	1
to	1
turn	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
were	1
dead	1
She	1
complained	1
bitterly	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
Indeed	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
said	1
she	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
mistress	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
it	1
My	1
dear	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
Let	1
us	1
hope	1
for	1
better	1
things	1
Let	1
us	1
flatter	1
ourselves	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
survivor	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
consoling	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
therefore	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
answer	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
before	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
all	1
this	1
estate	1
If	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
entail	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
it	1
What	1
should	1
not	1
you	1
mind	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
thankful	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
preserved	1
from	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
such	1
insensibility	1
I	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
thankful	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
for	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
entail	1
How	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
conscience	1
to	1
entail	1
away	1
an	1
estate	1
from	1
one	1
s	1
own	1
daughters	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
too	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
anybody	1
else	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
yourself	1
to	1
determine	1

Chapter	1
24	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
letter	1
arrived	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
doubt	1
The	1
very	1
first	1
sentence	1
conveyed	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
all	1
settled	1
in	1
London	1
for	1
the	1
winter	1
and	1
concluded	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
regret	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
before	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
country	1
Hope	1
was	1
over	1
entirely	1
over	1
and	1
when	1
Jane	1
could	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
found	1
little	1
except	1
the	1
professed	1
affection	1
of	1
the	1
writer	1
that	1
could	1
give	1
her	1
any	1
comfort	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
s	1
praise	1
occupied	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
it	1
Her	1
many	1
attractions	1
were	1
again	1
dwelt	1
on	1
and	1
Caroline	1
boasted	1
joyfully	1
of	1
their	1
increasing	1
intimacy	1
and	1
ventured	1
to	1
predict	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
wishes	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
unfolded	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
letter	1
She	1
wrote	1
also	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
being	1
an	1
inmate	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
mentioned	1
with	1
raptures	1
some	1
plans	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
new	1
furniture	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
whom	1
Jane	1
very	1
soon	1
communicated	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
heard	1
it	1
in	1
silent	1
indignation	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
concern	1
for	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
resentment	1
against	1
all	1
others	1
To	1
Caroline	1
s	1
assertion	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
s	1
being	1
partial	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
she	1
paid	1
no	1
credit	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
fond	1
of	1
Jane	1
she	1
doubted	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
and	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
disposed	1
to	1
like	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
anger	1
hardly	1
without	1
contempt	1
on	1
that	1
easiness	1
of	1
temper	1
that	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
resolution	1
which	1
now	1
made	1
him	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
his	1
designing	1
friends	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
to	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
their	1
inclination	1
Had	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
however	1
been	1
the	1
only	1
sacrifice	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
sport	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
whatever	1
manner	1
he	1
thought	1
best	1
but	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
was	1
involved	1
in	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
sensible	1
himself	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
in	1
short	1
on	1
which	1
reflection	1
would	1
be	1
long	1
indulged	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
unavailing	1
She	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
and	1
yet	1
whether	1
Bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
had	1
really	1
died	1
away	1
or	1
were	1
suppressed	1
by	1
his	1
friends	1
interference	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
aware	1
of	1
Jane	1
s	1
attachment	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
observation	1
whatever	1
were	1
the	1
case	1
though	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
must	1
be	1
materially	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
difference	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
situation	1
remained	1
the	1
same	1
her	1
peace	1
equally	1
wounded	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
passed	1
before	1
Jane	1
had	1
courage	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
on	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
leaving	1
them	1
together	1
after	1
a	1
longer	1
irritation	1
than	1
usual	1
about	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
its	1
master	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
Oh	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
mother	1
had	1
more	1
command	1
over	1
herself	1
She	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
she	1
gives	1
me	1
by	1
her	1
continual	1
reflections	1
on	1
him	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
repine	1
It	1
cannot	1
last	1
long	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
forgot	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
before	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
with	1
incredulous	1
solicitude	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
You	1
doubt	1
me	1
cried	1
Jane	1
slightly	1
colouring	1
indeed	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
He	1
may	1
live	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
man	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
either	1
to	1
hope	1
or	1
fear	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
him	1
with	1
Thank	1
God	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
that	1
pain	1
A	1
little	1
time	1
therefore	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
With	1
a	1
stronger	1
voice	1
she	1
soon	1
added	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
comfort	1
immediately	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
error	1
of	1
fancy	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
but	1
myself	1
My	1
dear	1
Jane	1
exclaimed	1
Elizabeth	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
good	1
Your	1
sweetness	1
and	1
disinterestedness	1
are	1
really	1
angelic	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
done	1
you	1
justice	1
or	1
loved	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
deserve	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
eagerly	1
disclaimed	1
all	1
extraordinary	1
merit	1
and	1
threw	1
back	1
the	1
praise	1
on	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
warm	1
affection	1
Nay	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
fair	1
You	1
wish	1
to	1
think	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
respectable	1
and	1
are	1
hurt	1
if	1
I	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
anybody	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
perfect	1
and	1
you	1
set	1
yourself	1
against	1
it	1
Do	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
my	1
running	1
into	1
any	1
excess	1
of	1
my	1
encroaching	1
on	1
your	1
privilege	1
of	1
universal	1
good	1
will	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
There	1
are	1
few	1
people	1
whom	1
I	1
really	1
love	1
and	1
still	1
fewer	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
think	1
well	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
see	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
more	1
am	1
I	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
confirms	1
my	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
inconsistency	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
characters	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
dependence	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
merit	1
or	1
sense	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
two	1
instances	1
lately	1
one	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
mention	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
marriage	1
It	1
is	1
unaccountable	1
In	1
every	1
view	1
it	1
is	1
unaccountable	1
My	1
dear	1
Lizzy	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
feelings	1
as	1
these	1
They	1
will	1
ruin	1
your	1
happiness	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
allowance	1
enough	1
for	1
difference	1
of	1
situation	1
and	1
temper	1
Consider	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
respectability	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
steady	1
prudent	1
character	1
Remember	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
family	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
fortune	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
match	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
for	1
everybody	1
s	1
sake	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
feel	1
something	1
like	1
regard	1
and	1
esteem	1
for	1
our	1
cousin	1
To	1
oblige	1
you	1
I	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
believe	1
almost	1
anything	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
be	1
benefited	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
belief	1
as	1
this	1
for	1
were	1
I	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
had	1
any	1
regard	1
for	1
him	1
I	1
should	1
only	1
think	1
worse	1
of	1
her	1
understanding	1
than	1
I	1
now	1
do	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
My	1
dear	1
Jane	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
is	1
a	1
conceited	1
pompous	1
narrow	1
minded	1
silly	1
man	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
married	1
him	1
cannot	1
have	1
a	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
thinking	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
defend	1
her	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
individual	1
change	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
principle	1
and	1
integrity	1
nor	1
endeavour	1
to	1
persuade	1
yourself	1
or	1
me	1
that	1
selfishness	1
is	1
prudence	1
and	1
insensibility	1
of	1
danger	1
security	1
for	1
happiness	1
I	1
must	1
think	1
your	1
language	1
too	1
strong	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
both	1
replied	1
Jane	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
seeing	1
them	1
happy	1
together	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
You	1
alluded	1
to	1
something	1
else	1
You	1
mentioned	1
two	1
instances	1
I	1
cannot	1
misunderstand	1
you	1
but	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
dear	1
Lizzy	1
not	1
to	1
pain	1
me	1
by	1
thinking	1
that	1
person	1
to	1
blame	1
and	1
saying	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
sunk	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
fancy	1
ourselves	1
intentionally	1
injured	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
a	1
lively	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
so	1
guarded	1
and	1
circumspect	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
often	1
nothing	1
but	1
our	1
own	1
vanity	1
that	1
deceives	1
us	1
Women	1
fancy	1
admiration	1
means	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
does	1
And	1
men	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
designedly	1
done	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
justified	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
design	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
some	1
persons	1
imagine	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
attributing	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
conduct	1
to	1
design	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
but	1
without	1
scheming	1
to	1
do	1
wrong	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
others	1
unhappy	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
error	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
misery	1
Thoughtlessness	1
want	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
s	1
feelings	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
resolution	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
business	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
impute	1
it	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
those	1
Yes	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
on	1
I	1
shall	1
displease	1
you	1
by	1
saying	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
persons	1
you	1
esteem	1
Stop	1
me	1
whilst	1
you	1
can	1
You	1
persist	1
then	1
in	1
supposing	1
his	1
sisters	1
influence	1
him	1
Yes	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it	1
Why	1
should	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
influence	1
him	1
They	1
can	1
only	1
wish	1
his	1
happiness	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
no	1
other	1
woman	1
can	1
secure	1
it	1
Your	1
first	1
position	1
is	1
false	1
They	1
may	1
wish	1
many	1
things	1
besides	1
his	1
happiness	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
his	1
increase	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
consequence	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
money	1
great	1
connections	1
and	1
pride	1
Beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
they	1
do	1
wish	1
him	1
to	1
choose	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
replied	1
Jane	1
but	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
from	1
better	1
feelings	1
than	1
you	1
are	1
supposing	1
They	1
have	1
known	1
her	1
much	1
longer	1
than	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
me	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
they	1
love	1
her	1
better	1
But	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
own	1
wishes	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
unlikely	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
opposed	1
their	1
brother	1
s	1
What	1
sister	1
would	1
think	1
herself	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
unless	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
very	1
objectionable	1
If	1
they	1
believed	1
him	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
part	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
so	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
succeed	1
By	1
supposing	1
such	1
an	1
affection	1
you	1
make	1
everybody	1
acting	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
wrong	1
and	1
me	1
most	1
unhappy	1
Do	1
not	1
distress	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
mistaken	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
is	1
light	1
it	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
in	1
thinking	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
his	1
sisters	1
Let	1
me	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
understood	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
a	1
wish	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
name	1
was	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
mentioned	1
between	1
them	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
wonder	1
and	1
repine	1
at	1
his	1
returning	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
day	1
seldom	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
it	1
clearly	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
chance	1
of	1
her	1
ever	1
considering	1
it	1
with	1
less	1
perplexity	1
Her	1
daughter	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
convince	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
herself	1
that	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
Jane	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
and	1
transient	1
liking	1
which	1
ceased	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
statement	1
was	1
admitted	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
story	1
to	1
repeat	1
every	1
day	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
s	1
best	1
comfort	1
was	1
that	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
must	1
be	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
treated	1
the	1
matter	1
differently	1
So	1
Lizzy	1
said	1
he	1
one	1
day	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
crossed	1
in	1
love	1
I	1
find	1
I	1
congratulate	1
her	1
Next	1
to	1
being	1
married	1
a	1
girl	1
likes	1
to	1
be	1
crossed	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
love	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
it	1
gives	1
her	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
distinction	1
among	1
her	1
companions	1
When	1
is	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
come	1
You	1
will	1
hardly	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
long	1
outdone	1
by	1
Jane	1
Now	1
is	1
your	1
time	1
Here	1
are	1
officers	1
enough	1
in	1
Meryton	1
to	1
disappoint	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
Let	1
Wickham	1
be	1
your	1
man	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
pleasant	1
fellow	1
and	1
would	1
jilt	1
you	1
creditably	1
Thank	1
you	1
sir	1
but	1
a	1
less	1
agreeable	1
man	1
would	1
satisfy	1
me	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
all	1
expect	1
Jane	1
s	1
good	1
fortune	1
True	1
said	1
Mr	1
Bennet	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
whatever	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
may	1
befall	1
you	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
affectionate	1
mother	1
who	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
s	1
society	1
was	1
of	1
material	1
service	1
in	1
dispelling	1
the	1
gloom	1
which	1
the	1
late	1
perverse	1
occurrences	1
had	1
thrown	1
on	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family	1
They	1
saw	1
him	1
often	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
other	1
recommendations	1
was	1
now	1
added	1
that	1
of	1
general	1
unreserve	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
what	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
his	1
claims	1
on	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
now	1
openly	1
acknowledged	1
and	1
publicly	1
canvassed	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
had	1
always	1
disliked	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
who	1
could	1
suppose	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
any	1
extenuating	1
circumstances	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
Hertfordshire	1
her	1
mild	1
and	1
steady	1
candour	1
always	1
pleaded	1
for	1
allowances	1
and	1
urged	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistakes	1
but	1
by	1
everybody	1
else	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
was	1
condemned	1
as	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
men	1
Chapter	1

After	1
a	1
week	1
spent	1
in	1
professions	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
schemes	1
of	1
felicity	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
called	1
from	1
his	1
amiable	1
Charlotte	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
Saturday	1
The	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
however	1
might	1
be	1
alleviated	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
by	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
bride	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
the	1
day	1
would	1
be	1
fixed	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men	1
He	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
solemnity	1
as	1
before	1
wished	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins	1
health	1
and	1
happiness	1
again	1
and	1
promised	1
their	1
father	1
another	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
On	1
the	1
following	1
Monday	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
receiving	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
who	1
came	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
Christmas	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
Mr	1
Gardiner	1
was	1
a	1
sensible	1
gentlemanlike	1
man	1
greatly	1
superior	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
nature	1
as	1
education	1
The	1
Netherfield	1
ladies	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
by	1
trade	1
and	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
warehouses	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
well	1
bred	1
and	1
agreeable	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
who	1
was	1
several	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Phillips	1
was	1
an	1
amiable	1
intelligent	1
elegant	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
Longbourn	1
nieces	1
Between	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
and	1
herself	1
especially	1
there	1
subsisted	1
a	1
particular	1
regard	1
They	1
had	1
frequently	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
town	1
The	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
s	1
business	1
on	1
her	1
arrival	1
was	1
to	1
distribute	1
her	1
presents	1
and	1
describe	1
the	1
newest	1
fashions	1
When	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
less	1
active	1
part	1
to	1
play	1
It	1
became	1
her	1
turn	1
to	1
listen	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
many	1
grievances	1
to	1
relate	1
and	1
much	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
very	1
ill	1
used	1
since	1
she	1
last	1
saw	1
her	1
sister	1
Two	1
of	1
her	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
marriage	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
Jane	1
she	1
continued	1
for	1
Jane	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
But	1
Lizzy	1
Oh	1
sister	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
wife	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
perverseness	1
He	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
room	1
and	1
she	1
refused	1
him	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
married	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
entailed	1
as	1
ever	1
The	1
Lucases	1
are	1
very	1
artful	1
people	1
indeed	1
sister	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
can	1
get	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
It	1
makes	1
me	1
very	1
nervous	1
and	1
poorly	1
to	1
be	1
thwarted	1
so	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
family	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
neighbours	1
who	1
think	1
of	1
themselves	1
before	1
anybody	1
else	1
However	1
your	1
coming	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
comforts	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
long	1
sleeves	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
correspondence	1
with	1
her	1
made	1
her	1
sister	1
a	1
slight	1
answer	1
and	1
in	1
compassion	1
to	1
her	1
nieces	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
When	1
alone	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
afterwards	1
she	1
spoke	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
It	1
seems	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
desirable	1
match	1
for	1
Jane	1
said	1
she	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
it	1
went	1
off	1
But	1
these	1
things	1
happen	1
so	1
often	1
A	1
young	1
man	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
describe	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
so	1
easily	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
and	1
when	1
accident	1
separates	1
them	1
so	1
easily	1
forgets	1
her	1
that	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
inconsistencies	1
are	1
very	1
frequent	1
An	1
excellent	1
consolation	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
suffer	1
by	1
accident	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
friends	1
will	1
persuade	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
independent	1
fortune	1
to	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
violently	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
But	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
violently	1
in	1
love	1
is	1
so	1
hackneyed	1
so	1
doubtful	1
so	1
indefinite	1
that	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
very	1
little	1
idea	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
often	1
applied	1
to	1
feelings	1
which	1
arise	1
from	1
a	1
half	1
hour	1
s	1
acquaintance	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
real	1
strong	1
attachment	1
Pray	1
how	1
violent	1
was	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
s	1
love	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
promising	1
inclination	1
he	1
was	1
growing	1
quite	1
inattentive	1
to	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
Every	1
time	1
they	1
met	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
decided	1
and	1
remarkable	1
At	1
his	1
own	1
ball	1
he	1
offended	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
by	1
not	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
dance	1
and	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
twice	1
myself	1
without	1
receiving	1
an	1
answer	1
Could	1
there	1
be	1
finer	1
symptoms	1
Is	1
not	1
general	1
incivility	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
love	1
Oh	1
yes	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
I	1
suppose	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
felt	1
Poor	1
Jane	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
because	1
with	1
her	1
disposition	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
immediately	1
It	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
Lizzy	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
laughed	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
sooner	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
us	1
Change	1
of	1
scene	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
and	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
relief	1
from	1
home	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
useful	1
as	1
anything	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
proposal	1
and	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
ready	1
acquiescence	1
I	1
hope	1
added	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
that	1
no	1
consideration	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
will	1
influence	1
her	1
We	1
live	1
in	1
so	1
different	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
town	1
all	1
our	1
connections	1
are	1
so	1
different	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
so	1
little	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
improbable	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
meet	1
at	1
all	1
unless	1
he	1
really	1
comes	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
Jane	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
London	1
My	1
dear	1
aunt	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
may	1
perhaps	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
Gracechurch	1
Street	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
hardly	1
think	1
a	1
month	1
s	1
ablution	1
enough	1
to	1
cleanse	1
him	1
from	1
its	1
impurities	1
were	1
he	1
once	1
to	1
enter	1
it	1
and	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
never	1
stirs	1
without	1
him	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
I	1
hope	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
at	1
all	1
But	1
does	1
not	1
Jane	1
correspond	1
with	1
his	1
sister	1
She	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
help	1
calling	1
She	1
will	1
drop	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
entirely	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
certainty	1
in	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
affected	1
to	1
place	1
this	1
point	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
one	1
of	1
Bingley	1
s	1
being	1
withheld	1
from	1
seeing	1
Jane	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
solicitude	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
convinced	1
her	1
on	1
examination	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
entirely	1
hopeless	1
It	1
was	1
possible	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
his	1
affection	1
might	1
be	1
reanimated	1
and	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
successfully	1
combated	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
natural	1
influence	1
of	1
Jane	1
s	1
attractions	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
accepted	1
her	1
aunt	1
s	1
invitation	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
were	1
no	1
otherwise	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
than	1
as	1
she	1
hoped	1
by	1
Caroline	1
s	1
not	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
she	1
might	1
occasionally	1
spend	1
a	1
morning	1
with	1
her	1
without	1
any	1
danger	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
The	1
Gardiners	1
stayed	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
Phillipses	1
the	1
Lucases	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
without	1
its	1
engagement	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
had	1
so	1
carefully	1
provided	1
for	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
When	1
the	1
engagement	1
was	1
for	1
home	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
always	1
made	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
of	1
which	1
officers	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
occasions	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
rendered	1
suspicious	1
by	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
warm	1
commendation	1
narrowly	1
observed	1
them	1
both	1
Without	1
supposing	1
them	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
saw	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
seriously	1
in	1
love	1
their	1
preference	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
was	1
plain	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy	1
and	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
before	1
she	1
left	1
Hertfordshire	1
and	1
represent	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
encouraging	1
such	1
an	1
attachment	1
To	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
Wickham	1
had	1
one	1
means	1
of	1
affording	1
pleasure	1
unconnected	1
with	1
his	1
general	1
powers	1
About	1
ten	1
or	1
a	1
dozen	1
years	1
ago	1
before	1
her	1
marriage	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
part	1
of	1
Derbyshire	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
belonged	1
They	1
had	1
therefore	1
many	1
acquaintances	1
in	1
common	1
and	1
though	1
Wickham	1
had	1
been	1
little	1
there	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Darcy	1
s	1
father	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
fresher	1
intelligence	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
friends	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
procuring	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
had	1
seen	1
Pemberley	1
and	1
known	1
the	1
late	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
by	1
character	1
perfectly	1
well	1
Here	1
consequently	1
was	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
subject	1
of	1
discourse	1
In	1
comparing	1
her	1
recollection	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
with	1
the	1
minute	1
description	1
which	1
Wickham	1
could	1
give	1
and	1
in	1
bestowing	1
her	1
tribute	1
of	1
praise	1
on	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
its	1
late	1
possessor	1
she	1
was	1
delighting	1
both	1
him	1
and	1
herself	1
On	1
being	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
treatment	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
remember	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
gentleman	1
s	1
reputed	1
disposition	1
when	1
quite	1
a	1
lad	1
which	1
might	1
agree	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
confident	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
she	1
recollected	1
having	1
heard	1
Mr	1
Fitzwilliam	1
Darcy	1
formerly	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
proud	1
ill	1
natured	1
boy	1
Chapter	1
26	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
s	1
caution	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
punctually	1
and	1
kindly	1
given	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
favourable	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
alone	1
after	1
honestly	1
telling	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
thus	1
went	1
on	1
You	1
are	1
too	1
sensible	1
a	1
girl	1
Lizzy	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
merely	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
warned	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
speaking	1
openly	1
Seriously	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
guard	1
Do	1
not	1
involve	1
yourself	1
or	1
endeavour	1
to	1
involve	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
affection	1
which	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
fortune	1
would	1
make	1
so	1
very	1
imprudent	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
fortune	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
better	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
let	1
your	1
fancy	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
you	1
You	1
have	1
sense	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
Your	1
father	1
would	1
depend	1
on	1
your	1
resolution	1
and	1
good	1
conduct	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
disappoint	1
your	1
father	1
My	1
dear	1
aunt	1
this	1
is	1
being	1
serious	1
indeed	1
Yes	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
engage	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
serious	1
likewise	1
Well	1
then	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
under	1
any	1
alarm	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
of	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
too	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
prevent	1
it	1
Elizabeth	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
serious	1
now	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
again	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
no	1
I	1
certainly	1
am	1
not	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
man	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
becomes	1
really	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
it	1
Oh	1
that	1
abominable	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
My	1
father	1
s	1
opinion	1
of	1
me	1
does	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
honour	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
miserable	1
to	1
forfeit	1
it	1
My	1
father	1
however	1
is	1
partial	1
to	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
In	1
short	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
unhappy	1
but	1
since	1
we	1
see	1
every	1
day	1
that	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
affection	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
seldom	1
withheld	1
by	1
immediate	1
want	1
of	1
fortune	1
from	1
entering	1
into	1
engagements	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
be	1
wiser	1
than	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
or	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
even	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wisdom	1
to	1
resist	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
promise	1
you	1
therefore	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
believe	1
myself	1
his	1
first	1
object	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wishing	1
In	1
short	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
my	1
best	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
you	1
discourage	1
his	1
coming	1
here	1
so	1
very	1
often	1
At	1
least	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
remind	1
your	1
mother	1
of	1
inviting	1
him	1
As	1
I	1
did	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
a	1
conscious	1
smile	1
very	1
true	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
that	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
here	1
so	1
often	1
It	1
is	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
frequently	1
invited	1
this	1
week	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
mother	1
s	1
ideas	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
constant	1
company	1
for	1
her	1
friends	1
But	1
really	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
satisfied	1
Her	1
aunt	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
having	1
thanked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
hints	1
they	1
parted	1
a	1
wonderful	1
instance	1
of	1
advice	1
being	1
given	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
without	1
being	1
resented	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
returned	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
soon	1
after	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
quitted	1
by	1
the	1
Gardiners	1
and	1
Jane	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
abode	1
with	1
the	1
Lucases	1
his	1
arrival	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Bennet	1
His	1
marriage	1
was	1
now	1
fast	1
approaching	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
so	1
far	1
resigned	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
inevitable	1
and	1
even	1
repeatedly	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
an	1
ill	1
natured	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
happy	1
Thursday	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wedding	1
day	1
and	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
paid	1
her	1
farewell	1
visit	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
Elizabeth	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
ungracious	1
and	1
reluctant	1
good	1
wishes	1
and	1
sincerely	1
affected	1
herself	1
accompanied	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
downstairs	1
together	1
Charlotte	1
said	1
I	1
shall	1
depend	1
on	1
hearing	1
from	1
you	1
very	1
often	1
Eliza	1
That	1
you	1
certainly	1
shall	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
another	1
favour	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me	1
We	1
shall	1
often	1
meet	1
I	1
hope	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
leave	1
Kent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
Promise	1
me	1
therefore	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Hunsford	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
though	1
she	1
foresaw	1
little	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
visit	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
Maria	1
are	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
March	1
added	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
consent	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
Indeed	1
Eliza	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
welcome	1
as	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
The	1
wedding	1
took	1
place	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Kent	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
door	1
and	1
everybody	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
to	1
hear	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
usual	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
friend	1
and	1
their	1
correspondence	1
was	1
as	1
regular	1
and	1
frequent	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
equally	1
unreserved	1
was	1
impossible	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
never	1
address	1
her	1
without	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
intimacy	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
though	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
slacken	1
as	1
a	1
correspondent	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
rather	1
than	1
what	1
was	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
first	1
letters	1
were	1
received	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
eagerness	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
new	1
home	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
would	1
dare	1
pronounce	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
though	1
when	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
read	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
expressed	1
herself	1
on	1
every	1
point	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
foreseen	1
She	1
wrote	1
cheerfully	1
seemed	1
surrounded	1
with	1
comforts	1
and	1
mentioned	1
nothing	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
praise	1
The	1
house	1
furniture	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
roads	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
her	1
taste	1
and	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
behaviour	1
was	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
obliging	1
It	1
was	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
picture	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
and	1
Rosings	1
rationally	1
softened	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
perceived	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
visit	1
there	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
rest	1
Jane	1
had	1
already	1
written	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
announce	1
their	1
safe	1
arrival	1
in	1
London	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
wrote	1
again	1
Elizabeth	1
hoped	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
Her	1
impatience	1
for	1
this	1
second	1
letter	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
rewarded	1
as	1
impatience	1
generally	1
is	1
Jane	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
week	1
in	1
town	1
without	1
either	1
seeing	1
or	1
hearing	1
from	1
Caroline	1
She	1
accounted	1
for	1
it	1
however	1
by	1
supposing	1
that	1
her	1
last	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
from	1
Longbourn	1
had	1
by	1
some	1
accident	1
been	1
lost	1
My	1
aunt	1
she	1
continued	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
morrow	1
into	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
calling	1
in	1
Grosvenor	1
Street	1
She	1
wrote	1
again	1
when	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
paid	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
Caroline	1
in	1
spirits	1
were	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
reproached	1
me	1
for	1
giving	1
her	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
London	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
therefore	1
my	1
last	1
letter	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
her	1
I	1
inquired	1
after	1
their	1
brother	1
of	1
course	1
He	1
was	1
well	1
but	1
so	1
much	1
engaged	1
with	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
that	1
they	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
saw	1
him	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
dinner	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
My	1
visit	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
as	1
Caroline	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Hurst	1
were	1
going	1
out	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
soon	1
here	1
Elizabeth	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
this	1
letter	1
It	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
accident	1
only	1
could	1
discover	1
to	1
Mr	1
Bingley	1
her	1
sister	1
s	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
Four	1
weeks	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
Jane	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
him	1
She	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
regret	1
it	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
blind	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
inattention	1
After	1
waiting	1
at	1
home	1
every	1
morning	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
and	1
inventing	1
every	1
evening	1
a	1
fresh	1
excuse	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
visitor	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
appear	1
but	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
stay	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
the	1
alteration	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
would	1
allow	1
Jane	1
to	1
deceive	1
herself	1
no	1
longer	1
The	1
letter	1
which	1
she	1
wrote	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
will	1
prove	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
My	1
dearest	1
Lizzy	1
will	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
triumphing	1
in	1
her	1
better	1
judgement	1
at	1
my	1
expense	1
when	1
I	1
confess	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
deceived	1
in	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
regard	1
for	1
me	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
though	1
the	1
event	1
has	1
proved	1
you	1
right	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
obstinate	1
if	1
I	1
still	1
assert	1
that	1
considering	1
what	1
her	1
behaviour	1
was	1
my	1
confidence	1
was	1
as	1
natural	1
as	1
your	1
suspicion	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
comprehend	1
her	1
reason	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
intimate	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
same	1
circumstances	1
were	1
to	1
happen	1
again	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
deceived	1
again	1
Caroline	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
my	1
visit	1
till	1
yesterday	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
note	1
not	1
a	1
line	1
did	1
I	1
receive	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
When	1
she	1
did	1
come	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
slight	1
formal	1
apology	1
for	1
not	1
calling	1
before	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
again	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
so	1
altered	1
a	1
creature	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
I	1
was	1
perfectly	1
resolved	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
no	1
longer	1
I	1
pity	1
though	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
blaming	1
her	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
wrong	1
in	1
singling	1
me	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
say	1
that	1
every	1
advance	1
to	1
intimacy	1
began	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
But	1
I	1
pity	1
her	1
because	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
acting	1
wrong	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
anxiety	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
explain	1
myself	1
farther	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
anxiety	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
needless	1
yet	1
if	1
she	1
feels	1
it	1
it	1
will	1
easily	1
account	1
for	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
so	1
deservedly	1
dear	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
whatever	1
anxiety	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
on	1
his	1
behalf	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
amiable	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
wonder	1
however	1
at	1
her	1
having	1
any	1
such	1
fears	1
now	1
because	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
all	1
cared	1
about	1
me	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
met	1
long	1
ago	1
He	1
knows	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
from	1
something	1
she	1
said	1
herself	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
by	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
talking	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
partial	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
it	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
judging	1
harshly	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
almost	1
tempted	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
appearance	1
of	1
duplicity	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
banish	1
every	1
painful	1
thought	1
and	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
your	1
affection	1
and	1
the	1
invariable	1
kindness	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
Let	1
me	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
very	1
soon	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
said	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
never	1
returning	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
again	1
of	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
any	1
certainty	1
We	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
mention	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
extremely	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
such	1
pleasant	1
accounts	1
from	1
our	1
friends	1
at	1
Hunsford	1
Pray	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
with	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Maria	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
comfortable	1
there	1
Yours	1
etc	1
This	1
letter	1
gave	1
Elizabeth	1
some	1
pain	1
but	1
her	1
spirits	1
returned	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
that	1
Jane	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
duped	1
by	1
the	1
sister	1
at	1
least	1
All	1
expectation	1
from	1
the	1
brother	1
was	1
now	1
absolutely	1
over	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
his	1
attentions	1
His	1
character	1
sunk	1
on	1
every	1
review	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
possible	1
advantage	1
to	1
Jane	1
she	1
seriously	1
hoped	1
he	1
might	1
really	1
soon	1
marry	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
s	1
sister	1
as	1
by	1
Wickham	1
s	1
account	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
abundantly	1
regret	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
away	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
reminded	1
Elizabeth	1
of	1
her	1
promise	1
concerning	1
that	1
gentleman	1
and	1
required	1
information	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
such	1
to	1
send	1
as	1
might	1
rather	1
give	1
contentment	1
to	1
her	1
aunt	1
than	1
to	1
herself	1
His	1
apparent	1
partiality	1
had	1
subsided	1
his	1
attentions	1
were	1
over	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
admirer	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
watchful	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
all	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
write	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
material	1
pain	1
Her	1
heart	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
slightly	1
touched	1
and	1
her	1
vanity	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
believing	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
only	1
choice	1
had	1
fortune	1
permitted	1
it	1
The	1
sudden	1
acquisition	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
charm	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
rendering	1
himself	1
agreeable	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
less	1
clear	1
sighted	1
perhaps	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
than	1
in	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
did	1
not	1
quarrel	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
wish	1
of	1
independence	1
Nothing	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
while	1
able	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
struggles	1
to	1
relinquish	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
allow	1
it	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
desirable	1
measure	1
for	1
both	1
and	1
could	1
very	1
sincerely	1
wish	1
him	1
happy	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
and	1
after	1
relating	1
the	1
circumstances	1
she	1
thus	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
convinced	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
had	1
I	1
really	1
experienced	1
that	1
pure	1
and	1
elevating	1
passion	1
I	1
should	1
at	1
present	1
detest	1
his	1
very	1
name	1
and	1
wish	1
him	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
evil	1
But	1
my	1
feelings	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
cordial	1
towards	1
him	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
impartial	1
towards	1
Miss	1
King	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
hate	1
her	1
at	1
all	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
unwilling	1
to	1
think	1
her	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
love	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
My	1
watchfulness	1
has	1
been	1
effectual	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
certainly	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
more	1
interesting	1
object	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
acquaintances	1
were	1
I	1
distractedly	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
regret	1
my	1
comparative	1
insignificance	1
Importance	1
may	1
sometimes	1
be	1
purchased	1
too	1
dearly	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
take	1
his	1
defection	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
heart	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
They	1
are	1
young	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
not	1
yet	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
mortifying	1
conviction	1
that	1
handsome	1
young	1
men	1
must	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
plain	1
Chapter	1
27	1
With	1
no	1
greater	1
events	1
than	1
these	1
in	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family	1
and	1
otherwise	1
diversified	1
by	1
little	1
beyond	1
the	1
walks	1
to	1
Meryton	1
sometimes	1
dirty	1
and	1
sometimes	1
cold	1
did	1
January	1
and	1
February	1
pass	1
away	1
March	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
Hunsford	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
thought	1
very	1
seriously	1
of	1
going	1
thither	1
but	1
Charlotte	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
was	1
depending	1
on	1
the	1
plan	1
and	1
she	1
gradually	1
learned	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
herself	1
with	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
greater	1
certainty	1
Absence	1
had	1
increased	1
her	1
desire	1
of	1
seeing	1
Charlotte	1
again	1
and	1
weakened	1
her	1
disgust	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
There	1
was	1
novelty	1
in	1
the	1
scheme	1
and	1
as	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
such	1
uncompanionable	1
sisters	1
home	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
faultless	1
a	1
little	1
change	1
was	1
not	1
unwelcome	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake	1
The	1
journey	1
would	1
moreover	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
peep	1
at	1
Jane	1
and	1
in	1
short	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
near	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
any	1
delay	1
Everything	1
however	1
went	1
on	1
smoothly	1
and	1
was	1
finally	1
settled	1
according	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
first	1
sketch	1
She	1
was	1
to	1
accompany	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
his	1
second	1
daughter	1
The	1
improvement	1
of	1
spending	1
a	1
night	1
in	1
London	1
was	1
added	1
in	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
plan	1
became	1
perfect	1
as	1
plan	1
could	1
be	1
The	1
only	1
pain	1
was	1
in	1
leaving	1
her	1
father	1
who	1
would	1
certainly	1
miss	1
her	1
and	1
who	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
so	1
little	1
liked	1
her	1
going	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
almost	1
promised	1
to	1
answer	1
her	1
letter	1
The	1
farewell	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
was	1
perfectly	1
friendly	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
even	1
more	1
His	1
present	1
pursuit	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
forget	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
excite	1
and	1
to	1
deserve	1
his	1
attention	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
admired	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
bidding	1
her	1
adieu	1
wishing	1
her	1
every	1
enjoyment	1
reminding	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
expect	1
in	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
and	1
trusting	1
their	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
their	1
opinion	1
of	1
everybody	1
would	1
always	1
coincide	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
solicitude	1
an	1
interest	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
must	1
ever	1
attach	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
sincere	1
regard	1
and	1
she	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
convinced	1
that	1
whether	1
married	1
or	1
single	1
he	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
her	1
model	1
of	1
the	1
amiable	1
and	1
pleasing	1
Her	1
fellow	1
travellers	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
think	1
him	1
less	1
agreeable	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
Maria	1
a	1
good	1
humoured	1
girl	1
but	1
as	1
empty	1
headed	1
as	1
himself	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
worth	1
hearing	1
and	1
were	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
delight	1
as	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
Elizabeth	1
loved	1
absurdities	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
Sir	1
William	1
s	1
too	1
long	1
He	1
could	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
new	1
of	1
the	1
wonders	1
of	1
his	1
presentation	1
and	1
knighthood	1
and	1
his	1
civilities	1
were	1
worn	1
out	1
like	1
his	1
information	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
journey	1
of	1
only	1
twenty	1
four	1
miles	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
it	1
so	1
early	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Gracechurch	1
Street	1
by	1
noon	1
As	1
they	1
drove	1
to	1
Mr	1
Gardiner	1
s	1
door	1
Jane	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
window	1
watching	1
their	1
arrival	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
passage	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
welcome	1
them	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
looking	1
earnestly	1
in	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
healthful	1
and	1
lovely	1
as	1
ever	1
On	1
the	1
stairs	1
were	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
little	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
whose	1
eagerness	1
for	1
their	1
cousin	1
s	1
appearance	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
whose	1
shyness	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
prevented	1
their	1
coming	1
lower	1
All	1
was	1
joy	1
and	1
kindness	1
The	1
day	1
passed	1
most	1
pleasantly	1
away	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
bustle	1
and	1
shopping	1
and	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
theatres	1
Elizabeth	1
then	1
contrived	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
her	1
aunt	1
Their	1
first	1
object	1
was	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
grieved	1
than	1
astonished	1
to	1
hear	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
minute	1
inquiries	1
that	1
though	1
Jane	1
always	1
struggled	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
spirits	1
there	1
were	1
periods	1
of	1
dejection	1
It	1
was	1
reasonable	1
however	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
continue	1
long	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
particulars	1
also	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
visit	1
in	1
Gracechurch	1
Street	1
and	1
repeated	1
conversations	1
occurring	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
between	1
Jane	1
and	1
herself	1
which	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
had	1
from	1
her	1
heart	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
then	1
rallied	1
her	1
niece	1
on	1
Wickham	1
s	1
desertion	1
and	1
complimented	1
her	1
on	1
bearing	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
Elizabeth	1
she	1
added	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
Miss	1
King	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
friend	1
mercenary	1
Pray	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
matrimonial	1
affairs	1
between	1
the	1
mercenary	1
and	1
the	1
prudent	1
motive	1
Where	1
does	1
discretion	1
end	1
and	1
avarice	1
begin	1
Last	1
Christmas	1
you	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
me	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
imprudent	1
and	1
now	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
girl	1
with	1
only	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
mercenary	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
Miss	1
King	1
is	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
harm	1
of	1
her	1
But	1
he	1
paid	1
her	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
attention	1
till	1
her	1
grandfather	1
s	1
death	1
made	1
her	1
mistress	1
of	1
this	1
fortune	1
No	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
allowable	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
gain	1
my	1
affections	1
because	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
what	1
occasion	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
for	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
equally	1
poor	1
But	1
there	1
seems	1
an	1
indelicacy	1
in	1
directing	1
his	1
attentions	1
towards	1
her	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
event	1
A	1
man	1
in	1
distressed	1
circumstances	1
has	1
not	1
time	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
elegant	1
decorums	1
which	1
other	1
people	1
may	1
observe	1
If	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
it	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
Her	1
not	1
objecting	1
does	1
not	1
justify	1
him	1
It	1
only	1
shows	1
her	1
being	1
deficient	1
in	1
something	1
herself	1
sense	1
or	1
feeling	1
Well	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
have	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
choose	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
mercenary	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
foolish	1
No	1
Lizzy	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
choose	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
you	1
know	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
lived	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
Derbyshire	1
Oh	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
Derbyshire	1
and	1
their	1
intimate	1
friends	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
are	1
not	1
much	1
better	1
I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
Thank	1
Heaven	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
morrow	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
one	1
agreeable	1
quality	1
who	1
has	1
neither	1
manner	1
nor	1
sense	1
to	1
recommend	1
him	1
Stupid	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
worth	1
knowing	1
after	1
all	1
Take	1
care	1
Lizzy	1
that	1
speech	1
savours	1
strongly	1
of	1
disappointment	1
Before	1
they	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
play	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
unexpected	1
happiness	1
of	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
in	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
pleasure	1
which	1
they	1
proposed	1
taking	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
determined	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
shall	1
carry	1
us	1
said	1
Mrs	1
Gardiner	1
but	1
perhaps	1
to	1
the	1
Lakes	1
No	1
scheme	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
agreeable	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
her	1
acceptance	1
of	1
the	1
invitation	1
was	1
most	1
ready	1
and	1
grateful	1
Oh	1
my	1
dear	1
dear	1
aunt	1
she	1
rapturously	1
cried	1
what	1
delight	1
what	1
felicity	1
You	1
give	1
me	1
fresh	1
life	1
and	1
vigour	1
Adieu	1
to	1
disappointment	1
and	1
spleen	1
What	1
are	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
rocks	1
and	1
mountains	1
Oh	1
what	1
hours	1
of	1
transport	1
we	1
shall	1
spend	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
do	1
return	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
like	1
other	1
travellers	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
one	1
accurate	1
idea	1
of	1
anything	1
We	1
will	1

Chapter	1
28	1
Every	1
object	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
s	1
journey	1
was	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
sister	1
looking	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
banish	1
all	1
fear	1
for	1
her	1
health	1
and	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
northern	1
tour	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
source	1
of	1
delight	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
lane	1
to	1
Hunsford	1
every	1
eye	1
was	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
and	1
every	1
turning	1
expected	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
in	1
view	1
The	1
palings	1
of	1
Rosings	1
Park	1
was	1
their	1
boundary	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
Elizabeth	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
was	1
discernible	1
The	1
garden	1
sloping	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
house	1
standing	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
green	1
pales	1
and	1
the	1
laurel	1
hedge	1
everything	1
declared	1
they	1
were	1
arriving	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
small	1
gate	1
which	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
short	1
gravel	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
amidst	1
the	1
nods	1
and	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
welcomed	1
her	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
liveliest	1
pleasure	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
satisfied	1
with	1
coming	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
so	1
affectionately	1
received	1
She	1
saw	1
instantly	1
that	1
her	1
cousin	1
s	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
altered	1
by	1
his	1
marriage	1
his	1
formal	1
civility	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
he	1
detained	1
her	1
some	1
minutes	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
satisfy	1
his	1
inquiries	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
They	1
were	1
then	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
delay	1
than	1
his	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
neatness	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
parlour	1
he	1
welcomed	1
them	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
with	1
ostentatious	1
formality	1
to	1
his	1
humble	1
abode	1
and	1
punctually	1
repeated	1
all	1
his	1
wife	1
s	1
offers	1
of	1
refreshment	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
glory	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
in	1
fancying	1
that	1
in	1
displaying	1
the	1
good	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
its	1
aspect	1
and	1
its	1
furniture	1
he	1
addressed	1
himself	1
particularly	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feel	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
in	1
refusing	1
him	1
But	1
though	1
everything	1
seemed	1
neat	1
and	1
comfortable	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
gratify	1
him	1
by	1
any	1
sigh	1
of	1
repentance	1
and	1
rather	1
looked	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
so	1
cheerful	1
an	1
air	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
companion	1
When	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
said	1
anything	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
might	1
reasonably	1
be	1
ashamed	1
which	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
unseldom	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
turned	1
her	1
eye	1
on	1
Charlotte	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
she	1
could	1
discern	1
a	1
faint	1
blush	1
but	1
in	1
general	1
Charlotte	1
wisely	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
After	1
sitting	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
admire	1
every	1
article	1
of	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
the	1
sideboard	1
to	1
the	1
fender	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
London	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
stroll	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
which	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
well	1
laid	1
out	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
cultivation	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
attended	1
himself	1
To	1
work	1
in	1
this	1
garden	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
respectable	1
pleasures	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
admired	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
countenance	1
with	1
which	1
Charlotte	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
healthfulness	1
of	1
the	1
exercise	1
and	1
owned	1
she	1
encouraged	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
Here	1
leading	1
the	1
way	1
through	1
every	1
walk	1
and	1
cross	1
walk	1
and	1
scarcely	1
allowing	1
them	1
an	1
interval	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
praises	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
every	1
view	1
was	1
pointed	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
minuteness	1
which	1
left	1
beauty	1
entirely	1
behind	1
He	1
could	1
number	1
the	1
fields	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
and	1
could	1
tell	1
how	1
many	1
trees	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
clump	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
views	1
which	1
his	1
garden	1
or	1
which	1
the	1
country	1
or	1
kingdom	1
could	1
boast	1
none	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
Rosings	1
afforded	1
by	1
an	1
opening	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
bordered	1
the	1
park	1
nearly	1
opposite	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
handsome	1
modern	1
building	1
well	1
situated	1
on	1
rising	1
ground	1
From	1
his	1
garden	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
would	1
have	1
led	1
them	1
round	1
his	1
two	1
meadows	1
but	1
the	1
ladies	1
not	1
having	1
shoes	1
to	1
encounter	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
frost	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
while	1
Sir	1
William	1
accompanied	1
him	1
Charlotte	1
took	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
friend	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
extremely	1
well	1
pleased	1
probably	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
it	1
without	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
help	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
small	1
but	1
well	1
built	1
and	1
convenient	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
fitted	1
up	1
and	1
arranged	1
with	1
a	1
neatness	1
and	1
consistency	1
of	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
gave	1
Charlotte	1
all	1
the	1
credit	1
When	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
could	1
be	1
forgotten	1
there	1
was	1
really	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
great	1
comfort	1
throughout	1
and	1
by	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
evident	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
it	1
Elizabeth	1
supposed	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
often	1
forgotten	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
learnt	1
that	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
It	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
again	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
dinner	1
when	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
joining	1
in	1
observed	1
Yes	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
on	1
the	1
ensuing	1
Sunday	1
at	1
church	1
and	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
She	1
is	1
all	1
affability	1
and	1
condescension	1
and	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
honoured	1
with	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
her	1
notice	1
when	1
service	1
is	1
over	1
I	1
have	1
scarcely	1
any	1
hesitation	1
in	1
saying	1
she	1
will	1
include	1
you	1
and	1
my	1
sister	1
Maria	1
in	1
every	1
invitation	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
honours	1
us	1
during	1
your	1
stay	1
here	1
Her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
Charlotte	1
is	1
charming	1
We	1
dine	1
at	1
Rosings	1
twice	1
every	1
week	1
and	1
are	1
never	1
allowed	1
to	1
walk	1
home	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
carriage	1
is	1
regularly	1
ordered	1
for	1
us	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
carriages	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
several	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
sensible	1
woman	1
indeed	1
added	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
attentive	1
neighbour	1
Very	1
true	1
my	1
dear	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
woman	1
whom	1
one	1
cannot	1
regard	1
with	1
too	1
much	1
deference	1
The	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
chiefly	1
in	1
talking	1
over	1
Hertfordshire	1
news	1
and	1
telling	1
again	1
what	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
written	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
closed	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
her	1
chamber	1
had	1
to	1
meditate	1
upon	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
degree	1
of	1
contentment	1
to	1
understand	1
her	1
address	1
in	1
guiding	1
and	1
composure	1
in	1
bearing	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
very	1
well	1
She	1
had	1
also	1
to	1
anticipate	1
how	1
her	1
visit	1
would	1
pass	1
the	1
quiet	1
tenor	1
of	1
their	1
usual	1
employments	1
the	1
vexatious	1
interruptions	1
of	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
the	1
gaieties	1
of	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
Rosings	1
A	1
lively	1
imagination	1
soon	1
settled	1
it	1
all	1
About	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
a	1
sudden	1
noise	1
below	1
seemed	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
in	1
confusion	1
and	1
after	1
listening	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
heard	1
somebody	1
running	1
up	1
stairs	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
hurry	1
and	1
calling	1
loudly	1
after	1
her	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
met	1
Maria	1
in	1
the	1
landing	1
place	1
who	1
breathless	1
with	1
agitation	1
cried	1
out	1
Oh	1
my	1
dear	1
Eliza	1
pray	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
Make	1
haste	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
this	1
moment	1
Elizabeth	1
asked	1
questions	1
in	1
vain	1
Maria	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
more	1
and	1
down	1
they	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
which	1
fronted	1
the	1
lane	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
this	1
wonder	1
It	1
was	1
two	1
ladies	1
stopping	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
phaeton	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
gate	1
And	1
is	1
this	1
all	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
expected	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
the	1
pigs	1
were	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
La	1
my	1
dear	1
said	1
Maria	1
quite	1
shocked	1
at	1
the	1
mistake	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
The	1
old	1
lady	1
is	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
who	1
lives	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
Only	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
She	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
creature	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
small	1
She	1
is	1
abominably	1
rude	1
to	1
keep	1
Charlotte	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
wind	1
Why	1
does	1
she	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
Oh	1
Charlotte	1
says	1
she	1
hardly	1
ever	1
does	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
favours	1
when	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
comes	1
in	1
I	1
like	1
her	1
appearance	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
struck	1
with	1
other	1
ideas	1
She	1
looks	1
sickly	1
and	1
cross	1
Yes	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
very	1
well	1
She	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
proper	1
wife	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
were	1
both	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
ladies	1
and	1
Sir	1
William	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
high	1
diversion	1
was	1
stationed	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
in	1
earnest	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
constantly	1
bowing	1
whenever	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
looked	1
that	1
way	1
At	1
length	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
the	1
ladies	1
drove	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
no	1
sooner	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
than	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
congratulate	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
good	1
fortune	1
which	1
Charlotte	1
explained	1
by	1
letting	1
them	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Rosings	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
Chapter	1
29	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
triumph	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
invitation	1
was	1
complete	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
displaying	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
his	1
patroness	1
to	1
his	1
wondering	1
visitors	1
and	1
of	1
letting	1
them	1
see	1
her	1
civility	1
towards	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
wished	1
for	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
so	1
soon	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
condescension	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
admire	1
enough	1
I	1
confess	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
by	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
asking	1
us	1
on	1
Sunday	1
to	1
drink	1
tea	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
Rosings	1
I	1
rather	1
expected	1
from	1
my	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
affability	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
happen	1
But	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
foreseen	1
such	1
an	1
attention	1
as	1
this	1
Who	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
receive	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dine	1
there	1
an	1
invitation	1
moreover	1
including	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
so	1
immediately	1
after	1
your	1
arrival	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
less	1
surprised	1
at	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
replied	1
Sir	1
William	1
from	1
that	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
really	1
are	1
which	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
has	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
acquire	1
About	1
the	1
court	1
such	1
instances	1
of	1
elegant	1
breeding	1
are	1
not	1
uncommon	1
Scarcely	1
anything	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
or	1
next	1
morning	1
but	1
their	1
visit	1
to	1
Rosings	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
carefully	1
instructing	1
them	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
rooms	1
so	1
many	1
servants	1
and	1
so	1
splendid	1
a	1
dinner	1
might	1
not	1
wholly	1
overpower	1
them	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
separating	1
for	1
the	1
toilette	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
Do	1
not	1
make	1
yourself	1
uneasy	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
about	1
your	1
apparel	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
requiring	1
that	1
elegance	1
of	1
dress	1
in	1
us	1
which	1
becomes	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
merely	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
whatever	1
of	1
your	1
clothes	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
anything	1
more	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
worse	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
simply	1
dressed	1
She	1
likes	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
distinction	1
of	1
rank	1
preserved	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
dressing	1
he	1
came	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
their	1
different	1
doors	1
to	1
recommend	1
their	1
being	1
quick	1
as	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
very	1
much	1
objected	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
dinner	1
Such	1
formidable	1
accounts	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
quite	1
frightened	1
Maria	1
Lucas	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
little	1
used	1
to	1
company	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
her	1
introduction	1
at	1
Rosings	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
apprehension	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
his	1
presentation	1
at	1
St	1
James	1
s	1
As	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
fine	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
walk	1
of	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
across	1
the	1
park	1
Every	1
park	1
has	1
its	1
beauty	1
and	1
its	1
prospects	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
raptures	1
as	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
expected	1
the	1
scene	1
to	1
inspire	1
and	1
was	1
but	1
slightly	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
his	1
relation	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
glazing	1
altogether	1
had	1
originally	1
cost	1
Sir	1
Lewis	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
When	1
they	1
ascended	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
Maria	1
s	1
alarm	1
was	1
every	1
moment	1
increasing	1
and	1
even	1
Sir	1
William	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
perfectly	1
calm	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
courage	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
her	1
She	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
that	1
spoke	1
her	1
awful	1
from	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
talents	1
or	1
miraculous	1
virtue	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
stateliness	1
of	1
money	1
or	1
rank	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
witness	1
without	1
trepidation	1
From	1
the	1
entrance	1
hall	1
of	1
which	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
pointed	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
air	1
the	1
fine	1
proportion	1
and	1
the	1
finished	1
ornaments	1
they	1
followed	1
the	1
servants	1
through	1
an	1
ante	1
chamber	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
were	1
sitting	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
with	1
great	1
condescension	1
arose	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
had	1
settled	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
introduction	1
should	1
be	1
hers	1
it	1
was	1
performed	1
in	1
a	1
proper	1
manner	1
without	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
apologies	1
and	1
thanks	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
necessary	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
St	1
James	1
s	1
Sir	1
William	1
was	1
so	1
completely	1
awed	1
by	1
the	1
grandeur	1
surrounding	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
courage	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
bow	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
seat	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
frightened	1
almost	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
senses	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
chair	1
not	1
knowing	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
herself	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
scene	1
and	1
could	1
observe	1
the	1
three	1
ladies	1
before	1
her	1
composedly	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
a	1
tall	1
large	1
woman	1
with	1
strongly	1
marked	1
features	1
which	1
might	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
handsome	1
Her	1
air	1
was	1
not	1
conciliating	1
nor	1
was	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
receiving	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
visitors	1
forget	1
their	1
inferior	1
rank	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
rendered	1
formidable	1
by	1
silence	1
but	1
whatever	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
spoken	1
in	1
so	1
authoritative	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
marked	1
her	1
self	1
importance	1
and	1
brought	1
Mr	1
Wickham	1
immediately	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
mind	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
altogether	1
she	1
believed	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
to	1
be	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
represented	1
When	1
after	1
examining	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
whose	1
countenance	1
and	1
deportment	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
some	1
resemblance	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
daughter	1
she	1
could	1
almost	1
have	1
joined	1
in	1
Maria	1
s	1
astonishment	1
at	1
her	1
being	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
so	1
small	1
There	1
was	1
neither	1
in	1
figure	1
nor	1
face	1
any	1
likeness	1
between	1
the	1
ladies	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
sickly	1
her	1
features	1
though	1
not	1
plain	1
were	1
insignificant	1
and	1
she	1
spoke	1
very	1
little	1
except	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
in	1
whose	1
appearance	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
entirely	1
engaged	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
placing	1
a	1
screen	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
direction	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
After	1
sitting	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
sent	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
view	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
attending	1
them	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
its	1
beauties	1
and	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
kindly	1
informing	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
worth	1
looking	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
handsome	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
plate	1
which	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
had	1
promised	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
likewise	1
foretold	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
by	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
desire	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
life	1
could	1
furnish	1
nothing	1
greater	1
He	1
carved	1
and	1
ate	1
and	1
praised	1
with	1
delighted	1
alacrity	1
and	1
every	1
dish	1
was	1
commended	1
first	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
Sir	1
William	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
enough	1
recovered	1
to	1
echo	1
whatever	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
wondered	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
could	1
bear	1
But	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
seemed	1
gratified	1
by	1
their	1
excessive	1
admiration	1
and	1
gave	1
most	1
gracious	1
smiles	1
especially	1
when	1
any	1
dish	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
proved	1
a	1
novelty	1
to	1
them	1
The	1
party	1
did	1
not	1
supply	1
much	1
conversation	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
speak	1
whenever	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
opening	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
seated	1
between	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
the	1
former	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
dinner	1
time	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
was	1
chiefly	1
employed	1
in	1
watching	1
how	1
little	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
ate	1
pressing	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
some	1
other	1
dish	1
and	1
fearing	1
she	1
was	1
indisposed	1
Maria	1
thought	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
eat	1
and	1
admire	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
to	1
hear	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
talk	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
without	1
any	1
intermission	1
till	1
coffee	1
came	1
in	1
delivering	1
her	1
opinion	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
in	1
so	1
decisive	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
proved	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
judgement	1
controverted	1
She	1
inquired	1
into	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
domestic	1
concerns	1
familiarly	1
and	1
minutely	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
everything	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
regulated	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
family	1
as	1
hers	1
and	1
instructed	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
cows	1
and	1
her	1
poultry	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
beneath	1
this	1
great	1
lady	1
s	1
attention	1
which	1
could	1
furnish	1
her	1
with	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
dictating	1
to	1
others	1
In	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
her	1
discourse	1
with	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
she	1
addressed	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
questions	1
to	1
Maria	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
but	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
whose	1
connections	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
least	1
and	1
who	1
she	1
observed	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
genteel	1
pretty	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
She	1
asked	1
her	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
how	1
many	1
sisters	1
she	1
had	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
older	1
or	1
younger	1
than	1
herself	1
whether	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
handsome	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
what	1
carriage	1
her	1
father	1
kept	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
maiden	1
name	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
impertinence	1
of	1
her	1
questions	1
but	1
answered	1
them	1
very	1
composedly	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
then	1
observed	1
Your	1
father	1
s	1
estate	1
is	1
entailed	1
on	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
I	1
think	1
For	1
your	1
sake	1
turning	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
otherwise	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
entailing	1
estates	1
from	1
the	1
female	1
line	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
thought	1
necessary	1
in	1
Sir	1
Lewis	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
s	1
family	1
Do	1
you	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
A	1
little	1
Oh	1
then	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
Our	1
instrument	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
one	1
probably	1
superior	1
to	1
You	1
shall	1
try	1
it	1
some	1
day	1
Do	1
your	1
sisters	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
does	1
Why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
all	1
learn	1
You	1
ought	1
all	1
to	1
have	1
learned	1
The	1
Miss	1
Webbs	1
all	1
play	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
good	1
an	1
income	1
as	1
yours	1
Do	1
you	1
draw	1
No	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
What	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
Not	1
one	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
strange	1
But	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
Your	1
mother	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
to	1
town	1
every	1
spring	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
masters	1
My	1
mother	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
objection	1
but	1
my	1
father	1
hates	1
London	1
Has	1
your	1
governess	1
left	1
you	1
We	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
governess	1
No	1
governess	1
How	1
was	1
that	1
possible	1
Five	1
daughters	1
brought	1
up	1
at	1
home	1
without	1
a	1
governess	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
Your	1
mother	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
your	1
education	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
smiling	1
as	1
she	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
case	1
Then	1
who	1
taught	1
you	1
who	1
attended	1
to	1
you	1
Without	1
a	1
governess	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
neglected	1
Compared	1
with	1
some	1
families	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
were	1
but	1
such	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
wished	1
to	1
learn	1
never	1
wanted	1
the	1
means	1
We	1
were	1
always	1
encouraged	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
masters	1
that	1
were	1
necessary	1
Those	1
who	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
idle	1
certainly	1
might	1
Aye	1
no	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
governess	1
will	1
prevent	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
your	1
mother	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
advised	1
her	1
most	1
strenuously	1
to	1
engage	1
one	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
education	1
without	1
steady	1
and	1
regular	1
instruction	1
and	1
nobody	1
but	1
a	1
governess	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
It	1
is	1
wonderful	1
how	1
many	1
families	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
supplying	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
young	1
person	1
well	1
placed	1
out	1
Four	1
nieces	1
of	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
are	1
most	1
delightfully	1
situated	1
through	1
my	1
means	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
recommended	1
another	1
young	1
person	1
who	1
was	1
merely	1
accidentally	1
mentioned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
Lady	1
Metcalf	1
s	1
calling	1
yesterday	1
to	1
thank	1
me	1
She	1
finds	1
Miss	1
Pope	1
a	1
treasure	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
said	1
she	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
treasure	1
Are	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
younger	1
sisters	1
out	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
Yes	1
ma	1
am	1
all	1
All	1
What	1
all	1
five	1
out	1
at	1
once	1
Very	1
odd	1
And	1
you	1
only	1
the	1
second	1
The	1
younger	1
ones	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
are	1
married	1
Your	1
younger	1
sisters	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
young	1
Yes	1
my	1
youngest	1
is	1
not	1
sixteen	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
is	1
full	1
young	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
in	1
company	1
But	1
really	1
ma	1
am	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
hard	1
upon	1
younger	1
sisters	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
society	1
and	1
amusement	1
because	1
the	1
elder	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
means	1
or	1
inclination	1
to	1
marry	1
early	1
The	1
last	1
born	1
has	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
youth	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
And	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
back	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
motive	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
promote	1
sisterly	1
affection	1
or	1
delicacy	1
of	1
mind	1
Upon	1
my	1
word	1
said	1
her	1
ladyship	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
opinion	1
very	1
decidedly	1
for	1
so	1
young	1
a	1
person	1
Pray	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
age	1
With	1
three	1
younger	1
sisters	1
grown	1
up	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
smiling	1
your	1
ladyship	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
own	1
it	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
seemed	1
quite	1
astonished	1
at	1
not	1
receiving	1
a	1
direct	1
answer	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
suspected	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
creature	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
dared	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
dignified	1
impertinence	1
You	1
cannot	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
therefore	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
conceal	1
your	1
age	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
and	1
twenty	1
When	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
joined	1
them	1
and	1
tea	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
card	1
tables	1
were	1
placed	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Mr	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
quadrille	1
and	1
as	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
chose	1
to	1
play	1
at	1
cassino	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
assisting	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
party	1
Their	1
table	1
was	1
superlatively	1
stupid	1
Scarcely	1
a	1
syllable	1
was	1
uttered	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
game	1
except	1
when	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
expressed	1
her	1
fears	1
of	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
s	1
being	1
too	1
hot	1
or	1
too	1
cold	1
or	1
having	1
too	1
much	1
or	1
too	1
little	1
light	1
A	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
generally	1
speaking	1
stating	1
the	1
mistakes	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
others	1
or	1
relating	1
some	1
anecdote	1
of	1
herself	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
employed	1
in	1
agreeing	1
to	1
everything	1
her	1
ladyship	1
said	1
thanking	1
her	1
for	1
every	1
fish	1
he	1
won	1
and	1
apologising	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
won	1
too	1
many	1
Sir	1
William	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much	1
He	1
was	1
storing	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
anecdotes	1
and	1
noble	1
names	1
When	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
played	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
chose	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
broken	1
up	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
gratefully	1
accepted	1
and	1
immediately	1
ordered	1
The	1
party	1
then	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
hear	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
determine	1
what	1
weather	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
From	1
these	1
instructions	1
they	1
were	1
summoned	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
speeches	1
of	1
thankfulness	1
on	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
bows	1
on	1
Sir	1
William	1
s	1
they	1
departed	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
called	1
on	1
by	1
her	1
cousin	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Rosings	1
which	1
for	1
Charlotte	1
s	1
sake	1
she	1
made	1
more	1
favourable	1
than	1
it	1
really	1
was	1
But	1
her	1
commendation	1
though	1
costing	1
her	1
some	1
trouble	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
satisfy	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
soon	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
ladyship	1
s	1
praise	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
Chapter	1
30	1
Sir	1
William	1
stayed	1
only	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
Hunsford	1
but	1
his	1
visit	1
was	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
convince	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
being	1
most	1
comfortably	1
settled	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
possessing	1
such	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
neighbour	1
as	1
were	1
not	1
often	1
met	1
with	1
While	1
Sir	1
William	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
devoted	1
his	1
morning	1
to	1
driving	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
gig	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
usual	1
employments	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
thankful	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
cousin	1
by	1
the	1
alteration	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
breakfast	1
and	1
dinner	1
was	1
now	1
passed	1
by	1
him	1
either	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
or	1
in	1
reading	1
and	1
writing	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
book	1
room	1
which	1
fronted	1
the	1
road	1
The	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
ladies	1
sat	1
was	1
backwards	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
wondered	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
should	1
not	1
prefer	1
the	1
dining	1
parlour	1
for	1
common	1
use	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
better	1
sized	1
room	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
more	1
pleasant	1
aspect	1
but	1
she	1
soon	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
an	1
excellent	1
reason	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
for	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
would	1
undoubtedly	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
less	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
apartment	1
had	1
they	1
sat	1
in	1
one	1
equally	1
lively	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
Charlotte	1
credit	1
for	1
the	1
arrangement	1
From	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
they	1
could	1
distinguish	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
and	1
were	1
indebted	1
to	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
carriages	1
went	1
along	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
especially	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
drove	1
by	1
in	1
her	1
phaeton	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
failed	1
coming	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
of	1
though	1
it	1
happened	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
She	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
conversation	1
with	1
Charlotte	1
but	1
was	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
Very	1
few	1
days	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
to	1
Rosings	1
and	1
not	1
many	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
likewise	1
and	1
till	1
Elizabeth	1
recollected	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
other	1
family	1
livings	1
to	1
be	1
disposed	1
of	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
honoured	1
with	1
a	1
call	1
from	1
her	1
ladyship	1
and	1
nothing	1
escaped	1
her	1
observation	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
during	1
these	1
visits	1
She	1
examined	1
into	1
their	1
employments	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
advised	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
differently	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
furniture	1
or	1
detected	1
the	1
housemaid	1
in	1
negligence	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
accepted	1
any	1
refreshment	1
seemed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
finding	1
out	1
that	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
s	1
joints	1
of	1
meat	1
were	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
her	1
family	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
perceived	1
that	1
though	1
this	1
great	1
lady	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
active	1
magistrate	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
parish	1
the	1
minutest	1
concerns	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
carried	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
and	1
whenever	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
were	1
disposed	1
to	1
be	1
quarrelsome	1
discontented	1
or	1
too	1
poor	1
she	1
sallied	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
settle	1
their	1
differences	1
silence	1
their	1
complaints	1
and	1
scold	1
them	1
into	1
harmony	1
and	1
plenty	1
The	1
entertainment	1
of	1
dining	1
at	1
Rosings	1
was	1
repeated	1
about	1
twice	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
there	1
being	1
only	1
one	1
card	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
every	1
such	1
entertainment	1
was	1
the	1
counterpart	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Their	1
other	1
engagements	1
were	1
few	1
as	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
general	1
was	1
beyond	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
s	1
reach	1
This	1
however	1
was	1
no	1
evil	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
she	1
spent	1
her	1
time	1
comfortably	1
enough	1
there	1
were	1
half	1
hours	1
of	1
pleasant	1
conversation	1
with	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
so	1
fine	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
year	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
Her	1
favourite	1
walk	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
frequently	1
went	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
calling	1
on	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
along	1
the	1
open	1
grove	1
which	1
edged	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
park	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
sheltered	1
path	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
value	1
but	1
herself	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
curiosity	1
In	1
this	1
quiet	1
way	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight	1
of	1
her	1
visit	1
soon	1
passed	1
away	1
Easter	1
was	1
approaching	1
and	1
the	1
week	1
preceding	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
at	1
Rosings	1
which	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
circle	1
must	1
be	1
important	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
heard	1
soon	1
after	1
her	1
arrival	1
that	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
was	1
expected	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
and	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
whom	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
prefer	1
his	1
coming	1
would	1
furnish	1
one	1
comparatively	1
new	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
their	1
Rosings	1
parties	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
amused	1
in	1
seeing	1
how	1
hopeless	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
s	1
designs	1
on	1
him	1
were	1
by	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
his	1
cousin	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
destined	1
by	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
who	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
satisfaction	1
spoke	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
admiration	1
and	1
seemed	1
almost	1
angry	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
frequently	1
seen	1
by	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
and	1
herself	1
His	1
arrival	1
was	1
soon	1
known	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
for	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
was	1
walking	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
opening	1
into	1
Hunsford	1
Lane	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
earliest	1
assurance	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
after	1
making	1
his	1
bow	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
Park	1
hurried	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
intelligence	1
On	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
Rosings	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
nephews	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
to	1
require	1
them	1
for	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
uncle	1
Lord	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
surprise	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
party	1
when	1
Mr	1
Collins	1
returned	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
accompanied	1
him	1
Charlotte	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1

crossing	1

and	1
immediately	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
told	1
the	1
girls	1
what	1
an	1
honour	1
they	1
might	1
expect	1
adding	1
I	1
may	1
thank	1
you	1
Eliza	1
for	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
civility	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
come	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
me	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
disclaim	1
all	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
compliment	1
before	1
their	1
approach	1
was	1
announced	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
bell	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
the	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
who	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
about	1
thirty	1
not	1
handsome	1
but	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
address	1
most	1
truly	1
the	1
gentleman	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
paid	1
his	1
compliments	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
reserve	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
and	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
feelings	1
toward	1
her	1
friend	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure	1
Elizabeth	1
merely	1
curtseyed	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
directly	1
with	1
the	1
readiness	1
and	1
ease	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
bred	1
man	1
and	1
talked	1
very	1
pleasantly	1
but	1
his	1
cousin	1
after	1
having	1
addressed	1
a	1
slight	1
observation	1
on	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
to	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
to	1
anybody	1
At	1
length	1
however	1
his	1
civility	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
awakened	1
as	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
after	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
way	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
s	1
pause	1
added	1
My	1
eldest	1
sister	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
these	1
three	1
months	1
Have	1
you	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
there	1
She	1
was	1
perfectly	1
sensible	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
but	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
betray	1
any	1
consciousness	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
and	1
Jane	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
confused	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
meet	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
The	1
subject	1
was	1
pursued	1
no	1
farther	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
went	1
away	1
Chapter	1
31	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
s	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
admired	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
add	1
considerably	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
their	1
engagements	1
at	1
Rosings	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
days	1
however	1
before	1
they	1
received	1
any	1
invitation	1
thither	1
for	1
while	1
there	1
were	1
visitors	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
Easter	1
day	1
almost	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
s	1
arrival	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
honoured	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
attention	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
merely	1
asked	1
on	1
leaving	1
church	1
to	1
come	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
or	1
her	1
daughter	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
had	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
but	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
only	1
at	1
church	1
The	1
invitation	1
was	1
accepted	1
of	1
course	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
proper	1
hour	1
they	1
joined	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
s	1
drawing	1
room	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
received	1
them	1
civilly	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
their	1
company	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
acceptable	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
nobody	1
else	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
almost	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
nephews	1
speaking	1
to	1
them	1
especially	1
to	1
Darcy	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
seemed	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
anything	1
was	1
a	1
welcome	1
relief	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
Rosings	1
and	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
s	1
pretty	1
friend	1
had	1
moreover	1
caught	1
his	1
fancy	1
very	1
much	1
He	1
now	1
seated	1
himself	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
talked	1
so	1
agreeably	1
of	1
Kent	1
and	1
Hertfordshire	1
of	1
travelling	1
and	1
staying	1
at	1
home	1
of	1
new	1
books	1
and	1
music	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
half	1
so	1
well	1
entertained	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
before	1
and	1
they	1
conversed	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
flow	1
as	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
herself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
His	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
soon	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
turned	1
towards	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
shared	1
the	1
feeling	1
was	1
more	1
openly	1
acknowledged	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
call	1
out	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
saying	1
Fitzwilliam	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
of	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
telling	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
Let	1
me	1
hear	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
We	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
music	1
madam	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
reply	1
Of	1
music	1
Then	1
pray	1
speak	1
aloud	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
all	1
subjects	1
my	1
delight	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
my	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
music	1
There	1
are	1
few	1
people	1
in	1
England	1
I	1
suppose	1
who	1
have	1
more	1
true	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
music	1
than	1
myself	1
or	1
a	1
better	1
natural	1
taste	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
learnt	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
proficient	1
And	1
so	1
would	1
Anne	1
if	1
her	1
health	1
had	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
apply	1
I	1
am	1
confident	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
performed	1
delightfully	1
How	1
does	1
Georgiana	1
get	1
on	1
Darcy	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
spoke	1
with	1
affectionate	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
s	1
proficiency	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
said	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
pray	1
tell	1
her	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
expect	1
to	1
excel	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
practice	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
madam	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
need	1
such	1
advice	1
She	1
practises	1
very	1
constantly	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
done	1
too	1
much	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
next	1
write	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
shall	1
charge	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
neglect	1
it	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
I	1
often	1
tell	1
young	1
ladies	1
that	1
no	1
excellence	1
in	1
music	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
acquired	1
without	1
constant	1
practice	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
several	1
times	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
never	1
play	1
really	1
well	1
unless	1
she	1
practises	1
more	1
and	1
though	1
Mrs	1
Collins	1
has	1
no	1
instrument	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
welcome	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Rosings	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
in	1
Mrs	1
Jenkinson	1
s	1
room	1
She	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
nobody	1
s	1
way	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
aunt	1
s	1
ill	1
breeding	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
When	1
coffee	1
was	1
over	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
reminded	1
Elizabeth	1
of	1
having	1
promised	1
to	1
play	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
instrument	1
He	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
near	1
her	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
listened	1
to	1
half	1
a	1
song	1
and	1
then	1
talked	1
as	1
before	1
to	1
her	1
other	1
nephew	1
till	1
the	1
latter	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
making	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
deliberation	1
towards	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
stationed	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
performer	1
s	1
countenance	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
convenient	1
pause	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
arch	1
smile	1
and	1
said	1
You	1
mean	1
to	1
frighten	1
me	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
by	1
coming	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
state	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
though	1
your	1
sister	1
does	1
play	1
so	1
well	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
stubbornness	1
about	1
me	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
others	1
My	1
courage	1
always	1
rises	1
at	1
every	1
attempt	1
to	1
intimidate	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
he	1
replied	1
because	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
really	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
entertain	1
any	1
design	1
of	1
alarming	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
find	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
occasionally	1
professing	1
opinions	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
Elizabeth	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
at	1
this	1
picture	1
of	1
herself	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
Your	1
cousin	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
notion	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
teach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
unlucky	1
in	1
meeting	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
so	1
able	1
to	1
expose	1
my	1
real	1
character	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
pass	1
myself	1
off	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
credit	1
Indeed	1
Mr	1
Darcy	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
ungenerous	1
in	1
you	1
to	1
mention	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
knew	1
to	1
my	1
disadvantage	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
say	1
very	1
impolitic	1
too	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
provoking	1
me	1
to	1
retaliate	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
may	1
come	1
out	1
as	1
will	1
shock	1
your	1
relations	1
to	1
hear	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
you	1
said	1
he	1
smilingly	1
Pray	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
accuse	1
him	1

You	1
will	1
rejoice	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
no	1
disaster	1
has	1
accompanied	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
an	1
enterprise	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
regarded	1
with	1
such	1
evil	1
forebodings	1
I	1
arrived	1
here	1
yesterday	1
and	1
my	1
first	1
task	1
is	1
to	1
assure	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
of	1
my	1
welfare	1
and	1
increasing	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
my	1
undertaking	1
I	1
am	1
already	1
far	1
north	1
of	1
London	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Petersburgh	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
cold	1
northern	1
breeze	1
play	1
upon	1
my	1
cheeks	1
which	1
braces	1
my	1
nerves	1
and	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
delight	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
this	1
feeling	1
This	1
breeze	1
which	1
has	1
travelled	1
from	1
the	1
regions	1
towards	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
advancing	1
gives	1
me	1
a	1
foretaste	1
of	1
those	1
icy	1
climes	1
Inspirited	1
by	1
this	1
wind	1
of	1
promise	1
my	1
daydreams	1
become	1
more	1
fervent	1
and	1
vivid	1
I	1
try	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
pole	1
is	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
frost	1
and	1
desolation	1
it	1
ever	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
imagination	1
as	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
delight	1
There	1
Margaret	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
visible	1
its	1
broad	1
disk	1
just	1
skirting	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
diffusing	1
a	1
perpetual	1
splendour	1
There	1
for	1
with	1
your	1
leave	1
my	1
sister	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
some	1
trust	1
in	1
preceding	1
navigators	1
there	1
snow	1
and	1
frost	1
are	1
banished	1
and	1
sailing	1
over	1
a	1
calm	1
sea	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
wafted	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
surpassing	1
in	1
wonders	1
and	1
in	1
beauty	1
every	1
region	1
hitherto	1
discovered	1
on	1
the	1
habitable	1
globe	1
Its	1
productions	1
and	1
features	1
may	1
be	1
without	1
example	1
as	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
undoubtedly	1
are	1
in	1
those	1
undiscovered	1
solitudes	1
What	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
of	1
eternal	1
light	1
I	1
may	1
there	1
discover	1
the	1
wondrous	1
power	1
which	1
attracts	1
the	1
needle	1
and	1
may	1
regulate	1
a	1
thousand	1
celestial	1
observations	1
that	1
require	1
only	1
this	1
voyage	1
to	1
render	1
their	1
seeming	1
eccentricities	1
consistent	1
for	1
ever	1
I	1
shall	1
satiate	1
my	1
ardent	1
curiosity	1
with	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
never	1
before	1
visited	1
and	1
may	1
tread	1
a	1
land	1
never	1
before	1
imprinted	1
by	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
man	1
These	1
are	1
my	1
enticements	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
sufficient	1
to	1
conquer	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
danger	1
or	1
death	1
and	1
to	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
commence	1
this	1
laborious	1
voyage	1
with	1
the	1
joy	1
a	1
child	1
feels	1
when	1
he	1
embarks	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
with	1
his	1
holiday	1
mates	1
on	1
an	1
expedition	1
of	1
discovery	1
up	1
his	1
native	1
river	1
But	1
supposing	1
all	1
these	1
conjectures	1
to	1
be	1
false	1
you	1
cannot	1
contest	1
the	1
inestimable	1
benefit	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
confer	1
on	1
all	1
mankind	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
generation	1
by	1
discovering	1
a	1
passage	1
near	1
the	1
pole	1
to	1
those	1
countries	1
to	1
reach	1
which	1
at	1
present	1
so	1
many	1
months	1
are	1
requisite	1
or	1
by	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
magnet	1
which	1
if	1
at	1
all	1
possible	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
effected	1
by	1
an	1
undertaking	1
such	1
as	1
mine	1
These	1
reflections	1
have	1
dispelled	1
the	1
agitation	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
began	1
my	1
letter	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
my	1
heart	1
glow	1
with	1
an	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
elevates	1
me	1
to	1
heaven	1
for	1
nothing	1
contributes	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
tranquillise	1
the	1
mind	1
as	1
a	1
steady	1
purpose	1
a	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
soul	1
may	1
fix	1
its	1
intellectual	1
eye	1
This	1
expedition	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
dream	1
of	1
my	1
early	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
with	1
ardour	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
voyages	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
arriving	1
at	1
the	1
North	1
Pacific	1
Ocean	1
through	1
the	1
seas	1
which	1
surround	1
the	1
pole	1
You	1
may	1
remember	1
that	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
voyages	1
made	1
for	1
purposes	1
of	1
discovery	1
composed	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
our	1
good	1
Uncle	1
Thomas	1
library	1
My	1
education	1
was	1
neglected	1
yet	1
I	1
was	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
reading	1
These	1
volumes	1
were	1
my	1
study	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
and	1
my	1
familiarity	1
with	1
them	1
increased	1
that	1
regret	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
felt	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
dying	1
injunction	1
had	1
forbidden	1
my	1
uncle	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
embark	1
in	1
a	1
seafaring	1
life	1
These	1
visions	1
faded	1
when	1
I	1
perused	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
those	1
poets	1
whose	1
effusions	1
entranced	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
heaven	1
I	1
also	1
became	1
a	1
poet	1
and	1
for	1
one	1
year	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
paradise	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
creation	1
I	1
imagined	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
niche	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
where	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Homer	1
and	1
Shakespeare	1
are	1
consecrated	1
You	1
are	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
failure	1
and	1
how	1
heavily	1
I	1
bore	1
the	1
disappointment	1
But	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
inherited	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
my	1
cousin	1
and	1
my	1
thoughts	1
were	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
their	1
earlier	1
bent	1
Six	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
I	1
resolved	1
on	1
my	1
present	1
undertaking	1
I	1
can	1
even	1
now	1
remember	1
the	1
hour	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
dedicated	1
myself	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
enterprise	1
I	1
commenced	1
by	1
inuring	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
hardship	1
I	1
accompanied	1
the	1
whale	1
fishers	1
on	1
several	1
expeditions	1
to	1
the	1
North	1
Sea	1
I	1
voluntarily	1
endured	1
cold	1
famine	1
thirst	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
sleep	1
I	1
often	1
worked	1
harder	1
than	1
the	1
common	1
sailors	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
devoted	1
my	1
nights	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
mathematics	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
medicine	1
and	1
those	1
branches	1
of	1
physical	1
science	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
naval	1
adventurer	1
might	1
derive	1
the	1
greatest	1
practical	1
advantage	1
Twice	1
I	1
actually	1
hired	1
myself	1
as	1
an	1
under	1
mate	1
in	1
a	1
Greenland	1
whaler	1
and	1
acquitted	1
myself	1
to	1
admiration	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
proud	1
when	1
my	1
captain	1
offered	1
me	1
the	1
second	1
dignity	1
in	1
the	1
vessel	1
and	1
entreated	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
earnestness	1
so	1
valuable	1
did	1
he	1
consider	1
my	1
services	1
And	1
now	1
dear	1
Margaret	1
do	1
I	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
accomplish	1
some	1
great	1
purpose	1
My	1
life	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
ease	1
and	1
luxury	1
but	1
I	1
preferred	1
glory	1
to	1
every	1
enticement	1
that	1
wealth	1
placed	1
in	1
my	1
path	1
Oh	1
that	1
some	1
encouraging	1
voice	1
would	1
answer	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
My	1
courage	1
and	1
my	1
resolution	1
is	1
firm	1
but	1
my	1
hopes	1
fluctuate	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
are	1
often	1
depressed	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
proceed	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
difficult	1
voyage	1
the	1
emergencies	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
demand	1
all	1
my	1
fortitude	1
I	1
am	1
required	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
others	1
but	1
sometimes	1
to	1
sustain	1
my	1
own	1
when	1
theirs	1
are	1
failing	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
favourable	1
period	1
for	1
travelling	1
in	1
Russia	1
They	1
fly	1
quickly	1
over	1
the	1
snow	1
in	1
their	1
sledges	1
the	1
motion	1
is	1
pleasant	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
far	1
more	1
agreeable	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
stagecoach	1
The	1
cold	1
is	1
not	1
excessive	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
wrapped	1
in	1
furs	1
a	1
dress	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
adopted	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
walking	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
remaining	1
seated	1
motionless	1
for	1
hours	1
when	1
no	1
exercise	1
prevents	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
actually	1
freezing	1
in	1
your	1
veins	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
ambition	1
to	1
lose	1
my	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
post	1
road	1
between	1
St	1
Petersburgh	1
and	1
Archangel	1
I	1
shall	1
depart	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
town	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight	1
or	1
three	1
weeks	1
and	1
my	1
intention	1
is	1
to	1
hire	1
a	1
ship	1
there	1
which	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
paying	1
the	1
insurance	1
for	1
the	1
owner	1
and	1
to	1
engage	1
as	1
many	1
sailors	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
necessary	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
fishing	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
sail	1
until	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
June	1
and	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
return	1
Ah	1
dear	1
sister	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
answer	1
this	1
question	1
If	1
I	1
succeed	1
many	1
many	1
months	1
perhaps	1
years	1
will	1
pass	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
meet	1
If	1
I	1
fail	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
again	1
soon	1
or	1
never	1
Farewell	1
my	1
dear	1
excellent	1
Margaret	1
Heaven	1
shower	1
down	1
blessings	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
save	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
testify	1
my	1
gratitude	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
love	1
and	1
kindness	1

28th	1
March	1
17	1
How	1
slowly	1
the	1
time	1
passes	1
here	1
encompassed	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
frost	1
and	1
snow	1
Yet	1
a	1
second	1
step	1
is	1
taken	1
towards	1
my	1
enterprise	1
I	1
have	1
hired	1
a	1
vessel	1
and	1
am	1
occupied	1
in	1
collecting	1
my	1
sailors	1
those	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
engaged	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
men	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
depend	1
and	1
are	1
certainly	1
possessed	1
of	1
dauntless	1
courage	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
want	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
satisfy	1
and	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
feel	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
severe	1
evil	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
friend	1
Margaret	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
glowing	1
with	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
success	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
participate	1
my	1
joy	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
assailed	1
by	1
disappointment	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
sustain	1
me	1
in	1
dejection	1
I	1
shall	1
commit	1
my	1
thoughts	1
to	1
paper	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
medium	1
for	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
feeling	1
I	1
desire	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
sympathise	1
with	1
me	1
whose	1
eyes	1
would	1
reply	1
to	1
mine	1
You	1
may	1
deem	1
me	1
romantic	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
but	1
I	1
bitterly	1
feel	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
near	1
me	1
gentle	1
yet	1
courageous	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
cultivated	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
capacious	1
mind	1
whose	1
tastes	1
are	1
like	1
my	1
own	1
to	1
approve	1
or	1
amend	1
my	1
plans	1
How	1
would	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
repair	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
your	1
poor	1
brother	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
ardent	1
in	1
execution	1
and	1
too	1
impatient	1
of	1
difficulties	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
evil	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
self	1
educated	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
fourteen	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
ran	1
wild	1
on	1
a	1
common	1
and	1
read	1
nothing	1
but	1
our	1
Uncle	1
Thomas	1
books	1
of	1
voyages	1
At	1
that	1
age	1
I	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
celebrated	1
poets	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
country	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
derive	1
its	1
most	1
important	1
benefits	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
I	1
perceived	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
with	1
more	1
languages	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
twenty	1
eight	1
and	1
am	1
in	1
reality	1
more	1
illiterate	1
than	1
many	1
schoolboys	1
of	1
fifteen	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
more	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
daydreams	1
are	1
more	1
extended	1
and	1
magnificent	1
but	1
they	1
want	1
as	1
the	1
painters	1
call	1
it	1
keeping	1
	1
and	1
I	1
greatly	1
need	1
a	1
friend	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
sense	1
enough	1
not	1
to	1
despise	1
me	1
as	1
romantic	1
and	1
affection	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
endeavour	1
to	1
regulate	1
my	1
mind	1
Well	1
these	1
are	1
useless	1
complaints	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
find	1
no	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
wide	1
ocean	1
nor	1
even	1
here	1
in	1
Archangel	1
among	1
merchants	1
and	1
seamen	1
Yet	1
some	1
feelings	1
unallied	1
to	1
the	1
dross	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
beat	1
even	1
in	1
these	1
rugged	1
bosoms	1
My	1
lieutenant	1
for	1
instance	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wonderful	1
courage	1
and	1
enterprise	1
he	1
is	1
madly	1
desirous	1
of	1
glory	1
or	1
rather	1
to	1
word	1
my	1
phrase	1
more	1
characteristically	1
of	1
advancement	1
in	1
his	1
profession	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
Englishman	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
national	1
and	1
professional	1
prejudices	1
unsoftened	1
by	1
cultivation	1
retains	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
noblest	1
endowments	1
of	1
humanity	1
I	1
first	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
whale	1
vessel	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unemployed	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
I	1
easily	1
engaged	1
him	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
my	1
enterprise	1
The	1
master	1
is	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
an	1
excellent	1
disposition	1
and	1
is	1
remarkable	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
his	1
gentleness	1
and	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
his	1
discipline	1
This	1
circumstance	1
added	1
to	1
his	1
well	1
known	1
integrity	1
and	1
dauntless	1
courage	1
made	1
me	1
very	1
desirous	1
to	1
engage	1
him	1
A	1
youth	1
passed	1
in	1
solitude	1
my	1
best	1
years	1
spent	1
under	1
your	1
gentle	1
and	1
feminine	1
fosterage	1
has	1
so	1
refined	1
the	1
groundwork	1
of	1
my	1
character	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
overcome	1
an	1
intense	1
distaste	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
brutality	1
exercised	1
on	1
board	1
ship	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
mariner	1
equally	1
noted	1
for	1
his	1
kindliness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
obedience	1
paid	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
crew	1
I	1
felt	1
myself	1
peculiarly	1
fortunate	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
services	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
first	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
romantic	1
manner	1
from	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
owes	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
This	1
briefly	1
is	1
his	1
story	1
Some	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
loved	1
a	1
young	1
Russian	1
lady	1
of	1
moderate	1
fortune	1
and	1
having	1
amassed	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum	1
in	1
prize	1
money	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
girl	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
match	1
He	1
saw	1
his	1
mistress	1
once	1
before	1
the	1
destined	1
ceremony	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
bathed	1
in	1
tears	1
and	1
throwing	1
herself	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
confessing	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
another	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
never	1
consent	1
to	1
the	1
union	1
My	1
generous	1
friend	1
reassured	1
the	1
suppliant	1
and	1
on	1
being	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
instantly	1
abandoned	1
his	1
pursuit	1
He	1
had	1
already	1
bought	1
a	1
farm	1
with	1
his	1
money	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
designed	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
but	1
he	1
bestowed	1
the	1
whole	1
on	1
his	1
rival	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
prize	1
money	1
to	1
purchase	1
stock	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
solicited	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
s	1
father	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
her	1
marriage	1
with	1
her	1
lover	1
But	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
decidedly	1
refused	1
thinking	1
himself	1
bound	1
in	1
honour	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
father	1
inexorable	1
quitted	1
his	1
country	1
nor	1
returned	1
until	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
his	1
former	1
mistress	1
was	1
married	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
inclinations	1
What	1
a	1
noble	1
fellow	1
you	1
will	1
exclaim	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
wholly	1
uneducated	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
silent	1
as	1
a	1
Turk	1
and	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
ignorant	1
carelessness	1
attends	1
him	1
which	1
while	1
it	1
renders	1
his	1
conduct	1
the	1
more	1
astonishing	1
detracts	1
from	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
sympathy	1
which	1
otherwise	1
he	1
would	1
command	1
Yet	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
because	1
I	1
complain	1
a	1
little	1
or	1
because	1
I	1
can	1
conceive	1
a	1
consolation	1
for	1
my	1
toils	1
which	1
I	1
may	1
never	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
wavering	1
in	1
my	1
resolutions	1
Those	1
are	1
as	1
fixed	1
as	1
fate	1
and	1
my	1
voyage	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
delayed	1
until	1
the	1
weather	1
shall	1
permit	1
my	1
embarkation	1
The	1
winter	1
has	1
been	1
dreadfully	1
severe	1
but	1
the	1
spring	1
promises	1
well	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
remarkably	1
early	1
season	1
so	1
that	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may	1
sail	1
sooner	1
than	1
I	1
expected	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
nothing	1
rashly	1
you	1
know	1
me	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
my	1
prudence	1
and	1
considerateness	1
whenever	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
others	1
is	1
committed	1
to	1
my	1
care	1
I	1
cannot	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
sensations	1
on	1
the	1
near	1
prospect	1
of	1
my	1
undertaking	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
trembling	1
sensation	1
half	1
pleasurable	1
and	1
half	1
fearful	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
preparing	1
to	1
depart	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
unexplored	1
regions	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
mist	1
and	1
snow	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
kill	1
no	1
albatross	1
therefore	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
for	1
my	1
safety	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
worn	1
and	1
woeful	1
as	1
the	1
Ancient	1
Mariner	1
You	1
will	1
smile	1
at	1
my	1
allusion	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
disclose	1
a	1
secret	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
attributed	1
my	1
attachment	1
to	1
my	1
passionate	1
enthusiasm	1
for	1
the	1
dangerous	1
mysteries	1
of	1
ocean	1
to	1
that	1
production	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
imaginative	1
of	1
modern	1
poets	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
I	1
am	1
practically	1
industrious	1
painstaking	1
a	1
workman	1
to	1
execute	1
with	1
perseverance	1
and	1
labour	1
but	1
besides	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
marvellous	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
marvellous	1
intertwined	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
projects	1
which	1
hurries	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
pathways	1
of	1
men	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
sea	1
and	1
unvisited	1
regions	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
explore	1
But	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
dearer	1
considerations	1
Shall	1
I	1
meet	1
you	1
again	1
after	1
having	1
traversed	1
immense	1
seas	1
and	1
returned	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
southern	1
cape	1
of	1
Africa	1
or	1
America	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
success	1
yet	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
Continue	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
every	1
opportunity	1
I	1
may	1
receive	1
your	1
letters	1
on	1
some	1
occasions	1
when	1
I	1
need	1
them	1
most	1
to	1
support	1
my	1
spirits	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
very	1
tenderly	1
Remember	1
me	1
with	1
affection	1
should	1
you	1
never	1
hear	1
from	1
me	1

My	1
dear	1
Sister	1
I	1
write	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
safe	1
and	1
well	1
advanced	1
on	1
my	1
voyage	1
This	1
letter	1
will	1
reach	1
England	1
by	1
a	1
merchantman	1
now	1
on	1
its	1
homeward	1
voyage	1
from	1
Archangel	1
more	1
fortunate	1
than	1
I	1
who	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
native	1
land	1
perhaps	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
I	1
am	1
however	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
my	1
men	1
are	1
bold	1
and	1
apparently	1
firm	1
of	1
purpose	1
nor	1
do	1
the	1
floating	1
sheets	1
of	1
ice	1
that	1
continually	1
pass	1
us	1
indicating	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
region	1
towards	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
advancing	1
appear	1
to	1
dismay	1
them	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
reached	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
latitude	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
summer	1
and	1
although	1
not	1
so	1
warm	1
as	1
in	1
England	1
the	1
southern	1
gales	1
which	1
blow	1
us	1
speedily	1
towards	1
those	1
shores	1
which	1
I	1
so	1
ardently	1
desire	1
to	1
attain	1
breathe	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
renovating	1
warmth	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
No	1
incidents	1
have	1
hitherto	1
befallen	1
us	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
One	1
or	1
two	1
stiff	1
gales	1
and	1
the	1
springing	1
of	1
a	1
leak	1
are	1
accidents	1
which	1
experienced	1
navigators	1
scarcely	1
remember	1
to	1
record	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
content	1
if	1
nothing	1
worse	1
happen	1
to	1
us	1
during	1
our	1
voyage	1
Adieu	1
my	1
dear	1
Margaret	1
Be	1
assured	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
yours	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rashly	1
encounter	1
danger	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
cool	1
persevering	1
and	1
prudent	1
But	1
success	1
shall	1
crown	1
my	1
endeavours	1
Wherefore	1
not	1
Thus	1
far	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
tracing	1
a	1
secure	1
way	1
over	1
the	1
pathless	1
seas	1
the	1
very	1
stars	1
themselves	1
being	1
witnesses	1
and	1
testimonies	1
of	1
my	1
triumph	1
Why	1
not	1
still	1
proceed	1
over	1
the	1
untamed	1
yet	1
obedient	1
element	1
What	1
can	1
stop	1
the	1
determined	1
heart	1
and	1
resolved	1
will	1
of	1
man	1
My	1
swelling	1
heart	1
involuntarily	1
pours	1
itself	1
out	1
thus	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
finish	1
Heaven	1
bless	1
my	1
beloved	1

To	1

August	1

17	1
So	1
strange	1
an	1
accident	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
recording	1
it	1
although	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
probable	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
before	1
these	1
papers	1
can	1
come	1
into	1
your	1
possession	1
Last	1
Monday	1
July	1
31st	1
we	1
were	1
nearly	1
surrounded	1
by	1
ice	1
which	1
closed	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
scarcely	1
leaving	1
her	1
the	1
sea	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
floated	1
Our	1
situation	1
was	1
somewhat	1
dangerous	1
especially	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
compassed	1
round	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
thick	1
fog	1
We	1
accordingly	1
lay	1
to	1
hoping	1
that	1
some	1
change	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
and	1
weather	1
About	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
mist	1
cleared	1
away	1
and	1
we	1
beheld	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
vast	1
and	1
irregular	1
plains	1
of	1
ice	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
end	1
Some	1
of	1
my	1
comrades	1
groaned	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
watchful	1
with	1
anxious	1
thoughts	1
when	1
a	1
strange	1
sight	1
suddenly	1
attracted	1
our	1
attention	1
and	1
diverted	1
our	1
solicitude	1
from	1
our	1
own	1
situation	1
We	1
perceived	1
a	1
low	1
carriage	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
dogs	1
pass	1
on	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
a	1
being	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
apparently	1
of	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
sledge	1
and	1
guided	1
the	1
dogs	1
We	1
watched	1
the	1
rapid	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
traveller	1
with	1
our	1
telescopes	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
lost	1
among	1
the	1
distant	1
inequalities	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
This	1
appearance	1
excited	1
our	1
unqualified	1
wonder	1
We	1
were	1
as	1
we	1
believed	1
many	1
hundred	1
miles	1
from	1
any	1
land	1
but	1
this	1
apparition	1
seemed	1
to	1
denote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
reality	1
so	1
distant	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
supposed	1
Shut	1
in	1
however	1
by	1
ice	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
track	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
observed	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
About	1
two	1
hours	1
after	1
this	1
occurrence	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
ground	1
sea	1
and	1
before	1
night	1
the	1
ice	1
broke	1
and	1
freed	1
our	1
ship	1
We	1
however	1
lay	1
to	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
fearing	1
to	1
encounter	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
those	1
large	1
loose	1
masses	1
which	1
float	1
about	1
after	1
the	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
I	1
profited	1
of	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
however	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
light	1
I	1
went	1
upon	1
deck	1
and	1
found	1
all	1
the	1
sailors	1
busy	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
vessel	1
apparently	1
talking	1
to	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
a	1
sledge	1
like	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
before	1
which	1
had	1
drifted	1
towards	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
fragment	1
of	1
ice	1
Only	1
one	1
dog	1
remained	1
alive	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
within	1
it	1
whom	1
the	1
sailors	1
were	1
persuading	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
vessel	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
traveller	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
savage	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
some	1
undiscovered	1
island	1
but	1
a	1
European	1
When	1
I	1
appeared	1
on	1
deck	1
the	1
master	1
said	1
Here	1
is	1
our	1
captain	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
you	1
to	1
perish	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
On	1
perceiving	1
me	1
the	1
stranger	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
English	1
although	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
accent	1
Before	1
I	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
your	1
vessel	1
said	1
he	1
will	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
kindness	1
to	1
inform	1
me	1
whither	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
You	1
may	1
conceive	1
my	1
astonishment	1
on	1
hearing	1
such	1
a	1
question	1
addressed	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
destruction	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
supposed	1
that	1
my	1
vessel	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
resource	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
exchanged	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
wealth	1
the	1
earth	1
can	1
afford	1
I	1
replied	1
however	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
discovery	1
towards	1
the	1
northern	1
pole	1
Upon	1
hearing	1
this	1
he	1
appeared	1
satisfied	1
and	1
consented	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
Good	1
God	1
Margaret	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
thus	1
capitulated	1
for	1
his	1
safety	1
your	1
surprise	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
boundless	1
His	1
limbs	1
were	1
nearly	1
frozen	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
dreadfully	1
emaciated	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
suffering	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
so	1
wretched	1
a	1
condition	1
We	1
attempted	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
he	1
fainted	1
We	1
accordingly	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
restored	1
him	1
to	1
animation	1
by	1
rubbing	1
him	1
with	1
brandy	1
and	1
forcing	1
him	1
to	1
swallow	1
a	1
small	1
quantity	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
showed	1
signs	1
of	1
life	1
we	1
wrapped	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
blankets	1
and	1
placed	1
him	1
near	1
the	1
chimney	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
stove	1
By	1
slow	1
degrees	1
he	1
recovered	1
and	1
ate	1
a	1
little	1
soup	1
which	1
restored	1
him	1
wonderfully	1
Two	1
days	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
I	1
often	1
feared	1
that	1
his	1
sufferings	1
had	1
deprived	1
him	1
of	1
understanding	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
recovered	1
I	1
removed	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
cabin	1
and	1
attended	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
my	1
duty	1
would	1
permit	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
interesting	1
creature	1
his	1
eyes	1
have	1
generally	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
wildness	1
and	1
even	1
madness	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
moments	1
when	1
if	1
anyone	1
performs	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
kindness	1
towards	1
him	1
or	1
does	1
him	1
any	1
the	1
most	1
trifling	1
service	1
his	1
whole	1
countenance	1
is	1
lighted	1
up	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
a	1
beam	1
of	1
benevolence	1
and	1
sweetness	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
equalled	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
generally	1
melancholy	1
and	1
despairing	1
and	1
sometimes	1
he	1
gnashes	1
his	1
teeth	1
as	1
if	1
impatient	1
of	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
woes	1
that	1
oppresses	1
him	1
When	1
my	1
guest	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
recovered	1
I	1
had	1
great	1
trouble	1
to	1
keep	1
off	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
questions	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
tormented	1
by	1
their	1
idle	1
curiosity	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
mind	1
whose	1
restoration	1
evidently	1
depended	1
upon	1
entire	1
repose	1
Once	1
however	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
asked	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
so	1
far	1
upon	1
the	1
ice	1
in	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
vehicle	1
His	1
countenance	1
instantly	1
assumed	1
an	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
gloom	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
To	1
seek	1
one	1
who	1
fled	1
from	1
me	1
And	1
did	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
you	1
pursued	1
travel	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fashion	1
Yes	1
Then	1
I	1
fancy	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
we	1
picked	1
you	1
up	1
we	1
saw	1
some	1
dogs	1
drawing	1
a	1
sledge	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
across	1
the	1
ice	1
This	1
aroused	1
the	1
stranger	1
s	1
attention	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
questions	1
concerning	1
the	1
route	1
which	1
the	1
daemon	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
had	1
pursued	1
Soon	1
after	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
have	1
doubtless	1
excited	1
your	1
curiosity	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
these	1
good	1
people	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
considerate	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
Certainly	1
it	1
would	1
indeed	1
be	1
very	1
impertinent	1
and	1
inhuman	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
with	1
any	1
inquisitiveness	1
of	1
mine	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
rescued	1
me	1
from	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
perilous	1
situation	1
you	1
have	1
benevolently	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
Soon	1
after	1
this	1
he	1
inquired	1
if	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
had	1
destroyed	1
the	1
other	1
sledge	1
I	1
replied	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
with	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
certainty	1
for	1
the	1
ice	1
had	1
not	1
broken	1
until	1
near	1
midnight	1
and	1
the	1
traveller	1
might	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
before	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
judge	1
From	1
this	1
time	1
a	1
new	1
spirit	1
of	1
life	1
animated	1
the	1
decaying	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
He	1
manifested	1
the	1
greatest	1
eagerness	1
to	1
be	1
upon	1
deck	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
sledge	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
appeared	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
far	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
sustain	1
the	1
rawness	1
of	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
that	1
someone	1
should	1
watch	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
instant	1
notice	1
if	1
any	1
new	1
object	1
should	1
appear	1
in	1
sight	1
Such	1
is	1
my	1
journal	1
of	1
what	1
relates	1
to	1
this	1
strange	1
occurrence	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
The	1
stranger	1
has	1
gradually	1
improved	1
in	1
health	1
but	1
is	1
very	1
silent	1
and	1
appears	1
uneasy	1
when	1
anyone	1
except	1
myself	1
enters	1
his	1
cabin	1
Yet	1
his	1
manners	1
are	1
so	1
conciliating	1
and	1
gentle	1
that	1
the	1
sailors	1
are	1
all	1
interested	1
in	1
him	1
although	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
communication	1
with	1
him	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
constant	1
and	1
deep	1
grief	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
sympathy	1
and	1
compassion	1
He	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
noble	1
creature	1
in	1
his	1
better	1
days	1
being	1
even	1
now	1
in	1
wreck	1
so	1
attractive	1
and	1
amiable	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
letters	1
my	1
dear	1
Margaret	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
no	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
wide	1
ocean	1
yet	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
before	1
his	1
spirit	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
by	1
misery	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
possessed	1
as	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
shall	1
continue	1
my	1
journal	1
concerning	1
the	1
stranger	1
at	1
intervals	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
fresh	1
incidents	1
to	1
record	1
August	1
13th	1
17	1
My	1
affection	1
for	1
my	1
guest	1
increases	1
every	1
day	1
He	1
excites	1
at	1
once	1
my	1
admiration	1
and	1
my	1
pity	1
to	1
an	1
astonishing	1
degree	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
see	1
so	1
noble	1
a	1
creature	1
destroyed	1
by	1
misery	1
without	1
feeling	1
the	1
most	1
poignant	1
grief	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
gentle	1
yet	1
so	1
wise	1
his	1
mind	1
is	1
so	1
cultivated	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1
although	1
his	1
words	1
are	1
culled	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
art	1
yet	1
they	1
flow	1
with	1
rapidity	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
eloquence	1
He	1
is	1
now	1
much	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
illness	1
and	1
is	1
continually	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
apparently	1
watching	1
for	1
the	1
sledge	1
that	1
preceded	1
his	1
own	1
Yet	1
although	1
unhappy	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
utterly	1
occupied	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
misery	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
interests	1
himself	1
deeply	1
in	1
the	1
projects	1
of	1
others	1
He	1
has	1
frequently	1
conversed	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
mine	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
communicated	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
disguise	1
He	1
entered	1
attentively	1
into	1
all	1
my	1
arguments	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
my	1
eventual	1
success	1
and	1
into	1
every	1
minute	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
I	1
was	1
easily	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
sympathy	1
which	1
he	1
evinced	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
the	1
burning	1
ardour	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
fervour	1
that	1
warmed	1
me	1
how	1
gladly	1
I	1
would	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
fortune	1
my	1
existence	1
my	1
every	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
my	1
enterprise	1
One	1
man	1
s	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
price	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
acquirement	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
which	1
I	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
dominion	1
I	1
should	1
acquire	1
and	1
transmit	1
over	1
the	1
elemental	1
foes	1
of	1
our	1
race	1
As	1
I	1
spoke	1
a	1
dark	1
gloom	1
spread	1
over	1
my	1
listener	1
s	1
countenance	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
suppress	1
his	1
emotion	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
my	1
voice	1
quivered	1
and	1
failed	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
beheld	1
tears	1
trickle	1
fast	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
fingers	1
a	1
groan	1
burst	1
from	1
his	1
heaving	1
breast	1
I	1
paused	1
at	1
length	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
broken	1
accents	1
Unhappy	1
man	1
Do	1
you	1
share	1
my	1
madness	1
Have	1
you	1
drunk	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
intoxicating	1
draught	1
Hear	1
me	1
let	1
me	1
reveal	1
my	1
tale	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
dash	1
the	1
cup	1
from	1
your	1
lips	1
Such	1
words	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
strongly	1
excited	1
my	1
curiosity	1
but	1
the	1
paroxysm	1
of	1
grief	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
the	1
stranger	1
overcame	1
his	1
weakened	1
powers	1
and	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
repose	1
and	1
tranquil	1
conversation	1
were	1
necessary	1
to	1
restore	1
his	1
composure	1
Having	1
conquered	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
his	1
feelings	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
despise	1
himself	1
for	1
being	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
passion	1
and	1
quelling	1
the	1
dark	1
tyranny	1
of	1
despair	1
he	1
led	1
me	1
again	1
to	1
converse	1
concerning	1
myself	1
personally	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
earlier	1
years	1
The	1
tale	1
was	1
quickly	1
told	1
but	1
it	1
awakened	1
various	1
trains	1
of	1
reflection	1
I	1
spoke	1
of	1
my	1
desire	1
of	1
finding	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
my	1
thirst	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
intimate	1
sympathy	1
with	1
a	1
fellow	1
mind	1
than	1
had	1
ever	1
fallen	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
and	1
expressed	1
my	1
conviction	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
boast	1
of	1
little	1
happiness	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
enjoy	1
this	1
blessing	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
replied	1
the	1
stranger	1
we	1
are	1
unfashioned	1
creatures	1
but	1
half	1
made	1
up	1
if	1
one	1
wiser	1
better	1
dearer	1
than	1
ourselves	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
do	1
not	1
lend	1
his	1
aid	1
to	1
perfectionate	1
our	1
weak	1
and	1
faulty	1
natures	1
I	1
once	1
had	1
a	1
friend	1
the	1
most	1
noble	1
of	1
human	1
creatures	1
and	1
am	1
entitled	1
therefore	1
to	1
judge	1
respecting	1
friendship	1
You	1
have	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
despair	1
But	1
I	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
everything	1
and	1
cannot	1
begin	1
life	1
anew	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
his	1
countenance	1
became	1
expressive	1
of	1
a	1
calm	1
settled	1
grief	1
that	1
touched	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
presently	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
cabin	1
Even	1
broken	1
in	1
spirit	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
feel	1
more	1
deeply	1
than	1
he	1
does	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
nature	1
The	1
starry	1
sky	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
every	1
sight	1
afforded	1
by	1
these	1
wonderful	1
regions	1
seem	1
still	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
elevating	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
earth	1
Such	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
double	1
existence	1
he	1
may	1
suffer	1
misery	1
and	1
be	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
disappointments	1
yet	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
retired	1
into	1
himself	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
celestial	1
spirit	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
halo	1
around	1
him	1
within	1
whose	1
circle	1
no	1
grief	1
or	1
folly	1
ventures	1
Will	1
you	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
I	1
express	1
concerning	1
this	1
divine	1
wanderer	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
if	1
you	1
saw	1
him	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
tutored	1
and	1
refined	1
by	1
books	1
and	1
retirement	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
therefore	1
somewhat	1
fastidious	1
but	1
this	1
only	1
renders	1
you	1
the	1
more	1
fit	1
to	1
appreciate	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
merits	1
of	1
this	1
wonderful	1
man	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
quality	1
it	1
is	1
which	1
he	1
possesses	1
that	1
elevates	1
him	1
so	1
immeasurably	1
above	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
I	1
ever	1
knew	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
intuitive	1
discernment	1
a	1
quick	1
but	1
never	1
failing	1
power	1
of	1
judgment	1
a	1
penetration	1
into	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
things	1
unequalled	1
for	1
clearness	1
and	1
precision	1
add	1
to	1
this	1
a	1
facility	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
whose	1
varied	1
intonations	1
are	1
soul	1
subduing	1
music	1
August	1
19th	1
17	1
Yesterday	1
the	1
stranger	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
You	1
may	1
easily	1
perceive	1
Captain	1
Walton	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
great	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
misfortunes	1
I	1
had	1
determined	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
these	1
evils	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
won	1
me	1
to	1
alter	1
my	1
determination	1
You	1
seek	1
for	1
knowledge	1
and	1
wisdom	1
as	1
I	1
once	1
did	1
and	1
I	1
ardently	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
your	1
wishes	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
serpent	1
to	1
sting	1
you	1
as	1
mine	1
has	1
been	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
my	1
disasters	1
will	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
you	1
yet	1
when	1
I	1
reflect	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
pursuing	1
the	1
same	1
course	1
exposing	1
yourself	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
dangers	1
which	1
have	1
rendered	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
deduce	1
an	1
apt	1
moral	1
from	1
my	1
tale	1
one	1
that	1
may	1
direct	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
succeed	1
in	1
your	1
undertaking	1
and	1
console	1
you	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
failure	1
Prepare	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
occurrences	1
which	1
are	1
usually	1
deemed	1
marvellous	1
Were	1
we	1
among	1
the	1
tamer	1
scenes	1
of	1
nature	1
I	1
might	1
fear	1
to	1
encounter	1
your	1
unbelief	1
perhaps	1
your	1
ridicule	1
but	1
many	1
things	1
will	1
appear	1
possible	1
in	1
these	1
wild	1
and	1
mysterious	1
regions	1
which	1
would	1
provoke	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
those	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
ever	1
varied	1
powers	1
of	1
nature	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
tale	1
conveys	1
in	1
its	1
series	1
internal	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
composed	1
You	1
may	1
easily	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
the	1
offered	1
communication	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
renew	1
his	1
grief	1
by	1
a	1
recital	1
of	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
greatest	1
eagerness	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
promised	1
narrative	1
partly	1
from	1
curiosity	1
and	1
partly	1
from	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
ameliorate	1
his	1
fate	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
I	1
expressed	1
these	1
feelings	1
in	1
my	1
answer	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
he	1
replied	1
for	1
your	1
sympathy	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
my	1
fate	1
is	1
nearly	1
fulfilled	1
I	1
wait	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
event	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
repose	1
in	1
peace	1
I	1
understand	1
your	1
feeling	1
continued	1
he	1
perceiving	1
that	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
interrupt	1
him	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
my	1
friend	1
if	1
thus	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
name	1
you	1
nothing	1
can	1
alter	1
my	1
destiny	1
listen	1
to	1
my	1
history	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
perceive	1
how	1
irrevocably	1
it	1
is	1
determined	1
He	1
then	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
commence	1
his	1
narrative	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
leisure	1
This	1
promise	1
drew	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
warmest	1

I	1
have	1
resolved	1
every	1
night	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
imperatively	1
occupied	1
by	1
my	1
duties	1
to	1
record	1
as	1
nearly	1
as	1
possible	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
related	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
engaged	1
I	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
make	1
notes	1
This	1
manuscript	1
will	1
doubtless	1
afford	1
you	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
who	1
know	1
him	1
and	1
who	1
hear	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
lips	1
with	1
what	1
interest	1
and	1
sympathy	1
shall	1
I	1
read	1
it	1
in	1
some	1
future	1
day	1
Even	1
now	1
as	1
I	1
commence	1
my	1
task	1
his	1
full	1
toned	1
voice	1
swells	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
his	1
lustrous	1
eyes	1
dwell	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
melancholy	1
sweetness	1
I	1
see	1
his	1
thin	1
hand	1
raised	1
in	1
animation	1
while	1
the	1
lineaments	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
are	1
irradiated	1
by	1
the	1
soul	1
within	1
Strange	1
and	1
harrowing	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
story	1
frightful	1
the	1
storm	1
which	1
embraced	1
the	1

on	1
its	1

Chapter	1
1	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
birth	1
a	1
Genevese	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
of	1
that	1
republic	1
My	1
ancestors	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
counsellors	1
and	1
syndics	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
filled	1
several	1
public	1
situations	1
with	1
honour	1
and	1
reputation	1
He	1
was	1
respected	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
integrity	1
and	1
indefatigable	1
attention	1
to	1
public	1
business	1
He	1
passed	1
his	1
younger	1
days	1
perpetually	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
circumstances	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
marrying	1
early	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
As	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
illustrate	1
his	1
character	1
I	1
cannot	1
refrain	1
from	1
relating	1
them	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends	1
was	1
a	1
merchant	1
who	1
from	1
a	1
flourishing	1
state	1
fell	1
through	1
numerous	1
mischances	1
into	1
poverty	1
This	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Beaufort	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
unbending	1
disposition	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
poverty	1
and	1
oblivion	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
country	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
distinguished	1
for	1
his	1
rank	1
and	1
magnificence	1
Having	1
paid	1
his	1
debts	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
honourable	1
manner	1
he	1
retreated	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Lucerne	1
where	1
he	1
lived	1
unknown	1
and	1
in	1
wretchedness	1
My	1
father	1
loved	1
Beaufort	1
with	1
the	1
truest	1
friendship	1
and	1
was	1
deeply	1
grieved	1
by	1
his	1
retreat	1
in	1
these	1
unfortunate	1
circumstances	1
He	1
bitterly	1
deplored	1
the	1
false	1
pride	1
which	1
led	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
a	1
conduct	1
so	1
little	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
affection	1
that	1
united	1
them	1
He	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
seek	1
him	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
world	1
again	1
through	1
his	1
credit	1
and	1
assistance	1
Beaufort	1
had	1
taken	1
effectual	1
measures	1
to	1
conceal	1
himself	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
months	1
before	1
my	1
father	1
discovered	1
his	1
abode	1
Overjoyed	1
at	1
this	1
discovery	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
was	1
situated	1
in	1
a	1
mean	1
street	1
near	1
the	1
Reuss	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
misery	1
and	1
despair	1
alone	1
welcomed	1
him	1
Beaufort	1
had	1
saved	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
from	1
the	1
wreck	1
of	1
his	1
fortunes	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
sustenance	1
for	1
some	1
months	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
procure	1
some	1
respectable	1
employment	1
in	1
a	1
merchant	1
s	1
house	1
The	1
interval	1
was	1
consequently	1
spent	1
in	1
inaction	1
his	1
grief	1
only	1
became	1
more	1
deep	1
and	1
rankling	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
leisure	1
for	1
reflection	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
it	1
took	1
so	1
fast	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
months	1
he	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
sickness	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
exertion	1
His	1
daughter	1
attended	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
tenderness	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
despair	1
that	1
their	1
little	1
fund	1
was	1
rapidly	1
decreasing	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
prospect	1
of	1
support	1
But	1
Caroline	1
Beaufort	1
possessed	1
a	1
mind	1
of	1
an	1
uncommon	1
mould	1
and	1
her	1
courage	1
rose	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
adversity	1
She	1
procured	1
plain	1
work	1
she	1
plaited	1
straw	1
and	1
by	1
various	1
means	1
contrived	1
to	1
earn	1
a	1
pittance	1
scarcely	1
sufficient	1
to	1
support	1
life	1
Several	1
months	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
Her	1
father	1
grew	1
worse	1
her	1
time	1
was	1
more	1
entirely	1
occupied	1
in	1
attending	1
him	1
her	1
means	1
of	1
subsistence	1
decreased	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month	1
her	1
father	1
died	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
leaving	1
her	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
beggar	1
This	1
last	1
blow	1
overcame	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
knelt	1
by	1
Beaufort	1
s	1
coffin	1
weeping	1
bitterly	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber	1
He	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
protecting	1
spirit	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
who	1
committed	1
herself	1
to	1
his	1
care	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
interment	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
he	1
conducted	1
her	1
to	1
Geneva	1
and	1
placed	1
her	1
under	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
a	1
relation	1
Two	1
years	1
after	1
this	1
event	1
Caroline	1
became	1
his	1
wife	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
ages	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
but	1
this	1
circumstance	1
seemed	1
to	1
unite	1
them	1
only	1
closer	1
in	1
bonds	1
of	1
devoted	1
affection	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
justice	1
in	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
upright	1
mind	1
which	1
rendered	1
it	1
necessary	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
approve	1
highly	1
to	1
love	1
strongly	1
Perhaps	1
during	1
former	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
late	1
discovered	1
unworthiness	1
of	1
one	1
beloved	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
greater	1
value	1
on	1
tried	1
worth	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
gratitude	1
and	1
worship	1
in	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
my	1
mother	1
differing	1
wholly	1
from	1
the	1
doting	1
fondness	1
of	1
age	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
inspired	1
by	1
reverence	1
for	1
her	1
virtues	1
and	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
recompensing	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sorrows	1
she	1
had	1
endured	1
but	1
which	1
gave	1
inexpressible	1
grace	1
to	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
her	1
Everything	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
her	1
wishes	1
and	1
her	1
convenience	1
He	1
strove	1
to	1
shelter	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
fair	1
exotic	1
is	1
sheltered	1
by	1
the	1
gardener	1
from	1
every	1
rougher	1
wind	1
and	1
to	1
surround	1
her	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
tend	1
to	1
excite	1
pleasurable	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
soft	1
and	1
benevolent	1
mind	1
Her	1
health	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
her	1
hitherto	1
constant	1
spirit	1
had	1
been	1
shaken	1
by	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
During	1
the	1
two	1
years	1
that	1
had	1
elapsed	1
previous	1
to	1
their	1
marriage	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
gradually	1
relinquished	1
all	1
his	1
public	1
functions	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
their	1
union	1
they	1
sought	1
the	1
pleasant	1
climate	1
of	1
Italy	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
scene	1
and	1
interest	1
attendant	1
on	1
a	1
tour	1
through	1
that	1
land	1
of	1
wonders	1
as	1
a	1
restorative	1
for	1
her	1
weakened	1
frame	1
From	1
Italy	1
they	1
visited	1
Germany	1
and	1
France	1
I	1
their	1
eldest	1
child	1
was	1
born	1
at	1
Naples	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
infant	1
accompanied	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
rambles	1
I	1
remained	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
their	1
only	1
child	1
Much	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
attached	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
draw	1
inexhaustible	1
stores	1
of	1
affection	1
from	1
a	1
very	1
mine	1
of	1
love	1
to	1
bestow	1
them	1
upon	1
me	1
My	1
mother	1
s	1
tender	1
caresses	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
smile	1
of	1
benevolent	1
pleasure	1
while	1
regarding	1
me	1
are	1
my	1
first	1
recollections	1
I	1
was	1
their	1
plaything	1
and	1
their	1
idol	1
and	1
something	1
better	1
their	1
child	1
the	1
innocent	1
and	1
helpless	1
creature	1
bestowed	1
on	1
them	1
by	1
Heaven	1
whom	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
to	1
good	1
and	1
whose	1
future	1
lot	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
to	1
direct	1
to	1
happiness	1
or	1
misery	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
fulfilled	1
their	1
duties	1
towards	1
me	1
With	1
this	1
deep	1
consciousness	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
owed	1
towards	1
the	1
being	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
life	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
active	1
spirit	1
of	1
tenderness	1
that	1
animated	1
both	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
imagined	1
that	1
while	1
during	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
my	1
infant	1
life	1
I	1
received	1
a	1
lesson	1
of	1
patience	1
of	1
charity	1
and	1
of	1
self	1
control	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
guided	1
by	1
a	1
silken	1
cord	1
that	1
all	1
seemed	1
but	1
one	1
train	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
to	1
me	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
their	1
only	1
care	1
My	1
mother	1
had	1
much	1
desired	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
but	1
I	1
continued	1
their	1
single	1
offspring	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
while	1
making	1
an	1
excursion	1
beyond	1
the	1
frontiers	1
of	1
Italy	1
they	1
passed	1
a	1
week	1
on	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
Lake	1
of	1
Como	1
Their	1
benevolent	1
disposition	1
often	1
made	1
them	1
enter	1
the	1
cottages	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
This	1
to	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
duty	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
necessity	1
a	1
passion	1
remembering	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
relieved	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
act	1
in	1
her	1
turn	1
the	1
guardian	1
angel	1
to	1
the	1
afflicted	1
During	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
walks	1
a	1
poor	1
cot	1
in	1
the	1
foldings	1
of	1
a	1
vale	1
attracted	1
their	1
notice	1
as	1
being	1
singularly	1
disconsolate	1
while	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
half	1
clothed	1
children	1
gathered	1
about	1
it	1
spoke	1
of	1
penury	1
in	1
its	1
worst	1
shape	1
One	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
gone	1
by	1
himself	1
to	1
Milan	1
my	1
mother	1
accompanied	1
by	1
me	1
visited	1
this	1
abode	1
She	1
found	1
a	1
peasant	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hard	1
working	1
bent	1
down	1
by	1
care	1
and	1
labour	1
distributing	1
a	1
scanty	1
meal	1
to	1
five	1
hungry	1
babes	1
Among	1
these	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
attracted	1
my	1
mother	1
far	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
She	1
appeared	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
stock	1
The	1
four	1
others	1
were	1
dark	1
eyed	1
hardy	1
little	1
vagrants	1
this	1
child	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
very	1
fair	1
Her	1
hair	1
was	1
the	1
brightest	1
living	1
gold	1
and	1
despite	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
her	1
clothing	1
seemed	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
distinction	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
Her	1
brow	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
ample	1
her	1
blue	1
eyes	1
cloudless	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
moulding	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
so	1
expressive	1
of	1
sensibility	1
and	1
sweetness	1
that	1
none	1
could	1
behold	1
her	1
without	1
looking	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
distinct	1
species	1
a	1
being	1
heaven	1
sent	1
and	1
bearing	1
a	1
celestial	1
stamp	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
features	1
The	1
peasant	1
woman	1
perceiving	1
that	1
my	1
mother	1
fixed	1
eyes	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
admiration	1
on	1
this	1
lovely	1
girl	1
eagerly	1
communicated	1
her	1
history	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
child	1
but	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
Milanese	1
nobleman	1
Her	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
German	1
and	1
had	1
died	1
on	1
giving	1
her	1
birth	1
The	1
infant	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
with	1
these	1
good	1
people	1
to	1
nurse	1
they	1
were	1
better	1
off	1
then	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
married	1
and	1
their	1
eldest	1
child	1
was	1
but	1
just	1
born	1
The	1
father	1
of	1
their	1
charge	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
Italians	1
nursed	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
antique	1
glory	1
of	1
Italy	1
one	1
among	1
the	1
schiavi	1
ognor	1
frementi	1
	1
who	1
exerted	1
himself	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
He	1
became	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
its	1
weakness	1
Whether	1
he	1
had	1
died	1
or	1
still	1
lingered	1
in	1
the	1
dungeons	1
of	1
Austria	1
was	1
not	1
known	1
His	1
property	1
was	1
confiscated	1
his	1
child	1
became	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
beggar	1
She	1
continued	1
with	1
her	1
foster	1
parents	1
and	1
bloomed	1
in	1
their	1
rude	1
abode	1
fairer	1
than	1
a	1
garden	1
rose	1
among	1
dark	1
leaved	1
brambles	1
When	1
my	1
father	1
returned	1
from	1
Milan	1
he	1
found	1
playing	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
our	1
villa	1
a	1
child	1
fairer	1
than	1
pictured	1
cherub	1
a	1
creature	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
shed	1
radiance	1
from	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
whose	1
form	1
and	1
motions	1
were	1
lighter	1
than	1
the	1
chamois	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
The	1
apparition	1
was	1
soon	1
explained	1
With	1
his	1
permission	1
my	1
mother	1
prevailed	1
on	1
her	1
rustic	1
guardians	1
to	1
yield	1
their	1
charge	1
to	1
her	1
They	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
sweet	1
orphan	1
Her	1
presence	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
blessing	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unfair	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
in	1
poverty	1
and	1
want	1
when	1
Providence	1
afforded	1
her	1
such	1
powerful	1
protection	1
They	1
consulted	1
their	1
village	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
Lavenza	1
became	1
the	1
inmate	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
house	1
my	1
more	1
than	1
sister	1
the	1
beautiful	1
and	1
adored	1
companion	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
occupations	1
and	1
my	1
pleasures	1
Everyone	1
loved	1
Elizabeth	1
The	1
passionate	1
and	1
almost	1
reverential	1
attachment	1
with	1
which	1
all	1
regarded	1
her	1
became	1
while	1
I	1
shared	1
it	1
my	1
pride	1
and	1
my	1
delight	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
previous	1
to	1
her	1
being	1
brought	1
to	1
my	1
home	1
my	1
mother	1
had	1
said	1
playfully	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
present	1
for	1
my	1
Victor	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
it	1
And	1
when	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
she	1
presented	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
her	1
promised	1
gift	1
I	1
with	1
childish	1
seriousness	1
interpreted	1
her	1
words	1
literally	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
Elizabeth	1
as	1
mine	1
mine	1
to	1
protect	1
love	1
and	1
cherish	1
All	1
praises	1
bestowed	1
on	1
her	1
I	1
received	1
as	1
made	1
to	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
We	1
called	1
each	1
other	1
familiarly	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
cousin	1
No	1
word	1
no	1
expression	1
could	1
body	1
forth	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
relation	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
stood	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
more	1
than	1
sister	1
since	1
till	1
death	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
mine	1
only	1
Chapter	1
2	1
We	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
together	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
year	1
difference	1
in	1
our	1
ages	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
strangers	1
to	1
any	1
species	1
of	1
disunion	1
or	1
dispute	1
Harmony	1
was	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
our	1
companionship	1
and	1
the	1
diversity	1
and	1
contrast	1
that	1
subsisted	1
in	1
our	1
characters	1
drew	1
us	1
nearer	1
together	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
calmer	1
and	1
more	1
concentrated	1
disposition	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
ardour	1
I	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
intense	1
application	1
and	1
was	1
more	1
deeply	1
smitten	1
with	1
the	1
thirst	1
for	1
knowledge	1
She	1
busied	1
herself	1
with	1
following	1
the	1
aerial	1
creations	1
of	1
the	1
poets	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
majestic	1
and	1
wondrous	1
scenes	1
which	1
surrounded	1
our	1
Swiss	1
home	1
the	1
sublime	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
the	1
changes	1
of	1
the	1
seasons	1
tempest	1
and	1
calm	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
winter	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
turbulence	1
of	1
our	1
Alpine	1
summers	1
she	1
found	1
ample	1
scope	1
for	1
admiration	1
and	1
delight	1
While	1
my	1
companion	1
contemplated	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
and	1
satisfied	1
spirit	1
the	1
magnificent	1
appearances	1
of	1
things	1
I	1
delighted	1
in	1
investigating	1
their	1
causes	1
The	1
world	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
secret	1
which	1
I	1
desired	1
to	1
divine	1
Curiosity	1
earnest	1
research	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
hidden	1
laws	1
of	1
nature	1
gladness	1
akin	1
to	1
rapture	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
unfolded	1
to	1
me	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
earliest	1
sensations	1
I	1
can	1
remember	1
On	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
son	1
my	1
junior	1
by	1
seven	1
years	1
my	1
parents	1
gave	1
up	1
entirely	1
their	1
wandering	1
life	1
and	1
fixed	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
native	1
country	1
We	1
possessed	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
Geneva	1
and	1
a	1
campagne	1
on	1
Belrive	1
the	1
eastern	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
We	1
resided	1
principally	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
were	1
passed	1
in	1
considerable	1
seclusion	1
It	1
was	1
my	1
temper	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
crowd	1
and	1
to	1
attach	1
myself	1
fervently	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
I	1
was	1
indifferent	1
therefore	1
to	1
my	1
school	1
fellows	1
in	1
general	1
but	1
I	1
united	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
the	1
closest	1
friendship	1
to	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
Henry	1
Clerval	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
merchant	1
of	1
Geneva	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
singular	1
talent	1
and	1
fancy	1
He	1
loved	1
enterprise	1
hardship	1
and	1
even	1
danger	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake	1
He	1
was	1
deeply	1
read	1
in	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
romance	1
He	1
composed	1
heroic	1
songs	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
many	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
enchantment	1
and	1
knightly	1
adventure	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
act	1
plays	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
masquerades	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
characters	1
were	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
Roncesvalles	1
of	1
the	1
Round	1
Table	1
of	1
King	1
Arthur	1
and	1
the	1
chivalrous	1
train	1
who	1
shed	1
their	1
blood	1
to	1
redeem	1
the	1
holy	1
sepulchre	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
infidels	1
No	1
human	1
being	1
could	1
have	1
passed	1
a	1
happier	1
childhood	1
than	1
myself	1
My	1
parents	1
were	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
spirit	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
indulgence	1
We	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
tyrants	1
to	1
rule	1
our	1
lot	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
caprice	1
but	1
the	1
agents	1
and	1
creators	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
many	1
delights	1
which	1
we	1
enjoyed	1
When	1
I	1
mingled	1
with	1
other	1
families	1
I	1
distinctly	1
discerned	1
how	1
peculiarly	1
fortunate	1
my	1
lot	1
was	1
and	1
gratitude	1
assisted	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
filial	1
love	1
My	1
temper	1
was	1
sometimes	1
violent	1
and	1
my	1
passions	1
vehement	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
law	1
in	1
my	1
temperature	1
they	1
were	1
turned	1
not	1
towards	1
childish	1
pursuits	1
but	1
to	1
an	1
eager	1
desire	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
learn	1
all	1
things	1
indiscriminately	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
languages	1
nor	1
the	1
code	1
of	1
governments	1
nor	1
the	1
politics	1
of	1
various	1
states	1
possessed	1
attractions	1
for	1
me	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
that	1
I	1
desired	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
outward	1
substance	1
of	1
things	1
or	1
the	1
inner	1
spirit	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
mysterious	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
occupied	1
me	1
still	1
my	1
inquiries	1
were	1
directed	1
to	1
the	1
metaphysical	1
or	1
in	1
its	1
highest	1
sense	1
the	1
physical	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
Meanwhile	1
Clerval	1
occupied	1
himself	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
moral	1
relations	1
of	1
things	1
The	1
busy	1
stage	1
of	1
life	1
the	1
virtues	1
of	1
heroes	1
and	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
men	1
were	1
his	1
theme	1
and	1
his	1
hope	1
and	1
his	1
dream	1
was	1
to	1
become	1
one	1
among	1
those	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
recorded	1
in	1
story	1
as	1
the	1
gallant	1
and	1
adventurous	1
benefactors	1
of	1
our	1
species	1
The	1
saintly	1
soul	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
shone	1
like	1
a	1
shrine	1
dedicated	1
lamp	1
in	1
our	1
peaceful	1
home	1
Her	1
sympathy	1
was	1
ours	1
her	1
smile	1
her	1
soft	1
voice	1
the	1
sweet	1
glance	1
of	1
her	1
celestial	1
eyes	1
were	1
ever	1
there	1
to	1
bless	1
and	1
animate	1
us	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
living	1
spirit	1
of	1
love	1
to	1
soften	1
and	1
attract	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
become	1
sullen	1
in	1
my	1
study	1
rough	1
through	1
the	1
ardour	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
subdue	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
semblance	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
gentleness	1
And	1
Clerval	1
could	1
aught	1
ill	1
entrench	1
on	1
the	1
noble	1
spirit	1
of	1
Clerval	1
Yet	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
perfectly	1
humane	1
so	1
thoughtful	1
in	1
his	1
generosity	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
tenderness	1
amidst	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
adventurous	1
exploit	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
unfolded	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
real	1
loveliness	1
of	1
beneficence	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
doing	1
good	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
aim	1
of	1
his	1
soaring	1
ambition	1
I	1
feel	1
exquisite	1
pleasure	1
in	1
dwelling	1
on	1
the	1
recollections	1
of	1
childhood	1
before	1
misfortune	1
had	1
tainted	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
changed	1
its	1
bright	1
visions	1
of	1
extensive	1
usefulness	1
into	1
gloomy	1
and	1
narrow	1
reflections	1
upon	1
self	1
Besides	1
in	1
drawing	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
my	1
early	1
days	1
I	1
also	1
record	1
those	1
events	1
which	1
led	1
by	1
insensible	1
steps	1
to	1
my	1
after	1
tale	1
of	1
misery	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
account	1
to	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
that	1
passion	1
which	1
afterwards	1
ruled	1
my	1
destiny	1
I	1
find	1
it	1
arise	1
like	1
a	1
mountain	1
river	1
from	1
ignoble	1
and	1
almost	1
forgotten	1
sources	1
but	1
swelling	1
as	1
it	1
proceeded	1
it	1
became	1
the	1
torrent	1
which	1
in	1
its	1
course	1
has	1
swept	1
away	1
all	1
my	1
hopes	1
and	1
joys	1
Natural	1
philosophy	1
is	1
the	1
genius	1
that	1
has	1
regulated	1
my	1
fate	1
I	1
desire	1
therefore	1
in	1
this	1
narration	1
to	1
state	1
those	1
facts	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
my	1
predilection	1
for	1
that	1
science	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
thirteen	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
we	1
all	1
went	1
on	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
pleasure	1
to	1
the	1
baths	1
near	1
Thonon	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
obliged	1
us	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
day	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
In	1
this	1
house	1
I	1
chanced	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Cornelius	1
Agrippa	1
I	1
opened	1
it	1
with	1
apathy	1
the	1
theory	1
which	1
he	1
attempts	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
and	1
the	1
wonderful	1
facts	1
which	1
he	1
relates	1
soon	1
changed	1
this	1
feeling	1
into	1
enthusiasm	1
A	1
new	1
light	1
seemed	1
to	1
dawn	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
bounding	1
with	1
joy	1
I	1
communicated	1
my	1
discovery	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
My	1
father	1
looked	1
carelessly	1
at	1
the	1
title	1
page	1
of	1
my	1
book	1
and	1
said	1
Ah	1
Cornelius	1
Agrippa	1
My	1
dear	1
Victor	1
do	1
not	1
waste	1
your	1
time	1
upon	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
sad	1
trash	1
If	1
instead	1
of	1
this	1
remark	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
pains	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
Agrippa	1
had	1
been	1
entirely	1
exploded	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
modern	1
system	1
of	1
science	1
had	1
been	1
introduced	1
which	1
possessed	1
much	1
greater	1
powers	1
than	1
the	1
ancient	1
because	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
were	1
chimerical	1
while	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
were	1
real	1
and	1
practical	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
I	1
should	1
certainly	1
have	1
thrown	1
Agrippa	1
aside	1
and	1
have	1
contented	1
my	1
imagination	1
warmed	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
returning	1
with	1
greater	1
ardour	1
to	1
my	1
former	1
studies	1
It	1
is	1
even	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
my	1
ideas	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
fatal	1
impulse	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
my	1
ruin	1
But	1
the	1
cursory	1
glance	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
taken	1
of	1
my	1
volume	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
assured	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
its	1
contents	1
and	1
I	1
continued	1
to	1
read	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
avidity	1
When	1
I	1
returned	1
home	1
my	1
first	1
care	1
was	1
to	1
procure	1
the	1
whole	1
works	1
of	1
this	1
author	1
and	1
afterwards	1
of	1
Paracelsus	1
and	1
Albertus	1
Magnus	1
I	1
read	1
and	1
studied	1
the	1
wild	1
fancies	1
of	1
these	1
writers	1
with	1
delight	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
treasures	1
known	1
to	1
few	1
besides	1
myself	1
I	1
have	1
described	1
myself	1
as	1
always	1
having	1
been	1
imbued	1
with	1
a	1
fervent	1
longing	1
to	1
penetrate	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
nature	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
intense	1
labour	1
and	1
wonderful	1
discoveries	1
of	1
modern	1
philosophers	1
I	1
always	1
came	1
from	1
my	1
studies	1
discontented	1
and	1
unsatisfied	1
Sir	1
Isaac	1
Newton	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
avowed	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
picking	1
up	1
shells	1
beside	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
unexplored	1
ocean	1
of	1
truth	1
Those	1
of	1
his	1
successors	1
in	1
each	1
branch	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
acquainted	1
appeared	1
even	1
to	1
my	1
boy	1
s	1
apprehensions	1
as	1
tyros	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pursuit	1
The	1
untaught	1
peasant	1
beheld	1
the	1
elements	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
their	1
practical	1
uses	1
The	1
most	1
learned	1
philosopher	1
knew	1
little	1
more	1
He	1
had	1
partially	1
unveiled	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Nature	1
but	1
her	1
immortal	1
lineaments	1
were	1
still	1
a	1
wonder	1
and	1
a	1
mystery	1
He	1
might	1
dissect	1
anatomise	1
and	1
give	1
names	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
final	1
cause	1
causes	1
in	1
their	1
secondary	1
and	1
tertiary	1
grades	1
were	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
had	1
gazed	1
upon	1
the	1
fortifications	1
and	1
impediments	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
keep	1
human	1
beings	1
from	1
entering	1
the	1
citadel	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
rashly	1
and	1
ignorantly	1
I	1
had	1
repined	1
But	1
here	1
were	1
books	1
and	1
here	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
penetrated	1
deeper	1
and	1
knew	1
more	1
I	1
took	1
their	1
word	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
averred	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
their	1
disciple	1
It	1
may	1
appear	1
strange	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
arise	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
but	1
while	1
I	1
followed	1
the	1
routine	1
of	1
education	1
in	1
the	1
schools	1
of	1
Geneva	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
self	1
taught	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
my	1
favourite	1
studies	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
not	1
scientific	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	1
a	1
child	1
s	1
blindness	1
added	1
to	1
a	1
student	1
s	1
thirst	1
for	1
knowledge	1
Under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
my	1
new	1
preceptors	1
I	1
entered	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
diligence	1
into	1
the	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
philosopher	1
s	1
stone	1
and	1
the	1
elixir	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
soon	1
obtained	1
my	1
undivided	1
attention	1
Wealth	1
was	1
an	1
inferior	1
object	1
but	1
what	1
glory	1
would	1
attend	1
the	1
discovery	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
banish	1
disease	1
from	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
and	1
render	1
man	1
invulnerable	1
to	1
any	1
but	1
a	1
violent	1
death	1
Nor	1
were	1
these	1
my	1
only	1
visions	1
The	1
raising	1
of	1
ghosts	1
or	1
devils	1
was	1
a	1
promise	1
liberally	1
accorded	1
by	1
my	1
favourite	1
authors	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
most	1
eagerly	1
sought	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
incantations	1
were	1
always	1
unsuccessful	1
I	1
attributed	1
the	1
failure	1
rather	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
inexperience	1
and	1
mistake	1
than	1
to	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
skill	1
or	1
fidelity	1
in	1
my	1
instructors	1
And	1
thus	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
exploded	1
systems	1
mingling	1
like	1
an	1
unadept	1
a	1
thousand	1
contradictory	1
theories	1
and	1
floundering	1
desperately	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
slough	1
of	1
multifarious	1
knowledge	1
guided	1
by	1
an	1
ardent	1
imagination	1
and	1
childish	1
reasoning	1
till	1
an	1
accident	1
again	1
changed	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
my	1
ideas	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
fifteen	1
years	1
old	1
we	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
our	1
house	1
near	1
Belrive	1
when	1
we	1
witnessed	1
a	1
most	1
violent	1
and	1
terrible	1
thunderstorm	1
It	1
advanced	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Jura	1
and	1
the	1
thunder	1
burst	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
frightful	1
loudness	1
from	1
various	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
I	1
remained	1
while	1
the	1
storm	1
lasted	1
watching	1
its	1
progress	1
with	1
curiosity	1
and	1
delight	1
As	1
I	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
fire	1
issue	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
and	1
beautiful	1
oak	1
which	1
stood	1
about	1
twenty	1
yards	1
from	1
our	1
house	1
and	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
dazzling	1
light	1
vanished	1
the	1
oak	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
nothing	1
remained	1
but	1
a	1
blasted	1
stump	1
When	1
we	1
visited	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
tree	1
shattered	1
in	1
a	1
singular	1
manner	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
splintered	1
by	1
the	1
shock	1
but	1
entirely	1
reduced	1
to	1
thin	1
ribbons	1
of	1
wood	1
I	1
never	1
beheld	1
anything	1
so	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
Before	1
this	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
more	1
obvious	1
laws	1
of	1
electricity	1
On	1
this	1
occasion	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
research	1
in	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
was	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
excited	1
by	1
this	1
catastrophe	1
he	1
entered	1
on	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
a	1
theory	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
electricity	1
and	1
galvanism	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
new	1
and	1
astonishing	1
to	1
me	1
All	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
threw	1
greatly	1
into	1
the	1
shade	1
Cornelius	1
Agrippa	1
Albertus	1
Magnus	1
and	1
Paracelsus	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
my	1
imagination	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
fatality	1
the	1
overthrow	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
disinclined	1
me	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
accustomed	1
studies	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
would	1
or	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
known	1
All	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
engaged	1
my	1
attention	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
despicable	1
By	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
caprices	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
perhaps	1
most	1
subject	1
to	1
in	1
early	1
youth	1
I	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
up	1
my	1
former	1
occupations	1
set	1
down	1
natural	1
history	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
progeny	1
as	1
a	1
deformed	1
and	1
abortive	1
creation	1
and	1
entertained	1
the	1
greatest	1
disdain	1
for	1
a	1
would	1
be	1
science	1
which	1
could	1
never	1
even	1
step	1
within	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
real	1
knowledge	1
In	1
this	1
mood	1
of	1
mind	1
I	1
betook	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
mathematics	1
and	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
study	1
appertaining	1
to	1
that	1
science	1
as	1
being	1
built	1
upon	1
secure	1
foundations	1
and	1
so	1
worthy	1
of	1
my	1
consideration	1
Thus	1
strangely	1
are	1
our	1
souls	1
constructed	1
and	1
by	1
such	1
slight	1
ligaments	1
are	1
we	1
bound	1
to	1
prosperity	1
or	1
ruin	1
When	1
I	1
look	1
back	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
almost	1
miraculous	1
change	1
of	1
inclination	1
and	1
will	1
was	1
the	1
immediate	1
suggestion	1
of	1
the	1
guardian	1
angel	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
the	1
last	1
effort	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
preservation	1
to	1
avert	1
the	1
storm	1
that	1
was	1
even	1
then	1
hanging	1
in	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
envelop	1
me	1
Her	1
victory	1
was	1
announced	1
by	1
an	1
unusual	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
gladness	1
of	1
soul	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
relinquishing	1
of	1
my	1
ancient	1
and	1
latterly	1
tormenting	1
studies	1
It	1
was	1
thus	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
taught	1
to	1
associate	1
evil	1
with	1
their	1
prosecution	1
happiness	1
with	1
their	1
disregard	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
good	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
ineffectual	1
Destiny	1
was	1
too	1
potent	1
and	1
her	1
immutable	1
laws	1
had	1
decreed	1
my	1
utter	1
and	1
terrible	1
destruction	1
Chapter	1
3	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
attained	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
seventeen	1
my	1
parents	1
resolved	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
become	1
a	1
student	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
of	1
Ingolstadt	1
I	1
had	1
hitherto	1
attended	1
the	1
schools	1
of	1
Geneva	1
but	1
my	1
father	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
my	1
education	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
other	1
customs	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
My	1
departure	1
was	1
therefore	1
fixed	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
date	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
resolved	1
upon	1
could	1
arrive	1
the	1
first	1
misfortune	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
occurred	1
an	1
omen	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
my	1
future	1
misery	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
caught	1
the	1
scarlet	1
fever	1
her	1
illness	1
was	1
severe	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
During	1
her	1
illness	1
many	1
arguments	1
had	1
been	1
urged	1
to	1
persuade	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
attending	1
upon	1
her	1
She	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
yielded	1
to	1
our	1
entreaties	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
her	1
favourite	1
was	1
menaced	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
control	1
her	1
anxiety	1
She	1
attended	1
her	1
sickbed	1
her	1
watchful	1
attentions	1
triumphed	1
over	1
the	1
malignity	1
of	1
the	1
distemper	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
saved	1
but	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
this	1
imprudence	1
were	1
fatal	1
to	1
her	1
preserver	1
On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
my	1
mother	1
sickened	1
her	1
fever	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
alarming	1
symptoms	1
and	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
her	1
medical	1
attendants	1
prognosticated	1
the	1
worst	1
event	1
On	1
her	1
deathbed	1
the	1
fortitude	1
and	1
benignity	1
of	1
this	1
best	1
of	1
women	1
did	1
not	1
desert	1
her	1
She	1
joined	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
myself	1
My	1
children	1
she	1
said	1
my	1
firmest	1
hopes	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
were	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
your	1
union	1
This	1
expectation	1
will	1
now	1
be	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
Elizabeth	1
my	1
love	1
you	1
must	1
supply	1
my	1
place	1
to	1
my	1
younger	1
children	1
Alas	1
I	1
regret	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
happy	1
and	1
beloved	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
hard	1
to	1
quit	1
you	1
all	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
thoughts	1
befitting	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
resign	1
myself	1
cheerfully	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
will	1
indulge	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
meeting	1
you	1
in	1
another	1
world	1
She	1
died	1
calmly	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
affection	1
even	1
in	1
death	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
describe	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
dearest	1
ties	1
are	1
rent	1
by	1
that	1
most	1
irreparable	1
evil	1
the	1
void	1
that	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
the	1
despair	1
that	1
is	1
exhibited	1
on	1
the	1
countenance	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
mind	1
can	1
persuade	1
itself	1
that	1
she	1
whom	1
we	1
saw	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
whose	1
very	1
existence	1
appeared	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
can	1
have	1
departed	1
for	1
ever	1
that	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
a	1
beloved	1
eye	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
extinguished	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
voice	1
so	1
familiar	1
and	1
dear	1
to	1
the	1
ear	1
can	1
be	1
hushed	1
never	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
reflections	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
time	1
proves	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
then	1
the	1
actual	1
bitterness	1
of	1
grief	1
commences	1
Yet	1
from	1
whom	1
has	1
not	1
that	1
rude	1
hand	1
rent	1
away	1
some	1
dear	1
connection	1
And	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
describe	1
a	1
sorrow	1
which	1
all	1
have	1
felt	1
and	1
must	1
feel	1
The	1
time	1
at	1
length	1
arrives	1
when	1
grief	1
is	1
rather	1
an	1
indulgence	1
than	1
a	1
necessity	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
that	1
plays	1
upon	1
the	1
lips	1
although	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
a	1
sacrilege	1
is	1
not	1
banished	1
My	1
mother	1
was	1
dead	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
still	1
duties	1
which	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
perform	1
we	1
must	1
continue	1
our	1
course	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
learn	1
to	1
think	1
ourselves	1
fortunate	1
whilst	1
one	1
remains	1
whom	1
the	1
spoiler	1
has	1
not	1
seized	1
My	1
departure	1
for	1
Ingolstadt	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
deferred	1
by	1
these	1
events	1
was	1
now	1
again	1
determined	1
upon	1
I	1
obtained	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
a	1
respite	1
of	1
some	1
weeks	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
sacrilege	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
repose	1
akin	1
to	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning	1
and	1
to	1
rush	1
into	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
life	1
I	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
sorrow	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
alarm	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
I	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
sweet	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
consoled	1
She	1
indeed	1
veiled	1
her	1
grief	1
and	1
strove	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
comforter	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
She	1
looked	1
steadily	1
on	1
life	1
and	1
assumed	1
its	1
duties	1
with	1
courage	1
and	1
zeal	1
She	1
devoted	1
herself	1
to	1
those	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
cousins	1
Never	1
was	1
she	1
so	1
enchanting	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
sunshine	1
of	1
her	1
smiles	1
and	1
spent	1
them	1
upon	1
us	1
She	1
forgot	1
even	1
her	1
own	1
regret	1
in	1
her	1
endeavours	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
forget	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
at	1
length	1
arrived	1
Clerval	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
with	1
us	1
He	1
had	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
persuade	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
accompany	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
become	1
my	1
fellow	1
student	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
His	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
narrow	1
minded	1
trader	1
and	1
saw	1
idleness	1
and	1
ruin	1
in	1
the	1
aspirations	1
and	1
ambition	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
Henry	1
deeply	1
felt	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
being	1
debarred	1
from	1
a	1
liberal	1
education	1
He	1
said	1
little	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
I	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
kindling	1
eye	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
animated	1
glance	1
a	1
restrained	1
but	1
firm	1
resolve	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
chained	1
to	1
the	1
miserable	1
details	1
of	1
commerce	1
We	1
sat	1
late	1
We	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
ourselves	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
nor	1
persuade	1
ourselves	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
Farewell	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
and	1
we	1
retired	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
seeking	1
repose	1
each	1
fancying	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
deceived	1
but	1
when	1
at	1
morning	1
s	1
dawn	1
I	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
me	1
away	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
there	1
my	1
father	1
again	1
to	1
bless	1
me	1
Clerval	1
to	1
press	1
my	1
hand	1
once	1
more	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
renew	1
her	1
entreaties	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
write	1
often	1
and	1
to	1
bestow	1
the	1
last	1
feminine	1
attentions	1
on	1
her	1
playmate	1
and	1
friend	1
I	1
threw	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
chaise	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
me	1
away	1
and	1
indulged	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
melancholy	1
reflections	1
I	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
surrounded	1
by	1
amiable	1
companions	1
continually	1
engaged	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
bestow	1
mutual	1
pleasure	1
I	1
was	1
now	1
alone	1
In	1
the	1
university	1
whither	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
I	1
must	1
form	1
my	1
own	1
friends	1
and	1
be	1
my	1
own	1
protector	1
My	1
life	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
remarkably	1
secluded	1
and	1
domestic	1
and	1
this	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
invincible	1
repugnance	1
to	1
new	1
countenances	1
I	1
loved	1
my	1
brothers	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Clerval	1
these	1
were	1
old	1
familiar	1
faces	1
but	1
I	1
believed	1
myself	1
totally	1
unfitted	1
for	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
strangers	1
Such	1
were	1
my	1
reflections	1
as	1
I	1
commenced	1
my	1
journey	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
proceeded	1
my	1
spirits	1
and	1
hopes	1
rose	1
I	1
ardently	1
desired	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
knowledge	1
I	1
had	1
often	1
when	1
at	1
home	1
thought	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
remain	1
during	1
my	1
youth	1
cooped	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
and	1
had	1
longed	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
take	1
my	1
station	1
among	1
other	1
human	1
beings	1
Now	1
my	1
desires	1
were	1
complied	1
with	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
folly	1
to	1
repent	1
I	1
had	1
sufficient	1
leisure	1
for	1
these	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
reflections	1
during	1
my	1
journey	1
to	1
Ingolstadt	1
which	1
was	1
long	1
and	1
fatiguing	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
high	1
white	1
steeple	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
met	1
my	1
eyes	1
I	1
alighted	1
and	1
was	1
conducted	1
to	1
my	1
solitary	1
apartment	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
I	1
pleased	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
I	1
delivered	1
my	1
letters	1
of	1
introduction	1
and	1
paid	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
professors	1
Chance	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
evil	1
influence	1
the	1
Angel	1
of	1
Destruction	1
which	1
asserted	1
omnipotent	1
sway	1
over	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
I	1
turned	1
my	1
reluctant	1
steps	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
door	1
led	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
M	1
Krempe	1
professor	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
uncouth	1
man	1
but	1
deeply	1
imbued	1
in	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
science	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
several	1
questions	1
concerning	1
my	1
progress	1
in	1
the	1
different	1
branches	1
of	1
science	1
appertaining	1
to	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
I	1
replied	1
carelessly	1
and	1
partly	1
in	1
contempt	1
mentioned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
my	1
alchemists	1
as	1
the	1
principal	1
authors	1
I	1
had	1
studied	1
The	1
professor	1
stared	1
Have	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
really	1
spent	1
your	1
time	1
in	1
studying	1
such	1
nonsense	1
I	1
replied	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
Every	1
minute	1
continued	1
M	1
Krempe	1
with	1
warmth	1
every	1
instant	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
wasted	1
on	1
those	1
books	1
is	1
utterly	1
and	1
entirely	1
lost	1
You	1
have	1
burdened	1
your	1
memory	1
with	1
exploded	1
systems	1
and	1
useless	1
names	1
Good	1
God	1
In	1
what	1
desert	1
land	1
have	1
you	1
lived	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
these	1
fancies	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
greedily	1
imbibed	1
are	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
as	1
musty	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
ancient	1
I	1
little	1
expected	1
in	1
this	1
enlightened	1
and	1
scientific	1
age	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
Albertus	1
Magnus	1
and	1
Paracelsus	1
My	1
dear	1
sir	1
you	1
must	1
begin	1
your	1
studies	1
entirely	1
anew	1
So	1
saying	1
he	1
stepped	1
aside	1
and	1
wrote	1
down	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
several	1
books	1
treating	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
which	1
he	1
desired	1
me	1
to	1
procure	1
and	1
dismissed	1
me	1
after	1
mentioning	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
week	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
commence	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
lectures	1
upon	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
in	1
its	1
general	1
relations	1
and	1
that	1
M	1
Waldman	1
a	1
fellow	1
professor	1
would	1
lecture	1
upon	1
chemistry	1
the	1
alternate	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
omitted	1
I	1
returned	1
home	1
not	1
disappointed	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
long	1
considered	1
those	1
authors	1
useless	1
whom	1
the	1
professor	1
reprobated	1
but	1
I	1
returned	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
these	1
studies	1
in	1
any	1
shape	1
M	1
Krempe	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
squat	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
gruff	1
voice	1
and	1
a	1
repulsive	1
countenance	1
the	1
teacher	1
therefore	1
did	1
not	1
prepossess	1
me	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits	1
In	1
rather	1
a	1
too	1
philosophical	1
and	1
connected	1
a	1
strain	1
perhaps	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
conclusions	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
concerning	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
early	1
years	1
As	1
a	1
child	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
results	1
promised	1
by	1
the	1
modern	1
professors	1
of	1
natural	1
science	1
With	1
a	1
confusion	1
of	1
ideas	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
accounted	1
for	1
by	1
my	1
extreme	1
youth	1
and	1
my	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
guide	1
on	1
such	1
matters	1
I	1
had	1
retrod	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
knowledge	1
along	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
exchanged	1
the	1
discoveries	1
of	1
recent	1
inquirers	1
for	1
the	1
dreams	1
of	1
forgotten	1
alchemists	1
Besides	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
uses	1
of	1
modern	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
when	1
the	1
masters	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
sought	1
immortality	1
and	1
power	1
such	1
views	1
although	1
futile	1
were	1
grand	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
scene	1
was	1
changed	1
The	1
ambition	1
of	1
the	1
inquirer	1
seemed	1
to	1
limit	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
annihilation	1
of	1
those	1
visions	1
on	1
which	1
my	1
interest	1
in	1
science	1
was	1
chiefly	1
founded	1
I	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
exchange	1
chimeras	1
of	1
boundless	1
grandeur	1
for	1
realities	1
of	1
little	1
worth	1
Such	1
were	1
my	1
reflections	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
residence	1
at	1
Ingolstadt	1
which	1
were	1
chiefly	1
spent	1
in	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
localities	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
residents	1
in	1
my	1
new	1
abode	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
ensuing	1
week	1
commenced	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
information	1
which	1
M	1
Krempe	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
concerning	1
the	1
lectures	1
And	1
although	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
hear	1
that	1
little	1
conceited	1
fellow	1
deliver	1
sentences	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pulpit	1
I	1
recollected	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
M	1
Waldman	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
Partly	1
from	1
curiosity	1
and	1
partly	1
from	1
idleness	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
lecturing	1
room	1
which	1
M	1
Waldman	1
entered	1
shortly	1
after	1
This	1
professor	1
was	1
very	1
unlike	1
his	1
colleague	1
He	1
appeared	1
about	1
fifty	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
aspect	1
expressive	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
benevolence	1
a	1
few	1
grey	1
hairs	1
covered	1
his	1
temples	1
but	1
those	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
were	1
nearly	1
black	1
His	1
person	1
was	1
short	1
but	1
remarkably	1
erect	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
the	1
sweetest	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
He	1
began	1
his	1
lecture	1
by	1
a	1
recapitulation	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
chemistry	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
improvements	1
made	1
by	1
different	1
men	1
of	1
learning	1
pronouncing	1
with	1
fervour	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
discoverers	1
He	1
then	1
took	1
a	1
cursory	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
and	1
explained	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
elementary	1
terms	1
After	1
having	1
made	1
a	1
few	1
preparatory	1
experiments	1
he	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
panegyric	1
upon	1
modern	1
chemistry	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
The	1
ancient	1
teachers	1
of	1
this	1
science	1
said	1
he	1
promised	1
impossibilities	1
and	1
performed	1
nothing	1
The	1
modern	1
masters	1
promise	1
very	1
little	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
metals	1
cannot	1
be	1
transmuted	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
elixir	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
chimera	1
but	1
these	1
philosophers	1
whose	1
hands	1
seem	1
only	1
made	1
to	1
dabble	1
in	1
dirt	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
to	1
pore	1
over	1
the	1
microscope	1
or	1
crucible	1
have	1
indeed	1
performed	1
miracles	1
They	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
recesses	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
show	1
how	1
she	1
works	1
in	1
her	1
hiding	1
places	1
They	1
ascend	1
into	1
the	1
heavens	1
they	1
have	1
discovered	1
how	1
the	1
blood	1
circulates	1
and	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
we	1
breathe	1
They	1
have	1
acquired	1
new	1
and	1
almost	1
unlimited	1
powers	1
they	1
can	1
command	1
the	1
thunders	1
of	1
heaven	1
mimic	1
the	1
earthquake	1
and	1
even	1
mock	1
the	1
invisible	1
world	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
shadows	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
professor	1
s	1
words	1
rather	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
such	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
enounced	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
my	1
soul	1
were	1
grappling	1
with	1
a	1
palpable	1
enemy	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
various	1
keys	1
were	1
touched	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
chord	1
after	1
chord	1
was	1
sounded	1
and	1
soon	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
one	1
thought	1
one	1
conception	1
one	1
purpose	1
So	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
Frankenstein	1
more	1
far	1
more	1
will	1
I	1
achieve	1
treading	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
already	1
marked	1
I	1
will	1
pioneer	1
a	1
new	1
way	1
explore	1
unknown	1
powers	1
and	1
unfold	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
deepest	1
mysteries	1
of	1
creation	1
I	1
closed	1
not	1
my	1
eyes	1
that	1
night	1
My	1
internal	1
being	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
insurrection	1
and	1
turmoil	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
order	1
would	1
thence	1
arise	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
produce	1
it	1
By	1
degrees	1
after	1
the	1
morning	1
s	1
dawn	1
sleep	1
came	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
my	1
yesternight	1
s	1
thoughts	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
dream	1
There	1
only	1
remained	1
a	1
resolution	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
ancient	1
studies	1
and	1
to	1
devote	1
myself	1
to	1
a	1
science	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
believed	1
myself	1
to	1
possess	1
a	1
natural	1
talent	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
I	1
paid	1
M	1
Waldman	1
a	1
visit	1
His	1
manners	1
in	1
private	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
mild	1
and	1
attractive	1
than	1
in	1
public	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
mien	1
during	1
his	1
lecture	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
greatest	1
affability	1
and	1
kindness	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
pursuits	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
fellow	1
professor	1
He	1
heard	1
with	1
attention	1
the	1
little	1
narration	1
concerning	1
my	1
studies	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Cornelius	1
Agrippa	1
and	1
Paracelsus	1
but	1
without	1
the	1
contempt	1
that	1
M	1
Krempe	1
had	1
exhibited	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
These	1
were	1
men	1
to	1
whose	1
indefatigable	1
zeal	1
modern	1
philosophers	1
were	1
indebted	1
for	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
their	1
knowledge	1
They	1
had	1
left	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
an	1
easier	1
task	1
to	1
give	1
new	1
names	1
and	1
arrange	1
in	1
connected	1
classifications	1
the	1
facts	1
which	1
they	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
bringing	1
to	1
light	1
The	1
labours	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
genius	1
however	1
erroneously	1
directed	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
fail	1
in	1
ultimately	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
solid	1
advantage	1
of	1
mankind	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
statement	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
without	1
any	1
presumption	1
or	1
affectation	1
and	1
then	1
added	1
that	1
his	1
lecture	1
had	1
removed	1
my	1
prejudices	1
against	1
modern	1
chemists	1
I	1
expressed	1
myself	1
in	1
measured	1
terms	1
with	1
the	1
modesty	1
and	1
deference	1
due	1
from	1
a	1
youth	1
to	1
his	1
instructor	1
without	1
letting	1
escape	1
inexperience	1
in	1
life	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
ashamed	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
stimulated	1
my	1
intended	1
labours	1
I	1
requested	1
his	1
advice	1
concerning	1
the	1
books	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
procure	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
said	1
M	1
Waldman	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
a	1
disciple	1
and	1
if	1
your	1
application	1
equals	1
your	1
ability	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
your	1
success	1
Chemistry	1
is	1
that	1
branch	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
greatest	1
improvements	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
my	1
peculiar	1
study	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
neglected	1
the	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
science	1
A	1
man	1
would	1
make	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
sorry	1
chemist	1
if	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
that	1
department	1
of	1
human	1
knowledge	1
alone	1
If	1
your	1
wish	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
really	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
petty	1
experimentalist	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
every	1
branch	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
including	1
mathematics	1
He	1
then	1
took	1
me	1
into	1
his	1
laboratory	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
uses	1
of	1
his	1
various	1
machines	1
instructing	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
procure	1
and	1
promising	1
me	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
advanced	1
far	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
not	1
to	1
derange	1
their	1
mechanism	1
He	1
also	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
books	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
requested	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
leave	1
Thus	1
ended	1
a	1
day	1
memorable	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
decided	1
my	1
future	1
destiny	1
Chapter	1
4	1
From	1
this	1
day	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
and	1
particularly	1
chemistry	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
comprehensive	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
became	1
nearly	1
my	1
sole	1
occupation	1
I	1
read	1
with	1
ardour	1
those	1
works	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
genius	1
and	1
discrimination	1
which	1
modern	1
inquirers	1
have	1
written	1
on	1
these	1
subjects	1
I	1
attended	1
the	1
lectures	1
and	1
cultivated	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
even	1
in	1
M	1
Krempe	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
sound	1
sense	1
and	1
real	1
information	1
combined	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
with	1
a	1
repulsive	1
physiognomy	1
and	1
manners	1
but	1
not	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
the	1
less	1
valuable	1
In	1
M	1
Waldman	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
His	1
gentleness	1
was	1
never	1
tinged	1
by	1
dogmatism	1
and	1
his	1
instructions	1
were	1
given	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
frankness	1
and	1
good	1
nature	1
that	1
banished	1
every	1
idea	1
of	1
pedantry	1
In	1
a	1
thousand	1
ways	1
he	1
smoothed	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
most	1
abstruse	1
inquiries	1
clear	1
and	1
facile	1
to	1
my	1
apprehension	1
My	1
application	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
fluctuating	1
and	1
uncertain	1
it	1
gained	1
strength	1
as	1
I	1
proceeded	1
and	1
soon	1
became	1
so	1
ardent	1
and	1
eager	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
often	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
morning	1
whilst	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
engaged	1
in	1
my	1
laboratory	1
As	1
I	1
applied	1
so	1
closely	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
conceived	1
that	1
my	1
progress	1
was	1
rapid	1
My	1
ardour	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
students	1
and	1
my	1
proficiency	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
masters	1
Professor	1
Krempe	1
often	1
asked	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
smile	1
how	1
Cornelius	1
Agrippa	1
went	1
on	1
whilst	1
M	1
Waldman	1
expressed	1
the	1
most	1
heartfelt	1
exultation	1
in	1
my	1
progress	1
Two	1
years	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
during	1
which	1
I	1
paid	1
no	1
visit	1
to	1
Geneva	1
but	1
was	1
engaged	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
some	1
discoveries	1
which	1
I	1
hoped	1
to	1
make	1
None	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
experienced	1
them	1
can	1
conceive	1
of	1
the	1
enticements	1
of	1
science	1
In	1
other	1
studies	1
you	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
others	1
have	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
know	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
scientific	1
pursuit	1
there	1
is	1
continual	1
food	1
for	1
discovery	1
and	1
wonder	1
A	1
mind	1
of	1
moderate	1
capacity	1
which	1
closely	1
pursues	1
one	1
study	1
must	1
infallibly	1
arrive	1
at	1
great	1
proficiency	1
in	1
that	1
study	1
and	1
I	1
who	1
continually	1
sought	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
one	1
object	1
of	1
pursuit	1
and	1
was	1
solely	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
improved	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
I	1
made	1
some	1
discoveries	1
in	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
some	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
which	1
procured	1
me	1
great	1
esteem	1
and	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
arrived	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
as	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
theory	1
and	1
practice	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
as	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
professors	1
at	1
Ingolstadt	1
my	1
residence	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
longer	1
conducive	1
to	1
my	1
improvements	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
when	1
an	1
incident	1
happened	1
that	1
protracted	1
my	1
stay	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
phenomena	1
which	1
had	1
peculiarly	1
attracted	1
my	1
attention	1
was	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
and	1
indeed	1
any	1
animal	1
endued	1
with	1
life	1
Whence	1
I	1
often	1
asked	1
myself	1
did	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
life	1
proceed	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bold	1
question	1
and	1
one	1
which	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
mystery	1
yet	1
with	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
are	1
we	1
upon	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
if	1
cowardice	1
or	1
carelessness	1
did	1
not	1
restrain	1
our	1
inquiries	1
I	1
revolved	1
these	1
circumstances	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
determined	1
thenceforth	1
to	1
apply	1
myself	1
more	1
particularly	1
to	1
those	1
branches	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
which	1
relate	1
to	1
physiology	1
Unless	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
animated	1
by	1
an	1
almost	1
supernatural	1
enthusiasm	1
my	1
application	1
to	1
this	1
study	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
irksome	1
and	1
almost	1
intolerable	1
To	1
examine	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
life	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
death	1
I	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
anatomy	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
sufficient	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
observe	1
the	1
natural	1
decay	1
and	1
corruption	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
body	1
In	1
my	1
education	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
greatest	1
precautions	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
should	1
be	1
impressed	1
with	1
no	1
supernatural	1
horrors	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
ever	1
remember	1
to	1
have	1
trembled	1
at	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
superstition	1
or	1
to	1
have	1
feared	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
a	1
spirit	1
Darkness	1
had	1
no	1
effect	1
upon	1
my	1
fancy	1
and	1
a	1
churchyard	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
merely	1
the	1
receptacle	1
of	1
bodies	1
deprived	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
from	1
being	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
strength	1
had	1
become	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
worm	1
Now	1
I	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
cause	1
and	1
progress	1
of	1
this	1
decay	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
spend	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
in	1
vaults	1
and	1
charnel	1
houses	1
My	1
attention	1
was	1
fixed	1
upon	1
every	1
object	1
the	1
most	1
insupportable	1
to	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
feelings	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
fine	1
form	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
degraded	1
and	1
wasted	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
corruption	1
of	1
death	1
succeed	1
to	1
the	1
blooming	1
cheek	1
of	1
life	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
worm	1
inherited	1
the	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
brain	1
I	1
paused	1
examining	1
and	1
analysing	1
all	1
the	1
minutiae	1
of	1
causation	1
as	1
exemplified	1
in	1
the	1
change	1
from	1
life	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
death	1
to	1
life	1
until	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
darkness	1
a	1
sudden	1
light	1
broke	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
a	1
light	1
so	1
brilliant	1
and	1
wondrous	1
yet	1
so	1
simple	1
that	1
while	1
I	1
became	1
dizzy	1
with	1
the	1
immensity	1
of	1
the	1
prospect	1
which	1
it	1
illustrated	1
I	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
among	1
so	1
many	1
men	1
of	1
genius	1
who	1
had	1
directed	1
their	1
inquiries	1
towards	1
the	1
same	1
science	1
that	1
I	1
alone	1
should	1
be	1
reserved	1
to	1
discover	1
so	1
astonishing	1
a	1
secret	1
Remember	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
recording	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
The	1
sun	1
does	1
not	1
more	1
certainly	1
shine	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
affirm	1
is	1
true	1
Some	1
miracle	1
might	1
have	1
produced	1
it	1
yet	1
the	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
were	1
distinct	1
and	1
probable	1
After	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
of	1
incredible	1
labour	1
and	1
fatigue	1
I	1
succeeded	1
in	1
discovering	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
generation	1
and	1
life	1
nay	1
more	1
I	1
became	1
myself	1
capable	1
of	1
bestowing	1
animation	1
upon	1
lifeless	1
matter	1
The	1
astonishment	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
experienced	1
on	1
this	1
discovery	1
soon	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
delight	1
and	1
rapture	1
After	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
spent	1
in	1
painful	1
labour	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
my	1
desires	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
gratifying	1
consummation	1
of	1
my	1
toils	1
But	1
this	1
discovery	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
overwhelming	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
steps	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
progressively	1
led	1
to	1
it	1
were	1
obliterated	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
only	1
the	1
result	1
What	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
wisest	1
men	1
since	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
now	1
within	1
my	1
grasp	1
Not	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
magic	1
scene	1
it	1
all	1
opened	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
information	1
I	1
had	1
obtained	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
rather	1
to	1
direct	1
my	1
endeavours	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
point	1
them	1
towards	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
search	1
than	1
to	1
exhibit	1
that	1
object	1
already	1
accomplished	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
Arabian	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
buried	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
passage	1
to	1
life	1
aided	1
only	1
by	1
one	1
glimmering	1
and	1
seemingly	1
ineffectual	1
light	1
I	1
see	1
by	1
your	1
eagerness	1
and	1
the	1
wonder	1
and	1
hope	1
which	1
your	1
eyes	1
express	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
acquainted	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
listen	1
patiently	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
easily	1
perceive	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
reserved	1
upon	1
that	1
subject	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
lead	1
you	1
on	1
unguarded	1
and	1
ardent	1
as	1
I	1
then	1
was	1
to	1
your	1
destruction	1
and	1
infallible	1
misery	1
Learn	1
from	1
me	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
my	1
precepts	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
my	1
example	1
how	1
dangerous	1
is	1
the	1
acquirement	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
happier	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
who	1
believes	1
his	1
native	1
town	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
aspires	1
to	1
become	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
nature	1
will	1
allow	1
When	1
I	1
found	1
so	1
astonishing	1
a	1
power	1
placed	1
within	1
my	1
hands	1
I	1
hesitated	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
concerning	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
employ	1
it	1
Although	1
I	1
possessed	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
bestowing	1
animation	1
yet	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
frame	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
intricacies	1
of	1
fibres	1
muscles	1
and	1
veins	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
inconceivable	1
difficulty	1
and	1
labour	1
I	1
doubted	1
at	1
first	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
attempt	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
being	1
like	1
myself	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
simpler	1
organization	1
but	1
my	1
imagination	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
exalted	1
by	1
my	1
first	1
success	1
to	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
to	1
give	1
life	1
to	1
an	1
animal	1
as	1
complex	1
and	1
wonderful	1
as	1
man	1
The	1
materials	1
at	1
present	1
within	1
my	1
command	1
hardly	1
appeared	1
adequate	1
to	1
so	1
arduous	1
an	1
undertaking	1
but	1
I	1
doubted	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
ultimately	1
succeed	1
I	1
prepared	1
myself	1
for	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
reverses	1
my	1
operations	1
might	1
be	1
incessantly	1
baffled	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
my	1
work	1
be	1
imperfect	1
yet	1
when	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
improvement	1
which	1
every	1
day	1
takes	1
place	1
in	1
science	1
and	1
mechanics	1
I	1
was	1
encouraged	1
to	1
hope	1
my	1
present	1
attempts	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
lay	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
future	1
success	1
Nor	1
could	1
I	1
consider	1
the	1
magnitude	1
and	1
complexity	1
of	1
my	1
plan	1
as	1
any	1
argument	1
of	1
its	1
impracticability	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
these	1
feelings	1
that	1
I	1
began	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
As	1
the	1
minuteness	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
formed	1
a	1
great	1
hindrance	1
to	1
my	1
speed	1
I	1
resolved	1
contrary	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
intention	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
eight	1
feet	1
in	1
height	1
and	1
proportionably	1
large	1
After	1
having	1
formed	1
this	1
determination	1
and	1
having	1
spent	1
some	1
months	1
in	1
successfully	1
collecting	1
and	1
arranging	1
my	1
materials	1
I	1
began	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
conceive	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
feelings	1
which	1
bore	1
me	1
onwards	1
like	1
a	1
hurricane	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
success	1
Life	1
and	1
death	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
ideal	1
bounds	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
first	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
pour	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
light	1
into	1
our	1
dark	1
world	1
A	1
new	1
species	1
would	1
bless	1
me	1
as	1
its	1
creator	1
and	1
source	1
many	1
happy	1
and	1
excellent	1
natures	1
would	1
owe	1
their	1
being	1
to	1
me	1
No	1
father	1
could	1
claim	1
the	1
gratitude	1
of	1
his	1
child	1
so	1
completely	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
deserve	1
theirs	1
Pursuing	1
these	1
reflections	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
bestow	1
animation	1
upon	1
lifeless	1
matter	1
I	1
might	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
although	1
I	1
now	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
renew	1
life	1
where	1
death	1
had	1
apparently	1
devoted	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
corruption	1
These	1
thoughts	1
supported	1
my	1
spirits	1
while	1
I	1
pursued	1
my	1
undertaking	1
with	1
unremitting	1
ardour	1
My	1
cheek	1
had	1
grown	1
pale	1
with	1
study	1
and	1
my	1
person	1
had	1
become	1
emaciated	1
with	1
confinement	1
Sometimes	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
brink	1
of	1
certainty	1
I	1
failed	1
yet	1
still	1
I	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
or	1
the	1
next	1
hour	1
might	1
realise	1
One	1
secret	1
which	1
I	1
alone	1
possessed	1
was	1
the	1
hope	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
dedicated	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
gazed	1
on	1
my	1
midnight	1
labours	1
while	1
with	1
unrelaxed	1
and	1
breathless	1
eagerness	1
I	1
pursued	1
nature	1
to	1
her	1
hiding	1
places	1
Who	1
shall	1
conceive	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
my	1
secret	1
toil	1
as	1
I	1
dabbled	1
among	1
the	1
unhallowed	1
damps	1
of	1
the	1
grave	1
or	1
tortured	1
the	1
living	1
animal	1
to	1
animate	1
the	1
lifeless	1
clay	1
My	1
limbs	1
now	1
tremble	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
swim	1
with	1
the	1
remembrance	1
but	1
then	1
a	1
resistless	1
and	1
almost	1
frantic	1
impulse	1
urged	1
me	1
forward	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
all	1
soul	1
or	1
sensation	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
pursuit	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
but	1
a	1
passing	1
trance	1
that	1
only	1
made	1
me	1
feel	1
with	1
renewed	1
acuteness	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
unnatural	1
stimulus	1
ceasing	1
to	1
operate	1
I	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
habits	1
I	1
collected	1
bones	1
from	1
charnel	1
houses	1
and	1
disturbed	1
with	1
profane	1
fingers	1
the	1
tremendous	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
In	1
a	1
solitary	1
chamber	1
or	1
rather	1
cell	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
separated	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
apartments	1
by	1
a	1
gallery	1
and	1
staircase	1
I	1
kept	1
my	1
workshop	1
of	1
filthy	1
creation	1
my	1
eyeballs	1
were	1
starting	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
my	1
employment	1
The	1
dissecting	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
slaughter	1
house	1
furnished	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
materials	1
and	1
often	1
did	1
my	1
human	1
nature	1
turn	1
with	1
loathing	1
from	1
my	1
occupation	1
whilst	1
still	1
urged	1
on	1
by	1
an	1
eagerness	1
which	1
perpetually	1
increased	1
I	1
brought	1
my	1
work	1
near	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion	1
The	1
summer	1
months	1
passed	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
thus	1
engaged	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
in	1
one	1
pursuit	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
season	1
never	1
did	1
the	1
fields	1
bestow	1
a	1
more	1
plentiful	1
harvest	1
or	1
the	1
vines	1
yield	1
a	1
more	1
luxuriant	1
vintage	1
but	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
insensible	1
to	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
nature	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
neglect	1
the	1
scenes	1
around	1
me	1
caused	1
me	1
also	1
to	1
forget	1
those	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
miles	1
absent	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time	1
I	1
knew	1
my	1
silence	1
disquieted	1
them	1
and	1
I	1
well	1
remembered	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
pleased	1
with	1
yourself	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
affection	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
hear	1
regularly	1
from	1
you	1
You	1
must	1
pardon	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
regard	1
any	1
interruption	1
in	1
your	1
correspondence	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
that	1
your	1
other	1
duties	1
are	1
equally	1
neglected	1
I	1
knew	1
well	1
therefore	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
feelings	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
my	1
thoughts	1
from	1
my	1
employment	1
loathsome	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
an	1
irresistible	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
imagination	1
I	1
wished	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
procrastinate	1
all	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
my	1
feelings	1
of	1
affection	1
until	1
the	1
great	1
object	1
which	1
swallowed	1
up	1
every	1
habit	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
should	1
be	1
completed	1
I	1
then	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
would	1
be	1
unjust	1
if	1
he	1
ascribed	1
my	1
neglect	1
to	1
vice	1
or	1
faultiness	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
justified	1
in	1
conceiving	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
altogether	1
free	1
from	1
blame	1
A	1
human	1
being	1
in	1
perfection	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
calm	1
and	1
peaceful	1
mind	1
and	1
never	1
to	1
allow	1
passion	1
or	1
a	1
transitory	1
desire	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
tranquillity	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
knowledge	1
is	1
an	1
exception	1
to	1
this	1
rule	1
If	1
the	1
study	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
apply	1
yourself	1
has	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
weaken	1
your	1
affections	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
your	1
taste	1
for	1
those	1
simple	1
pleasures	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
alloy	1
can	1
possibly	1
mix	1
then	1
that	1
study	1
is	1
certainly	1
unlawful	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
not	1
befitting	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
If	1
this	1
rule	1
were	1
always	1
observed	1
if	1
no	1
man	1
allowed	1
any	1
pursuit	1
whatsoever	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
his	1
domestic	1
affections	1
Greece	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
enslaved	1
Caesar	1
would	1
have	1
spared	1
his	1
country	1
America	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
discovered	1
more	1
gradually	1
and	1
the	1
empires	1
of	1
Mexico	1
and	1
Peru	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
destroyed	1
But	1
I	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
moralizing	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
tale	1
and	1
your	1
looks	1
remind	1
me	1
to	1
proceed	1
My	1
father	1
made	1
no	1
reproach	1
in	1
his	1
letters	1
and	1
only	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
my	1
silence	1
by	1
inquiring	1
into	1
my	1
occupations	1
more	1
particularly	1
than	1
before	1
Winter	1
spring	1
and	1
summer	1
passed	1
away	1
during	1
my	1
labours	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
watch	1
the	1
blossom	1
or	1
the	1
expanding	1
leaves	1
sights	1
which	1
before	1
always	1
yielded	1
me	1
supreme	1
delight	1
so	1
deeply	1
was	1
I	1
engrossed	1
in	1
my	1
occupation	1
The	1
leaves	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
had	1
withered	1
before	1
my	1
work	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
now	1
every	1
day	1
showed	1
me	1
more	1
plainly	1
how	1
well	1
I	1
had	1
succeeded	1
But	1
my	1
enthusiasm	1
was	1
checked	1
by	1
my	1
anxiety	1
and	1
I	1
appeared	1
rather	1
like	1
one	1
doomed	1
by	1
slavery	1
to	1
toil	1
in	1
the	1
mines	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
unwholesome	1
trade	1
than	1
an	1
artist	1
occupied	1
by	1
his	1
favourite	1
employment	1
Every	1
night	1
I	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
a	1
slow	1
fever	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
nervous	1
to	1
a	1
most	1
painful	1
degree	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
a	1
leaf	1
startled	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
shunned	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
a	1
crime	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
grew	1
alarmed	1
at	1
the	1
wreck	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
my	1
purpose	1
alone	1
sustained	1
me	1
my	1
labours	1
would	1
soon	1
end	1
and	1
I	1
believed	1
that	1
exercise	1
and	1
amusement	1
would	1
then	1
drive	1
away	1
incipient	1
disease	1
and	1
I	1
promised	1
myself	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
when	1
my	1
creation	1
should	1
be	1
complete	1
Chapter	1
5	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
dreary	1
night	1
of	1
November	1
that	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
my	1
toils	1
With	1
an	1
anxiety	1
that	1
almost	1
amounted	1
to	1
agony	1
I	1
collected	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
life	1
around	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
infuse	1
a	1
spark	1
of	1
being	1
into	1
the	1
lifeless	1
thing	1
that	1
lay	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
rain	1
pattered	1
dismally	1
against	1
the	1
panes	1
and	1
my	1
candle	1
was	1
nearly	1
burnt	1
out	1
when	1
by	1
the	1
glimmer	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
extinguished	1
light	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dull	1
yellow	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
open	1
it	1
breathed	1
hard	1
and	1
a	1
convulsive	1
motion	1
agitated	1
its	1
limbs	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
describe	1
my	1
emotions	1
at	1
this	1
catastrophe	1
or	1
how	1
delineate	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
with	1
such	1
infinite	1
pains	1
and	1
care	1
I	1
had	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
form	1
His	1
limbs	1
were	1
in	1
proportion	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
selected	1
his	1
features	1
as	1
beautiful	1
Beautiful	1
Great	1
God	1
His	1
yellow	1
skin	1
scarcely	1
covered	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
muscles	1
and	1
arteries	1
beneath	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
lustrous	1
black	1
and	1
flowing	1
his	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
pearly	1
whiteness	1
but	1
these	1
luxuriances	1
only	1
formed	1
a	1
more	1
horrid	1
contrast	1
with	1
his	1
watery	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
almost	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
colour	1
as	1
the	1
dun	1
white	1
sockets	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
set	1
his	1
shrivelled	1
complexion	1
and	1
straight	1
black	1
lips	1
The	1
different	1
accidents	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
changeable	1
as	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
I	1
had	1
worked	1
hard	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
purpose	1
of	1
infusing	1
life	1
into	1
an	1
inanimate	1
body	1
For	1
this	1
I	1
had	1
deprived	1
myself	1
of	1
rest	1
and	1
health	1
I	1
had	1
desired	1
it	1
with	1
an	1
ardour	1
that	1
far	1
exceeded	1
moderation	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
dream	1
vanished	1
and	1
breathless	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
filled	1
my	1
heart	1
Unable	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
being	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
I	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
continued	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
traversing	1
my	1
bed	1
chamber	1
unable	1
to	1
compose	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
sleep	1
At	1
length	1
lassitude	1
succeeded	1
to	1
the	1
tumult	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
endured	1
and	1
I	1
threw	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
my	1
clothes	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
seek	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
of	1
forgetfulness	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
I	1
slept	1
indeed	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
wildest	1
dreams	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
saw	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
health	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Ingolstadt	1
Delighted	1
and	1
surprised	1
I	1
embraced	1
her	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
imprinted	1
the	1
first	1
kiss	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
they	1
became	1
livid	1
with	1
the	1
hue	1
of	1
death	1
her	1
features	1
appeared	1
to	1
change	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
held	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
my	1
dead	1
mother	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
a	1
shroud	1
enveloped	1
her	1
form	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
grave	1
worms	1
crawling	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
the	1
flannel	1
I	1
started	1
from	1
my	1
sleep	1
with	1
horror	1
a	1
cold	1
dew	1
covered	1
my	1
forehead	1
my	1
teeth	1
chattered	1
and	1
every	1
limb	1
became	1
convulsed	1
when	1
by	1
the	1
dim	1
and	1
yellow	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
as	1
it	1
forced	1
its	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
shutters	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
wretch	1
the	1
miserable	1
monster	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
He	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
if	1
eyes	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
me	1
His	1
jaws	1
opened	1
and	1
he	1
muttered	1
some	1
inarticulate	1
sounds	1
while	1
a	1
grin	1
wrinkled	1
his	1
cheeks	1
He	1
might	1
have	1
spoken	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
one	1
hand	1
was	1
stretched	1
out	1
seemingly	1
to	1
detain	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
escaped	1
and	1
rushed	1
downstairs	1
I	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
inhabited	1
where	1
I	1
remained	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
agitation	1
listening	1
attentively	1
catching	1
and	1
fearing	1
each	1
sound	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
demoniacal	1
corpse	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
miserably	1
given	1
life	1
Oh	1
No	1
mortal	1
could	1
support	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
that	1
countenance	1
A	1
mummy	1
again	1
endued	1
with	1
animation	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
hideous	1
as	1
that	1
wretch	1
I	1
had	1
gazed	1
on	1
him	1
while	1
unfinished	1
he	1
was	1
ugly	1
then	1
but	1
when	1
those	1
muscles	1
and	1
joints	1
were	1
rendered	1
capable	1
of	1
motion	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
thing	1
such	1
as	1
even	1
Dante	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
conceived	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
wretchedly	1
Sometimes	1
my	1
pulse	1
beat	1
so	1
quickly	1
and	1
hardly	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
palpitation	1
of	1
every	1
artery	1
at	1
others	1
I	1
nearly	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
through	1
languor	1
and	1
extreme	1
weakness	1
Mingled	1
with	1
this	1
horror	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
disappointment	1
dreams	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
food	1
and	1
pleasant	1
rest	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
space	1
were	1
now	1
become	1
a	1
hell	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
was	1
so	1
rapid	1
the	1
overthrow	1
so	1
complete	1
Morning	1
dismal	1
and	1
wet	1
at	1
length	1
dawned	1
and	1
discovered	1
to	1
my	1
sleepless	1
and	1
aching	1
eyes	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Ingolstadt	1
its	1
white	1
steeple	1
and	1
clock	1
which	1
indicated	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
The	1
porter	1
opened	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
which	1
had	1
that	1
night	1
been	1
my	1
asylum	1
and	1
I	1
issued	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
pacing	1
them	1
with	1
quick	1
steps	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
sought	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
I	1
feared	1
every	1
turning	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
would	1
present	1
to	1
my	1
view	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
apartment	1
which	1
I	1
inhabited	1
but	1
felt	1
impelled	1
to	1
hurry	1
on	1
although	1
drenched	1
by	1
the	1
rain	1
which	1
poured	1
from	1
a	1
black	1
and	1
comfortless	1
sky	1
I	1
continued	1
walking	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
endeavouring	1
by	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
to	1
ease	1
the	1
load	1
that	1
weighed	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
I	1
traversed	1
the	1
streets	1
without	1
any	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
My	1
heart	1
palpitated	1
in	1
the	1
sickness	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
I	1
hurried	1
on	1
with	1
irregular	1
steps	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
me	1
Like	1
one	1
who	1
on	1
a	1
lonely	1
road	1
Doth	1
walk	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
dread	1
And	1
having	1
once	1
turned	1
round	1
walks	1
on	1
And	1
turns	1
no	1
more	1
his	1
head	1
Because	1
he	1
knows	1
a	1
frightful	1
fiend	1
Doth	1
close	1
behind	1
him	1
tread	1
Coleridge	1
s	1
Ancient	1
Mariner	1
Continuing	1
thus	1
I	1
came	1
at	1
length	1
opposite	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
various	1
diligences	1
and	1
carriages	1
usually	1
stopped	1
Here	1
I	1
paused	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
why	1
but	1
I	1
remained	1
some	1
minutes	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
coach	1
that	1
was	1
coming	1
towards	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
As	1
it	1
drew	1
nearer	1
I	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Swiss	1
diligence	1
it	1
stopped	1
just	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
being	1
opened	1
I	1
perceived	1
Henry	1
Clerval	1
who	1
on	1
seeing	1
me	1
instantly	1
sprung	1
out	1
My	1
dear	1
Frankenstein	1
exclaimed	1
he	1
how	1
glad	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
How	1
fortunate	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
of	1
my	1
alighting	1
Nothing	1
could	1
equal	1
my	1
delight	1
on	1
seeing	1
Clerval	1
his	1
presence	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
thoughts	1
my	1
father	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
scenes	1
of	1
home	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
my	1
recollection	1
I	1
grasped	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
forgot	1
my	1
horror	1
and	1
misfortune	1
I	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
during	1
many	1
months	1
calm	1
and	1
serene	1
joy	1
I	1
welcomed	1
my	1
friend	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
cordial	1
manner	1
and	1
we	1
walked	1
towards	1
my	1
college	1
Clerval	1
continued	1
talking	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
about	1
our	1
mutual	1
friends	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
fortune	1
in	1
being	1
permitted	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Ingolstadt	1
You	1
may	1
easily	1
believe	1
said	1
he	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
difficulty	1
to	1
persuade	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
all	1
necessary	1
knowledge	1
was	1
not	1
comprised	1
in	1
the	1
noble	1
art	1
of	1
book	1
keeping	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
incredulous	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
for	1
his	1
constant	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
unwearied	1
entreaties	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Dutch	1
schoolmaster	1
in	1
The	1
Vicar	1
of	1
Wakefield	1
I	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
florins	1
a	1
year	1
without	1
Greek	1
I	1
eat	1
heartily	1
without	1
Greek	1
But	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
length	1
overcame	1
his	1
dislike	1
of	1
learning	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
permitted	1
me	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
discovery	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
knowledge	1
It	1
gives	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
delight	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
left	1
my	1
father	1
brothers	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
Very	1
well	1
and	1
very	1
happy	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy	1
that	1
they	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
so	1
seldom	1
By	1
the	1
by	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
lecture	1
you	1
a	1
little	1
upon	1
their	1
account	1
myself	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
Frankenstein	1
continued	1
he	1
stopping	1
short	1
and	1
gazing	1
full	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
before	1
remark	1
how	1
very	1
ill	1
you	1
appear	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
pale	1
you	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
for	1
several	1
nights	1
You	1
have	1
guessed	1
right	1
I	1
have	1
lately	1
been	1
so	1
deeply	1
engaged	1
in	1
one	1
occupation	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
allowed	1
myself	1
sufficient	1
rest	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
employments	1
are	1
now	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
length	1
free	1
I	1
trembled	1
excessively	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
far	1
less	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
I	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
pace	1
and	1
we	1
soon	1
arrived	1
at	1
my	1
college	1
I	1
then	1
reflected	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
made	1
me	1
shiver	1
that	1
the	1
creature	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
in	1
my	1
apartment	1
might	1
still	1
be	1
there	1
alive	1
and	1
walking	1
about	1
I	1
dreaded	1
to	1
behold	1
this	1
monster	1
but	1
I	1
feared	1
still	1
more	1
that	1
Henry	1
should	1
see	1
him	1
Entreating	1
him	1
therefore	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
I	1
darted	1
up	1
towards	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
My	1
hand	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
before	1
I	1
recollected	1
myself	1
I	1
then	1
paused	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
shivering	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
I	1
threw	1
the	1
door	1
forcibly	1
open	1
as	1
children	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
expect	1
a	1
spectre	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
but	1
nothing	1
appeared	1
I	1
stepped	1
fearfully	1
in	1
the	1
apartment	1
was	1
empty	1
and	1
my	1
bedroom	1
was	1
also	1
freed	1
from	1
its	1
hideous	1
guest	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
good	1
fortune	1
could	1
have	1
befallen	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
became	1
assured	1
that	1
my	1
enemy	1
had	1
indeed	1
fled	1
I	1
clapped	1
my	1
hands	1
for	1
joy	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
to	1
Clerval	1
We	1
ascended	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
presently	1
brought	1
breakfast	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
contain	1
myself	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
joy	1
only	1
that	1
possessed	1
me	1
I	1
felt	1
my	1
flesh	1
tingle	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
sensitiveness	1
and	1
my	1
pulse	1
beat	1
rapidly	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
remain	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
I	1
jumped	1
over	1
the	1
chairs	1
clapped	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
Clerval	1
at	1
first	1
attributed	1
my	1
unusual	1
spirits	1
to	1
joy	1
on	1
his	1
arrival	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
observed	1
me	1
more	1
attentively	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
wildness	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
account	1
and	1
my	1
loud	1
unrestrained	1
heartless	1
laughter	1
frightened	1
and	1
astonished	1
him	1
My	1
dear	1
Victor	1
cried	1
he	1
what	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
Do	1
not	1
laugh	1
in	1
that	1
manner	1
How	1
ill	1
you	1
are	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
Do	1
not	1
ask	1
me	1
cried	1
I	1
putting	1
my	1
hands	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dreaded	1
spectre	1
glide	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
can	1
tell	1
Oh	1
save	1
me	1
Save	1
me	1
I	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
seized	1
me	1
I	1
struggled	1
furiously	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
Poor	1
Clerval	1
What	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
feelings	1
A	1
meeting	1
which	1
he	1
anticipated	1
with	1
such	1
joy	1
so	1
strangely	1
turned	1
to	1
bitterness	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
his	1
grief	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
lifeless	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
recover	1
my	1
senses	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
long	1
time	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
a	1
nervous	1
fever	1
which	1
confined	1
me	1
for	1
several	1
months	1
During	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
Henry	1
was	1
my	1
only	1
nurse	1
I	1
afterwards	1
learned	1
that	1
knowing	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
advanced	1
age	1
and	1
unfitness	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
journey	1
and	1
how	1
wretched	1
my	1
sickness	1
would	1
make	1
Elizabeth	1
he	1
spared	1
them	1
this	1
grief	1
by	1
concealing	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
my	1
disorder	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
kind	1
and	1
attentive	1
nurse	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
he	1
felt	1
of	1
my	1
recovery	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
harm	1
he	1
performed	1
the	1
kindest	1
action	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
towards	1
them	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
surely	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
unbounded	1
and	1
unremitting	1
attentions	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
could	1
have	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
The	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
bestowed	1
existence	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
I	1
raved	1
incessantly	1
concerning	1
him	1
Doubtless	1
my	1
words	1
surprised	1
Henry	1
he	1
at	1
first	1
believed	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wanderings	1
of	1
my	1
disturbed	1
imagination	1
but	1
the	1
pertinacity	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
continually	1
recurred	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
persuaded	1
him	1
that	1
my	1
disorder	1
indeed	1
owed	1
its	1
origin	1
to	1
some	1
uncommon	1
and	1
terrible	1
event	1
By	1
very	1
slow	1
degrees	1
and	1
with	1
frequent	1
relapses	1
that	1
alarmed	1
and	1
grieved	1
my	1
friend	1
I	1
recovered	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
became	1
capable	1
of	1
observing	1
outward	1
objects	1
with	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
pleasure	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
buds	1
were	1
shooting	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
shaded	1
my	1
window	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
divine	1
spring	1
and	1
the	1
season	1
contributed	1
greatly	1
to	1
my	1
convalescence	1
I	1
felt	1
also	1
sentiments	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
affection	1
revive	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
my	1
gloom	1
disappeared	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
cheerful	1
as	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
attacked	1
by	1
the	1
fatal	1
passion	1
Dearest	1
Clerval	1
exclaimed	1
I	1
how	1
kind	1
how	1
very	1
good	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
me	1
This	1
whole	1
winter	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
spent	1
in	1
study	1
as	1
you	1
promised	1
yourself	1
has	1
been	1
consumed	1
in	1
my	1
sick	1
room	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
ever	1
repay	1
you	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
greatest	1
remorse	1
for	1
the	1
disappointment	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
occasion	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
forgive	1
me	1
You	1
will	1
repay	1
me	1
entirely	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
discompose	1
yourself	1
but	1
get	1
well	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
appear	1
in	1
such	1
good	1
spirits	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
one	1
subject	1
may	1
I	1
not	1
I	1
trembled	1
One	1
subject	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
Could	1
he	1
allude	1
to	1
an	1
object	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
Compose	1
yourself	1
said	1
Clerval	1
who	1
observed	1
my	1
change	1
of	1
colour	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
mention	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
agitates	1
you	1
but	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
cousin	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
if	1
they	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
handwriting	1
They	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
ill	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
are	1
uneasy	1
at	1
your	1
long	1
silence	1
Is	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
dear	1
Henry	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
my	1
first	1
thought	1
would	1
not	1
fly	1
towards	1
those	1
dear	1
dear	1
friends	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
deserving	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
If	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
present	1
temper	1
my	1
friend	1
you	1
will	1
perhaps	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
letter	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
lying	1
here	1
some	1
days	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
your	1
cousin	1
I	1
believe	1
Chapter	1

Clerval	1
then	1
put	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
Elizabeth	1
My	1
dearest	1
Cousin	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
ill	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
constant	1
letters	1
of	1
dear	1
kind	1
Henry	1
are	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
reassure	1
me	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
You	1
are	1
forbidden	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
pen	1
yet	1
one	1
word	1
from	1
you	1
dear	1
Victor	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
calm	1
our	1
apprehensions	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
each	1
post	1
would	1
bring	1
this	1
line	1
and	1
my	1
persuasions	1
have	1
restrained	1
my	1
uncle	1
from	1
undertaking	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
Ingolstadt	1
I	1
have	1
prevented	1
his	1
encountering	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
and	1
perhaps	1
dangers	1
of	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
journey	1
yet	1
how	1
often	1
have	1
I	1
regretted	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
perform	1
it	1
myself	1
I	1
figure	1
to	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
attending	1
on	1
your	1
sickbed	1
has	1
devolved	1
on	1
some	1
mercenary	1
old	1
nurse	1
who	1
could	1
never	1
guess	1
your	1
wishes	1
nor	1
minister	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
affection	1
of	1
your	1
poor	1
cousin	1
Yet	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
now	1
Clerval	1
writes	1
that	1
indeed	1
you	1
are	1
getting	1
better	1
I	1
eagerly	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
confirm	1
this	1
intelligence	1
soon	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
handwriting	1
Get	1
well	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
us	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
happy	1
cheerful	1
home	1
and	1
friends	1
who	1
love	1
you	1
dearly	1
Your	1
father	1
s	1
health	1
is	1
vigorous	1
and	1
he	1
asks	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
care	1
will	1
ever	1
cloud	1
his	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
How	1
pleased	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
remark	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
our	1
Ernest	1
He	1
is	1
now	1
sixteen	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
activity	1
and	1
spirit	1
He	1
is	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
Swiss	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
foreign	1
service	1
but	1
we	1
cannot	1
part	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
least	1
until	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
returns	1
to	1
us	1
My	1
uncle	1
is	1
not	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
career	1
in	1
a	1
distant	1
country	1
but	1
Ernest	1
never	1
had	1
your	1
powers	1
of	1
application	1
He	1
looks	1
upon	1
study	1
as	1
an	1
odious	1
fetter	1
his	1
time	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
climbing	1
the	1
hills	1
or	1
rowing	1
on	1
the	1
lake	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
become	1
an	1
idler	1
unless	1
we	1
yield	1
the	1
point	1
and	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
the	1
profession	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
selected	1
Little	1
alteration	1
except	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
children	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
since	1
you	1
left	1
us	1
The	1
blue	1
lake	1
and	1
snow	1
clad	1
mountains	1
they	1
never	1
change	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
our	1
placid	1
home	1
and	1
our	1
contented	1
hearts	1
are	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
immutable	1
laws	1
My	1
trifling	1
occupations	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
time	1
and	1
amuse	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
rewarded	1
for	1
any	1
exertions	1
by	1
seeing	1
none	1
but	1
happy	1
kind	1
faces	1
around	1
me	1
Since	1
you	1
left	1
us	1
but	1
one	1
change	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
household	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
on	1
what	1
occasion	1
Justine	1
Moritz	1
entered	1
our	1
family	1
Probably	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
will	1
relate	1
her	1
history	1
therefore	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
Madame	1
Moritz	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
with	1
four	1
children	1
of	1
whom	1
Justine	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
This	1
girl	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
but	1
through	1
a	1
strange	1
perversity	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
her	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
M	1
Moritz	1
treated	1
her	1
very	1
ill	1
My	1
aunt	1
observed	1
this	1
and	1
when	1
Justine	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
prevailed	1
on	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
allow	1
her	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
our	1
house	1
The	1
republican	1
institutions	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
have	1
produced	1
simpler	1
and	1
happier	1
manners	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
monarchies	1
that	1
surround	1
it	1
Hence	1
there	1
is	1
less	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
several	1
classes	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
the	1
lower	1
orders	1
being	1
neither	1
so	1
poor	1
nor	1
so	1
despised	1
their	1
manners	1
are	1
more	1
refined	1
and	1
moral	1
A	1
servant	1
in	1
Geneva	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
servant	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
England	1
Justine	1
thus	1
received	1
in	1
our	1
family	1
learned	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
servant	1
a	1
condition	1
which	1
in	1
our	1
fortunate	1
country	1
does	1
not	1
include	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
ignorance	1
and	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
Justine	1
you	1
may	1
remember	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
of	1
yours	1
and	1
I	1
recollect	1
you	1
once	1
remarked	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
ill	1
humour	1
one	1
glance	1
from	1
Justine	1
could	1
dissipate	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
that	1
Ariosto	1
gives	1
concerning	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Angelica	1
she	1
looked	1
so	1
frank	1
hearted	1
and	1
happy	1
My	1
aunt	1
conceived	1
a	1
great	1
attachment	1
for	1
her	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
induced	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
an	1
education	1
superior	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
intended	1
This	1
benefit	1
was	1
fully	1
repaid	1
Justine	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
grateful	1
little	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
any	1
professions	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
one	1
pass	1
her	1
lips	1
but	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
she	1
almost	1
adored	1
her	1
protectress	1
Although	1
her	1
disposition	1
was	1
gay	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
respects	1
inconsiderate	1
yet	1
she	1
paid	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
to	1
every	1
gesture	1
of	1
my	1
aunt	1
She	1
thought	1
her	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
all	1
excellence	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
imitate	1
her	1
phraseology	1
and	1
manners	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
she	1
often	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
When	1
my	1
dearest	1
aunt	1
died	1
every	1
one	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
occupied	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
grief	1
to	1
notice	1
poor	1
Justine	1
who	1
had	1
attended	1
her	1
during	1
her	1
illness	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
anxious	1
affection	1
Poor	1
Justine	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1
but	1
other	1
trials	1
were	1
reserved	1
for	1
her	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
her	1
brothers	1
and	1
sister	1
died	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
her	1
neglected	1
daughter	1
was	1
left	1
childless	1
The	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
troubled	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
her	1
favourites	1
was	1
a	1
judgement	1
from	1
heaven	1
to	1
chastise	1
her	1
partiality	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
her	1
confessor	1
confirmed	1
the	1
idea	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
conceived	1
Accordingly	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
after	1
your	1
departure	1
for	1
Ingolstadt	1
Justine	1
was	1
called	1
home	1
by	1
her	1
repentant	1
mother	1
Poor	1
girl	1
She	1
wept	1
when	1
she	1
quitted	1
our	1
house	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
altered	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
aunt	1
grief	1
had	1
given	1
softness	1
and	1
a	1
winning	1
mildness	1
to	1
her	1
manners	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
remarkable	1
for	1
vivacity	1
Nor	1
was	1
her	1
residence	1
at	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
to	1
restore	1
her	1
gaiety	1
The	1
poor	1
woman	1
was	1
very	1
vacillating	1
in	1
her	1
repentance	1
She	1
sometimes	1
begged	1
Justine	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
unkindness	1
but	1
much	1
oftener	1
accused	1
her	1
of	1
having	1
caused	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
her	1
brothers	1
and	1
sister	1
Perpetual	1
fretting	1
at	1
length	1
threw	1
Madame	1
Moritz	1
into	1
a	1
decline	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
increased	1
her	1
irritability	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
at	1
peace	1
for	1
ever	1
She	1
died	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
approach	1
of	1
cold	1
weather	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
this	1
last	1
winter	1
Justine	1
has	1
just	1
returned	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
love	1
her	1
tenderly	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
clever	1
and	1
gentle	1
and	1
extremely	1
pretty	1
as	1
I	1
mentioned	1
before	1
her	1
mien	1
and	1
her	1
expression	1
continually	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
also	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
of	1
little	1
darling	1
William	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
tall	1
of	1
his	1
age	1
with	1
sweet	1
laughing	1
blue	1
eyes	1
dark	1
eyelashes	1
and	1
curling	1
hair	1
When	1
he	1
smiles	1
two	1
little	1
dimples	1
appear	1
on	1
each	1
cheek	1
which	1
are	1
rosy	1
with	1
health	1
He	1
has	1
already	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
little	1
wives	1
	1
but	1
Louisa	1
Biron	1
is	1
his	1
favourite	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
girl	1
of	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
Now	1
dear	1
Victor	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
indulged	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
gossip	1
concerning	1
the	1
good	1
people	1
of	1
Geneva	1
The	1
pretty	1
Miss	1
Mansfield	1
has	1
already	1
received	1
the	1
congratulatory	1
visits	1
on	1
her	1
approaching	1
marriage	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
Englishman	1
John	1
Melbourne	1
Esq	1
Her	1
ugly	1
sister	1
Manon	1
married	1
M	1
Duvillard	1
the	1
rich	1
banker	1
last	1
autumn	1
Your	1
favourite	1
schoolfellow	1
Louis	1
Manoir	1
has	1
suffered	1
several	1
misfortunes	1
since	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
Clerval	1
from	1
Geneva	1
But	1
he	1

to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
marrying	1
a	1
lively	1
pretty	1
Frenchwoman	1
Madame	1
Tavernier	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
widow	1
and	1
much	1
older	1

Manoir	1

she	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
admired	1
and	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
everybody	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
myself	1
into	1
better	1
spirits	1
dear	1
cousin	1

my	1
anxiety	1
returns	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
conclude	1
Write	1
dearest	1
Victor	1
one	1
line	1
one	1
word	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
blessing	1

us	1
Ten	1

thanks	1
to	1
Henry	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
his	1

his	1

we	1
are	1
sincerely	1

Adieu	1
my	1

you	1
write	1

Dear	1
dear	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
read	1
her	1
letter	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
instantly	1
and	1
relieve	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
anxiety	1
they	1
must	1
feel	1
I	1
wrote	1
and	1
this	1
exertion	1
greatly	1
fatigued	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
convalescence	1
had	1
commenced	1
and	1
proceeded	1
regularly	1
In	1
another	1
fortnight	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
chamber	1
One	1
of	1
my	1
first	1
duties	1
on	1
my	1
recovery	1
was	1
to	1
introduce	1
Clerval	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
professors	1
of	1
the	1
university	1
In	1
doing	1
this	1
I	1
underwent	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
rough	1
usage	1
ill	1
befitting	1
the	1
wounds	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
had	1
sustained	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
fatal	1
night	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
labours	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
I	1
had	1
conceived	1
a	1
violent	1
antipathy	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
otherwise	1
quite	1
restored	1
to	1
health	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
chemical	1
instrument	1
would	1
renew	1
all	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
my	1
nervous	1
symptoms	1
Henry	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
had	1
removed	1
all	1
my	1
apparatus	1
from	1
my	1
view	1
He	1
had	1
also	1
changed	1
my	1
apartment	1
for	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
acquired	1
a	1
dislike	1
for	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
my	1
laboratory	1
But	1
these	1
cares	1
of	1
Clerval	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
no	1
avail	1
when	1
I	1
visited	1
the	1
professors	1
M	1
Waldman	1
inflicted	1
torture	1
when	1
he	1
praised	1
with	1
kindness	1
and	1
warmth	1
the	1
astonishing	1
progress	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
sciences	1
He	1
soon	1
perceived	1
that	1
I	1
disliked	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
not	1
guessing	1
the	1
real	1
cause	1
he	1
attributed	1
my	1
feelings	1
to	1
modesty	1
and	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
from	1
my	1
improvement	1
to	1
the	1
science	1
itself	1
with	1
a	1
desire	1
as	1
I	1
evidently	1
saw	1
of	1
drawing	1
me	1
out	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
He	1
meant	1
to	1
please	1
and	1
he	1
tormented	1
me	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
carefully	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
in	1
my	1
view	1
those	1
instruments	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
afterwards	1
used	1
in	1
putting	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
cruel	1
death	1
I	1
writhed	1
under	1
his	1
words	1
yet	1
dared	1
not	1
exhibit	1
the	1
pain	1
I	1
felt	1
Clerval	1
whose	1
eyes	1
and	1
feelings	1
were	1
always	1
quick	1
in	1
discerning	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
others	1
declined	1
the	1
subject	1
alleging	1
in	1
excuse	1
his	1
total	1
ignorance	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
took	1
a	1
more	1
general	1
turn	1
I	1
thanked	1
my	1
friend	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
I	1
saw	1
plainly	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
attempted	1
to	1
draw	1
my	1
secret	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
although	1
I	1
loved	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
reverence	1
that	1
knew	1
no	1
bounds	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
persuade	1
myself	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
event	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
often	1
present	1
to	1
my	1
recollection	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
feared	1
the	1
detail	1
to	1
another	1
would	1
only	1
impress	1
more	1
deeply	1
M	1
Krempe	1
was	1
not	1
equally	1
docile	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
condition	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
almost	1
insupportable	1
sensitiveness	1
his	1
harsh	1
blunt	1
encomiums	1
gave	1
me	1
even	1
more	1
pain	1
than	1
the	1
benevolent	1
approbation	1
of	1
M	1
Waldman	1
D	1
n	1
the	1
fellow	1
cried	1
he	1
why	1
M	1
Clerval	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
he	1
has	1
outstript	1
us	1
all	1
Ay	1
stare	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
nevertheless	1
true	1
A	1
youngster	1
who	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
believed	1
in	1
Cornelius	1
Agrippa	1
as	1
firmly	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
has	1
now	1
set	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
soon	1
pulled	1
down	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
Ay	1
ay	1
continued	1
he	1
observing	1
my	1
face	1
expressive	1
of	1
suffering	1
M	1
Frankenstein	1
is	1
modest	1
an	1
excellent	1
quality	1
in	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
Young	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
diffident	1
of	1
themselves	1
you	1
know	1
M	1
Clerval	1
I	1
was	1
myself	1
when	1
young	1
but	1
that	1
wears	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
M	1
Krempe	1
had	1
now	1
commenced	1
an	1
eulogy	1
on	1
himself	1
which	1
happily	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
from	1
a	1
subject	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
annoying	1
to	1
me	1
Clerval	1
had	1
never	1
sympathised	1
in	1
my	1
tastes	1
for	1
natural	1
science	1
and	1
his	1
literary	1
pursuits	1
differed	1
wholly	1
from	1
those	1
which	1
had	1
occupied	1
me	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
university	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
making	1
himself	1
complete	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
oriental	1
languages	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
should	1
open	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
himself	1
Resolved	1
to	1
pursue	1
no	1
inglorious	1
career	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
toward	1
the	1
East	1
as	1
affording	1
scope	1
for	1
his	1
spirit	1
of	1
enterprise	1
The	1
Persian	1
Arabic	1
and	1
Sanskrit	1
languages	1
engaged	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
easily	1
induced	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
studies	1
Idleness	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
reflection	1
and	1
hated	1
my	1
former	1
studies	1
I	1
felt	1
great	1
relief	1
in	1
being	1
the	1
fellow	1
pupil	1
with	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
found	1
not	1
only	1
instruction	1
but	1
consolation	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
orientalists	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
him	1
attempt	1
a	1
critical	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
dialects	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
contemplate	1
making	1
any	1
other	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
temporary	1
amusement	1
I	1
read	1
merely	1
to	1
understand	1
their	1
meaning	1
and	1
they	1
well	1
repaid	1
my	1
labours	1
Their	1
melancholy	1
is	1
soothing	1
and	1
their	1
joy	1
elevating	1
to	1
a	1
degree	1
I	1
never	1
experienced	1
in	1
studying	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
country	1
When	1
you	1
read	1
their	1
writings	1
life	1
appears	1
to	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
warm	1
sun	1
and	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
roses	1
in	1
the	1
smiles	1
and	1
frowns	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
enemy	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
consumes	1
your	1
own	1
heart	1
How	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
manly	1
and	1
heroical	1
poetry	1
of	1
Greece	1
and	1
Rome	1
Summer	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
these	1
occupations	1
and	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
Geneva	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
autumn	1
but	1
being	1
delayed	1
by	1
several	1
accidents	1
winter	1
and	1
snow	1
arrived	1
the	1
roads	1
were	1
deemed	1
impassable	1
and	1
my	1
journey	1
was	1
retarded	1
until	1
the	1
ensuing	1
spring	1
I	1
felt	1
this	1
delay	1
very	1
bitterly	1
for	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
and	1
my	1
beloved	1
friends	1
My	1
return	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
delayed	1
so	1
long	1
from	1
an	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
leave	1
Clerval	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
place	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
The	1
winter	1
however	1
was	1
spent	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
spring	1
was	1
uncommonly	1
late	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
its	1
beauty	1
compensated	1
for	1
its	1
dilatoriness	1
The	1
month	1
of	1
May	1
had	1
already	1
commenced	1
and	1
I	1
expected	1
the	1
letter	1
daily	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
when	1
Henry	1
proposed	1
a	1
pedestrian	1
tour	1
in	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
Ingolstadt	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
bid	1
a	1
personal	1
farewell	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
inhabited	1
I	1
acceded	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
this	1
proposition	1
I	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
exercise	1
and	1
Clerval	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
my	1
favourite	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
ramble	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
among	1
the	1
scenes	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
We	1
passed	1
a	1
fortnight	1
in	1
these	1
perambulations	1
my	1
health	1
and	1
spirits	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
restored	1
and	1
they	1
gained	1
additional	1
strength	1
from	1
the	1
salubrious	1
air	1
I	1
breathed	1
the	1
natural	1
incidents	1
of	1
our	1
progress	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
Study	1
had	1
before	1
secluded	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
intercourse	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
and	1
rendered	1
me	1
unsocial	1
but	1
Clerval	1
called	1
forth	1
the	1
better	1
feelings	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
he	1
again	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
cheerful	1
faces	1
of	1
children	1
Excellent	1
friend	1
how	1
sincerely	1
you	1
did	1
love	1
me	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
elevate	1
my	1
mind	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
A	1
selfish	1
pursuit	1
had	1
cramped	1
and	1
narrowed	1
me	1
until	1
your	1
gentleness	1
and	1
affection	1
warmed	1
and	1
opened	1
my	1
senses	1
I	1
became	1
the	1
same	1
happy	1
creature	1
who	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
loved	1
and	1
beloved	1
by	1
all	1
had	1
no	1
sorrow	1
or	1
care	1
When	1
happy	1
inanimate	1
nature	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
bestowing	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
sensations	1
A	1
serene	1
sky	1
and	1
verdant	1
fields	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
ecstasy	1
The	1
present	1
season	1
was	1
indeed	1
divine	1
the	1
flowers	1
of	1
spring	1
bloomed	1
in	1
the	1
hedges	1
while	1
those	1
of	1
summer	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
bud	1
I	1
was	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
thoughts	1
which	1
during	1
the	1
preceding	1
year	1
had	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
notwithstanding	1
my	1
endeavours	1
to	1
throw	1
them	1
off	1
with	1
an	1
invincible	1
burden	1
Henry	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
my	1
gaiety	1
and	1
sincerely	1
sympathised	1
in	1
my	1
feelings	1
he	1
exerted	1
himself	1
to	1
amuse	1
me	1
while	1
he	1
expressed	1
the	1
sensations	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
soul	1
The	1
resources	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
were	1
truly	1
astonishing	1
his	1
conversation	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
imagination	1
and	1
very	1
often	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
Persian	1
and	1
Arabic	1
writers	1
he	1
invented	1
tales	1
of	1
wonderful	1
fancy	1
and	1
passion	1
At	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
repeated	1
my	1
favourite	1
poems	1
or	1
drew	1
me	1
out	1
into	1
arguments	1
which	1
he	1
supported	1
with	1
great	1
ingenuity	1
We	1
returned	1
to	1
our	1
college	1
on	1
a	1
Sunday	1
afternoon	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
dancing	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
we	1
met	1
appeared	1
gay	1
and	1
happy	1
My	1
own	1
spirits	1
were	1
high	1
and	1
I	1
bounded	1
along	1
with	1
feelings	1
of	1
unbridled	1
joy	1
and	1
hilarity	1
Chapter	1
7	1
On	1
my	1
return	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
My	1
dear	1
Victor	1
You	1
have	1
probably	1
waited	1
impatiently	1
for	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
your	1
return	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
tempted	1
to	1
write	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
merely	1
mentioning	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
expect	1
you	1
But	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
cruel	1
kindness	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
What	1
would	1
be	1
your	1
surprise	1
my	1
son	1
when	1
you	1
expected	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
glad	1
welcome	1
to	1
behold	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
tears	1
and	1
wretchedness	1
And	1
how	1
Victor	1
can	1
I	1
relate	1
our	1
misfortune	1
Absence	1
cannot	1
have	1
rendered	1
you	1
callous	1
to	1
our	1
joys	1
and	1
griefs	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
inflict	1
pain	1
on	1
my	1
long	1
absent	1
son	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
prepare	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
woeful	1
news	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
even	1
now	1
your	1
eye	1
skims	1
over	1

tidings	1
William	1
is	1
dead	1
that	1
sweet	1
child	1
whose	1

Victor	1
he	1
is	1
murdered	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
console	1
you	1
but	1
will	1
simply	1
relate	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
transaction	1
Last	1
Thursday	1
May	1
7th	1
I	1
my	1
niece	1
and	1
your	1
two	1
brothers	1
went	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
Plainpalais	1
The	1
evening	1
was	1
warm	1
and	1
serene	1
and	1
we	1
prolonged	1
our	1
walk	1
farther	1
than	1
usual	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
dusk	1
before	1
we	1
thought	1
of	1
returning	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
discovered	1
that	1
William	1
and	1
Ernest	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
before	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
We	1
accordingly	1
rested	1
on	1
a	1
seat	1
until	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
Presently	1
Ernest	1
came	1
and	1
enquired	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
William	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
to	1
hide	1
himself	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
vainly	1
sought	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
afterwards	1
waited	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
This	1
account	1
rather	1
alarmed	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
continued	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
him	1
until	1
night	1
fell	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
conjectured	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
We	1
returned	1
again	1
with	1
torches	1
for	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
rest	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
sweet	1
boy	1
had	1
lost	1
himself	1
and	1
was	1
exposed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
damps	1
and	1
dews	1
of	1
night	1
Elizabeth	1
also	1
suffered	1
extreme	1
anguish	1
About	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
discovered	1
my	1
lovely	1
boy	1
whom	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
blooming	1
and	1
active	1
in	1
health	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
livid	1
and	1
motionless	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
s	1
finger	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
He	1
was	1
conveyed	1
home	1
and	1
the	1
anguish	1
that	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
my	1
countenance	1
betrayed	1
the	1
secret	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
earnest	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
corpse	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
attempted	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
persisted	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
it	1
lay	1
hastily	1
examined	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
victim	1
and	1
clasping	1
her	1
hands	1
exclaimed	1
O	1
God	1
I	1
have	1
murdered	1
my	1
darling	1
child	1
She	1
fainted	1
and	1
was	1
restored	1
with	1
extreme	1
difficulty	1
When	1
she	1
again	1
lived	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
weep	1
and	1
sigh	1
She	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
William	1
had	1
teased	1
her	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
wear	1
a	1
very	1
valuable	1
miniature	1
that	1
she	1
possessed	1
of	1
your	1
mother	1
This	1
picture	1
is	1
gone	1
and	1
was	1
doubtless	1
the	1
temptation	1
which	1
urged	1
the	1
murderer	1
to	1
the	1
deed	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
present	1
although	1
our	1
exertions	1
to	1
discover	1
him	1
are	1
unremitted	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
restore	1
my	1
beloved	1
William	1
Come	1
dearest	1
Victor	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
console	1
Elizabeth	1
She	1
weeps	1
continually	1
and	1
accuses	1
herself	1
unjustly	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
her	1
words	1
pierce	1
my	1
heart	1
We	1
are	1
all	1
unhappy	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
that	1
be	1
an	1
additional	1
motive	1
for	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
comforter	1
Your	1
dear	1
mother	1
Alas	1
Victor	1
I	1
now	1
say	1
Thank	1
God	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
cruel	1
miserable	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
youngest	1
darling	1
Come	1
Victor	1
not	1
brooding	1
thoughts	1
of	1
vengeance	1
against	1
the	1
assassin	1
but	1
with	1
feelings	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
gentleness	1
that	1
will	1
heal	1
instead	1
of	1
festering	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
our	1
minds	1
Enter	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning	1
my	1
friend	1
but	1
with	1
kindness	1
and	1
affection	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
hatred	1
for	1
your	1
enemies	1
Your	1
affectionate	1
and	1
afflicted	1
father	1

May	1
12th	1
17	1
Clerval	1
who	1
had	1
watched	1
my	1
countenance	1
as	1
I	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
despair	1
that	1
succeeded	1
the	1
joy	1
I	1
at	1
first	1
expressed	1
on	1
receiving	1
new	1
from	1
my	1
friends	1
I	1
threw	1
the	1
letter	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
covered	1
my	1
face	1
with	1
my	1
hands	1
My	1
dear	1
Frankenstein	1
exclaimed	1
Henry	1
when	1
he	1
perceived	1
me	1
weep	1
with	1
bitterness	1
are	1
you	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy	1
My	1
dear	1
friend	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
I	1
motioned	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
while	1
I	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
extremest	1
agitation	1
Tears	1
also	1
gushed	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Clerval	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune	1
I	1
can	1
offer	1
you	1
no	1
consolation	1
my	1
friend	1
said	1
he	1
your	1
disaster	1
is	1
irreparable	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
To	1
go	1
instantly	1
to	1
Geneva	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
Henry	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
horses	1
During	1
our	1
walk	1
Clerval	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
of	1
consolation	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
express	1
his	1
heartfelt	1
sympathy	1
Poor	1
William	1
said	1
he	1
dear	1
lovely	1
child	1
he	1
now	1
sleeps	1
with	1
his	1
angel	1
mother	1
Who	1
that	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
bright	1
and	1
joyous	1
in	1
his	1
young	1
beauty	1
but	1
must	1
weep	1
over	1
his	1
untimely	1
loss	1
To	1
die	1
so	1
miserably	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
murderer	1
s	1
grasp	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
a	1
murdered	1
that	1
could	1
destroy	1
radiant	1
innocence	1
Poor	1
little	1
fellow	1
one	1
only	1
consolation	1
have	1
we	1
his	1
friends	1
mourn	1
and	1
weep	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
rest	1
The	1
pang	1
is	1
over	1
his	1
sufferings	1
are	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
for	1
ever	1
A	1
sod	1
covers	1
his	1
gentle	1
form	1
and	1
he	1
knows	1
no	1
pain	1
He	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
pity	1
we	1
must	1
reserve	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
miserable	1
survivors	1
Clerval	1
spoke	1
thus	1
as	1
we	1
hurried	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
the	1
words	1
impressed	1
themselves	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
I	1
remembered	1
them	1
afterwards	1
in	1
solitude	1
But	1
now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
horses	1
arrived	1
I	1
hurried	1
into	1
a	1
cabriolet	1
and	1
bade	1
farewell	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
My	1
journey	1
was	1
very	1
melancholy	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
hurry	1
on	1
for	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
console	1
and	1
sympathise	1
with	1
my	1
loved	1
and	1
sorrowing	1
friends	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
drew	1
near	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
I	1
slackened	1
my	1
progress	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
sustain	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
feelings	1
that	1
crowded	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
I	1
passed	1
through	1
scenes	1
familiar	1
to	1
my	1
youth	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
nearly	1
six	1
years	1
How	1
altered	1
every	1
thing	1
might	1
be	1
during	1
that	1
time	1
One	1
sudden	1
and	1
desolating	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
but	1
a	1
thousand	1
little	1
circumstances	1
might	1
have	1
by	1
degrees	1
worked	1
other	1
alterations	1
which	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
done	1
more	1
tranquilly	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
decisive	1
Fear	1
overcame	1
me	1
I	1
dared	1
no	1
advance	1
dreading	1
a	1
thousand	1
nameless	1
evils	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
tremble	1
although	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
define	1
them	1
I	1
remained	1
two	1
days	1
at	1
Lausanne	1
in	1
this	1
painful	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
I	1
contemplated	1
the	1
lake	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
placid	1
all	1
around	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
the	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
nature	1
were	1
not	1
changed	1
By	1
degrees	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
heavenly	1
scene	1
restored	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
continued	1
my	1
journey	1
towards	1
Geneva	1
The	1
road	1
ran	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
became	1
narrower	1
as	1
I	1
approached	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
I	1
discovered	1
more	1
distinctly	1
the	1
black	1
sides	1
of	1
Jura	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
summit	1
of	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
I	1
wept	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
Dear	1
mountains	1
my	1
own	1
beautiful	1
lake	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
welcome	1
your	1
wanderer	1
Your	1
summits	1
are	1
clear	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
lake	1
are	1
blue	1
and	1
placid	1
Is	1
this	1
to	1
prognosticate	1
peace	1
or	1
to	1
mock	1
at	1
my	1
unhappiness	1
I	1
fear	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
render	1
myself	1
tedious	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
these	1
preliminary	1
circumstances	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
days	1
of	1
comparative	1
happiness	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
pleasure	1
My	1
country	1
my	1
beloved	1
country	1
who	1
but	1
a	1
native	1
can	1
tell	1
the	1
delight	1
I	1
took	1
in	1
again	1
beholding	1
thy	1
streams	1
thy	1
mountains	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
thy	1
lovely	1
lake	1
Yet	1
as	1
I	1
drew	1
nearer	1
home	1
grief	1
and	1
fear	1
again	1
overcame	1
me	1
Night	1
also	1
closed	1
around	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
see	1
the	1
dark	1
mountains	1
I	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
gloomily	1
The	1
picture	1
appeared	1
a	1
vast	1
and	1
dim	1
scene	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
I	1
foresaw	1
obscurely	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
most	1
wretched	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
Alas	1
I	1
prophesied	1
truly	1
and	1
failed	1
only	1
in	1
one	1
single	1
circumstance	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
I	1
imagined	1
and	1
dreaded	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
conceive	1
the	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
anguish	1
I	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
endure	1
It	1
was	1
completely	1
dark	1
when	1
I	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
Geneva	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
were	1
already	1
shut	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
Secheron	1
a	1
village	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
The	1
sky	1
was	1
serene	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
rest	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
my	1
poor	1
William	1
had	1
been	1
murdered	1
As	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
lake	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
Plainpalais	1
During	1
this	1
short	1
voyage	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
lightning	1
playing	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
figures	1
The	1
storm	1
appeared	1
to	1
approach	1
rapidly	1
and	1
on	1
landing	1
I	1
ascended	1
a	1
low	1
hill	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
observe	1
its	1
progress	1
It	1
advanced	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
clouded	1
and	1
I	1
soon	1
felt	1
the	1
rain	1
coming	1
slowly	1
in	1
large	1
drops	1
but	1
its	1
violence	1
quickly	1
increased	1
I	1
quitted	1
my	1
seat	1
and	1
walked	1
on	1
although	1
the	1
darkness	1
and	1
storm	1
increased	1
every	1
minute	1
and	1
the	1
thunder	1
burst	1
with	1
a	1
terrific	1
crash	1
over	1
my	1
head	1
It	1
was	1
echoed	1
from	1
Sal^eve	1
the	1
Juras	1
and	1
the	1
Alps	1
of	1
Savoy	1
vivid	1
flashes	1
of	1
lightning	1
dazzled	1
my	1
eyes	1
illuminating	1
the	1
lake	1
making	1
it	1
appear	1
like	1
a	1
vast	1
sheet	1
of	1
fire	1
then	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
every	1
thing	1
seemed	1
of	1
a	1
pitchy	1
darkness	1
until	1
the	1
eye	1
recovered	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
preceding	1
flash	1
The	1
storm	1
as	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
Switzerland	1
appeared	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
The	1
most	1
violent	1
storm	1
hung	1
exactly	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
over	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
lies	1
between	1
the	1
promontory	1
of	1
Belrive	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Cop^et	1
Another	1
storm	1
enlightened	1
Jura	1
with	1
faint	1
flashes	1
and	1
another	1
darkened	1
and	1
sometimes	1
disclosed	1
the	1
M^ole	1
a	1
peaked	1
mountain	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
While	1
I	1
watched	1
the	1
tempest	1
so	1
beautiful	1
yet	1
terrific	1
I	1
wandered	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
hasty	1
step	1
This	1
noble	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
elevated	1
my	1
spirits	1
I	1
clasped	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
aloud	1
William	1
dear	1
angel	1
this	1
is	1
thy	1
funeral	1
this	1
thy	1
dirge	1
As	1
I	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
perceived	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
a	1
figure	1
which	1
stole	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
trees	1
near	1
me	1
I	1
stood	1
fixed	1
gazing	1
intently	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
A	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
illuminated	1
the	1
object	1
and	1
discovered	1
its	1
shape	1
plainly	1
to	1
me	1
its	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
and	1
the	1
deformity	1
of	1
its	1
aspect	1
more	1
hideous	1
than	1
belongs	1
to	1
humanity	1
instantly	1
informed	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wretch	1
the	1
filthy	1
daemon	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
life	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
there	1
Could	1
he	1
be	1
I	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
conception	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
No	1
sooner	1
did	1
that	1
idea	1
cross	1
my	1
imagination	1
than	1
I	1
became	1
convinced	1
of	1
its	1
truth	1
my	1
teeth	1
chattered	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
lean	1
against	1
a	1
tree	1
for	1
support	1
The	1
figure	1
passed	1
me	1
quickly	1
and	1
I	1
lost	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
Nothing	1
in	1
human	1
shape	1
could	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
fair	1
child	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
murderer	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
doubt	1
it	1
The	1
mere	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
idea	1
was	1
an	1
irresistible	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
pursuing	1
the	1
devil	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
another	1
flash	1
discovered	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
hanging	1
among	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
nearly	1
perpendicular	1
ascent	1
of	1
Mont	1
Sal^eve	1
a	1
hill	1
that	1
bounds	1
Plainpalais	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
He	1
soon	1
reached	1
the	1
summit	1
and	1
disappeared	1
I	1
remained	1
motionless	1
The	1
thunder	1
ceased	1
but	1
the	1
rain	1
still	1
continued	1
and	1
the	1
scene	1
was	1
enveloped	1
in	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
darkness	1
I	1
revolved	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
until	1
now	1
sought	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
whole	1
train	1
of	1
my	1
progress	1
toward	1
the	1
creation	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
hands	1
at	1
my	1
bedside	1
its	1
departure	1
Two	1
years	1
had	1
now	1
nearly	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
first	1
received	1
life	1
and	1
was	1
this	1
his	1
first	1
crime	1
Alas	1
I	1
had	1
turned	1
loose	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
depraved	1
wretch	1
whose	1
delight	1
was	1
in	1
carnage	1
and	1
misery	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
murdered	1
my	1
brother	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
conceive	1
the	1
anguish	1
I	1
suffered	1
during	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
which	1
I	1
spent	1
cold	1
and	1
wet	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
my	1
imagination	1
was	1
busy	1
in	1
scenes	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
despair	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
being	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
cast	1
among	1
mankind	1
and	1
endowed	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
power	1
to	1
effect	1
purposes	1
of	1
horror	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
deed	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
done	1
nearly	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
vampire	1
my	1
own	1
spirit	1
let	1
loose	1
from	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
Day	1
dawned	1
and	1
I	1
directed	1
my	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
town	1
The	1
gates	1
were	1
open	1
and	1
I	1
hastened	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
house	1
My	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
I	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
murderer	1
and	1
cause	1
instant	1
pursuit	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
But	1
I	1
paused	1
when	1
I	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
story	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
A	1
being	1
whom	1
I	1
myself	1
had	1
formed	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
life	1
had	1
met	1
me	1
at	1
midnight	1
among	1
the	1
precipices	1
of	1
an	1
inaccessible	1
mountain	1
I	1
remembered	1
also	1
the	1
nervous	1
fever	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
seized	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
dated	1
my	1
creation	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
give	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
delirium	1
to	1
a	1
tale	1
otherwise	1
so	1
utterly	1
improbable	1
I	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
had	1
communicated	1
such	1
a	1
relation	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
ravings	1
of	1
insanity	1
Besides	1
the	1
strange	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
would	1
elude	1
all	1
pursuit	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
credited	1
as	1
to	1
persuade	1
my	1
relatives	1
to	1
commence	1
it	1
And	1
then	1
of	1
what	1
use	1
would	1
be	1
pursuit	1
Who	1
could	1
arrest	1
a	1
creature	1
capable	1
of	1
scaling	1
the	1
overhanging	1
sides	1
of	1
Mont	1
Sal^eve	1
These	1
reflections	1
determined	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
remain	1
silent	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
I	1
entered	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
house	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
servants	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
library	1
to	1
attend	1
their	1
usual	1
hour	1
of	1
rising	1
Six	1
years	1
had	1
elapsed	1
passed	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
indelible	1
trace	1
and	1
I	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
last	1
embraced	1
my	1
father	1
before	1
my	1
departure	1
for	1
Ingolstadt	1
Beloved	1
and	1
venerable	1
parent	1
He	1
still	1
remained	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
gazed	1
on	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
which	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
mantel	1
piece	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
historical	1
subject	1
painted	1
at	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
desire	1
and	1
represented	1
Caroline	1
Beaufort	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
despair	1
kneeling	1
by	1
the	1
coffin	1
of	1
her	1
dead	1
father	1
Her	1
garb	1
was	1
rustic	1
and	1
her	1
cheek	1
pale	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
beauty	1
that	1
hardly	1
permitted	1
the	1
sentiment	1
of	1
pity	1
Below	1
this	1
picture	1
was	1
a	1
miniature	1
of	1
William	1
and	1
my	1
tears	1
flowed	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
thus	1
engaged	1
Ernest	1
entered	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
me	1
arrive	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
welcome	1
me	1
Welcome	1
my	1
dearest	1
Victor	1
said	1
he	1
Ah	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
come	1
three	1
months	1
ago	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
us	1
all	1
joyous	1
and	1
delighted	1
You	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
now	1
to	1
share	1
a	1
misery	1
which	1
nothing	1
can	1
alleviate	1
yet	1
your	1
presence	1
will	1
I	1
hope	1
revive	1
our	1
father	1
who	1
seems	1
sinking	1
under	1
his	1
misfortune	1
and	1
your	1
persuasions	1
will	1
induce	1
poor	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
cease	1
her	1
vain	1
and	1
tormenting	1
self	1
accusations	1
Poor	1
William	1
he	1
was	1
our	1
darling	1
and	1
our	1
pride	1
Tears	1
unrestrained	1
fell	1
from	1
my	1
brother	1
s	1
eyes	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
mortal	1
agony	1
crept	1
over	1
my	1
frame	1
Before	1
I	1
had	1
only	1
imagined	1
the	1
wretchedness	1
of	1
my	1
desolated	1
home	1
the	1
reality	1
came	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
a	1
not	1
less	1
terrible	1
disaster	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
calm	1
Ernest	1
I	1
enquired	1
more	1
minutely	1
concerning	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
named	1
my	1
cousin	1
She	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
said	1
Ernest	1
requires	1
consolation	1
she	1
accused	1
herself	1
of	1
having	1
caused	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
very	1
wretched	1
But	1
since	1
the	1
murderer	1
has	1
been	1
discovered	1
The	1
murderer	1
discovered	1
Good	1
God	1
how	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
who	1
could	1
attempt	1
to	1
pursue	1
him	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
one	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
try	1
to	1
overtake	1
the	1
winds	1
or	1
confine	1
a	1
mountain	1
stream	1
with	1
a	1
straw	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
too	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
last	1
night	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
replied	1
my	1
brother	1
in	1
accents	1
of	1
wonder	1
but	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
discovery	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
completes	1
our	1
misery	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
believe	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
Elizabeth	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
convinced	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
the	1
evidence	1
Indeed	1
who	1
would	1
credit	1
that	1
Justine	1
Moritz	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
amiable	1
and	1
fond	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
could	1
suddenly	1
become	1
so	1
capable	1
of	1
so	1
frightful	1
so	1
appalling	1
a	1
crime	1
Justine	1
Moritz	1
Poor	1
poor	1
girl	1
is	1
she	1
the	1
accused	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
wrongfully	1
every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
believes	1
it	1
surely	1
Ernest	1
No	1
one	1
did	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
several	1
circumstances	1
came	1
out	1
that	1
have	1
almost	1
forced	1
conviction	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
behaviour	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
confused	1
as	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
facts	1
a	1
weight	1
that	1
I	1
fear	1
leaves	1
no	1
hope	1
for	1
doubt	1
But	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
tried	1
today	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
then	1
hear	1
all	1
He	1
then	1
related	1
that	1
the	1
morning	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
poor	1
William	1
had	1
been	1
discovered	1
Justine	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
ill	1
and	1
confined	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
During	1
this	1
interval	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
happening	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
apparel	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
discovered	1
in	1
her	1
pocket	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
judged	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
the	1
murderer	1
The	1
servant	1
instantly	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
deposition	1
Justine	1
was	1
apprehended	1
On	1
being	1
charged	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
confirmed	1
the	1
suspicion	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
by	1
her	1
extreme	1
confusion	1
of	1
manner	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
tale	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
shake	1
my	1
faith	1
and	1
I	1
replied	1
earnestly	1
You	1
are	1
all	1
mistaken	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
murderer	1
Justine	1
poor	1
good	1
Justine	1
is	1
innocent	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
I	1
saw	1
unhappiness	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
on	1
his	1
countenance	1
but	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
welcome	1
me	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
exchanged	1
our	1
mournful	1
greeting	1
would	1
have	1
introduced	1
some	1
other	1
topic	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
our	1
disaster	1
had	1
not	1
Ernest	1
exclaimed	1
Good	1
God	1
papa	1
Victor	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
poor	1
William	1
We	1
do	1
also	1
unfortunately	1
replied	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
indeed	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
ever	1
ignorant	1
than	1
have	1
discovered	1
so	1
much	1
depravity	1
and	1
ungratitude	1
in	1
one	1
I	1
valued	1
so	1
highly	1
My	1
dear	1
father	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
Justine	1
is	1
innocent	1
If	1
she	1
is	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
suffer	1
as	1
guilty	1
She	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
today	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
acquitted	1
This	1
speech	1
calmed	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
Justine	1
and	1
indeed	1
every	1
human	1
being	1
was	1
guiltless	1
of	1
this	1
murder	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
fear	1
therefore	1
that	1
any	1
circumstantial	1
evidence	1
could	1
be	1
brought	1
forward	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
convict	1
her	1
My	1
tale	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
announce	1
publicly	1
its	1
astounding	1
horror	1
would	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
madness	1
by	1
the	1
vulgar	1
Did	1
any	1
one	1
indeed	1
exist	1
except	1
I	1
the	1
creator	1
who	1
would	1
believe	1
unless	1
his	1
senses	1
convinced	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
monument	1
of	1
presumption	1
and	1
rash	1
ignorance	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
We	1
were	1
soon	1
joined	1
by	1
Elizabeth	1
Time	1
had	1
altered	1
her	1
since	1
I	1
last	1
beheld	1
her	1
it	1
had	1
endowed	1
her	1
with	1
loveliness	1
surpassing	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
childish	1
years	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
candour	1
the	1
same	1
vivacity	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
allied	1
to	1
an	1
expression	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
sensibility	1
and	1
intellect	1
She	1
welcomed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
affection	1
Your	1
arrival	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
said	1
she	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
hope	1
You	1
perhaps	1
will	1
find	1
some	1
means	1
to	1
justify	1
my	1
poor	1
guiltless	1
Justine	1
Alas	1
who	1
is	1
safe	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
convicted	1
of	1
crime	1
I	1
rely	1
on	1
her	1
innocence	1
as	1
certainly	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
upon	1
my	1
own	1
Our	1
misfortune	1
is	1
doubly	1
hard	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
lost	1
that	1
lovely	1
darling	1
boy	1
but	1
this	1
poor	1
girl	1
whom	1
I	1
sincerely	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
torn	1
away	1
by	1
even	1
a	1
worse	1
fate	1
If	1
she	1
is	1
condemned	1
I	1
never	1
shall	1
know	1
joy	1
more	1
But	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
again	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
sad	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
William	1
She	1
is	1
innocent	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
said	1
I	1
and	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
proved	1
fear	1
nothing	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
spirits	1
be	1
cheered	1
by	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
her	1
acquittal	1
How	1
kind	1
and	1
generous	1
you	1
are	1
every	1
one	1
else	1
believes	1
in	1
her	1
guilt	1
and	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
wretched	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
every	1
one	1
else	1
prejudiced	1
in	1
so	1
deadly	1
a	1
manner	1
rendered	1
me	1
hopeless	1
and	1
despairing	1
She	1
wept	1
Dearest	1
niece	1
said	1
my	1
father	1
dry	1
your	1
tears	1
If	1
she	1
is	1
as	1
you	1
believe	1
innocent	1
rely	1
on	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
our	1
laws	1
and	1
the	1
activity	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
prevent	1
the	1

shadow	1
of	1
partiality	1
Chapter	1
8	1
We	1
passed	1
a	1
few	1
sad	1
hours	1
until	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
the	1
trial	1
was	1
to	1
commence	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
attend	1
as	1
witnesses	1
I	1
accompanied	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
During	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
wretched	1
mockery	1
of	1
justice	1
I	1
suffered	1
living	1
torture	1
It	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
whether	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
my	1
curiosity	1
and	1
lawless	1
devices	1
would	1
cause	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
beings	1
one	1
a	1
smiling	1
babe	1
full	1
of	1
innocence	1
and	1
joy	1
the	1
other	1
far	1
more	1
dreadfully	1
murdered	1
with	1
every	1
aggravation	1
of	1
infamy	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
murder	1
memorable	1
in	1
horror	1
Justine	1
also	1
was	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
merit	1
and	1
possessed	1
qualities	1
which	1
promised	1
to	1
render	1
her	1
life	1
happy	1
now	1
all	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
obliterated	1
in	1
an	1
ignominious	1
grave	1
and	1
I	1
the	1
cause	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
rather	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
confessed	1
myself	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
ascribed	1
to	1
Justine	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
absent	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
committed	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
declaration	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
ravings	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
exculpated	1
her	1
who	1
suffered	1
through	1
me	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
Justine	1
was	1
calm	1
She	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
mourning	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
always	1
engaging	1
was	1
rendered	1
by	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
exquisitely	1
beautiful	1
Yet	1
she	1
appeared	1
confident	1
in	1
innocence	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
tremble	1
although	1
gazed	1
on	1
and	1
execrated	1
by	1
thousands	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
kindness	1
which	1
her	1
beauty	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
excited	1
was	1
obliterated	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
spectators	1
by	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
enormity	1
she	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
committed	1
She	1
was	1
tranquil	1
yet	1
her	1
tranquillity	1
was	1
evidently	1
constrained	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
confusion	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
adduced	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
her	1
guilt	1
she	1
worked	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
courage	1
When	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
court	1
she	1
threw	1
her	1
eyes	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
quickly	1
discovered	1
where	1
we	1
were	1
seated	1
A	1
tear	1
seemed	1
to	1
dim	1
her	1
eye	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
us	1
but	1
she	1
quickly	1
recovered	1
herself	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
sorrowful	1
affection	1
seemed	1
to	1
attest	1
her	1
utter	1
guiltlessness	1
The	1
trial	1
began	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
advocate	1
against	1
her	1
had	1
stated	1
the	1
charge	1
several	1
witnesses	1
were	1
called	1
Several	1
strange	1
facts	1
combined	1
against	1
her	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
staggered	1
anyone	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
such	1
proof	1
of	1
her	1
innocence	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
been	1
committed	1
and	1
towards	1
morning	1
had	1
been	1
perceived	1
by	1
a	1
market	1
woman	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
murdered	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
afterwards	1
found	1
The	1
woman	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
there	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
very	1
strangely	1
and	1
only	1
returned	1
a	1
confused	1
and	1
unintelligible	1
answer	1
She	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
when	1
one	1
inquired	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
demanded	1
earnestly	1
if	1
anything	1
had	1
been	1
heard	1
concerning	1
him	1
When	1
shown	1
the	1
body	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
violent	1
hysterics	1
and	1
kept	1
her	1
bed	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
The	1
picture	1
was	1
then	1
produced	1
which	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
her	1
pocket	1
and	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
a	1
faltering	1
voice	1
proved	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
missed	1
she	1
had	1
placed	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
a	1
murmur	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
indignation	1
filled	1
the	1
court	1
Justine	1
was	1
called	1
on	1
for	1
her	1
defence	1
As	1
the	1
trial	1
had	1
proceeded	1
her	1
countenance	1
had	1
altered	1
Surprise	1
horror	1
and	1
misery	1
were	1
strongly	1
expressed	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
struggled	1
with	1
her	1
tears	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
desired	1
to	1
plead	1
she	1
collected	1
her	1
powers	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
an	1
audible	1
although	1
variable	1
voice	1
God	1
knows	1
she	1
said	1
how	1
entirely	1
I	1
am	1
innocent	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
that	1
my	1
protestations	1
should	1
acquit	1
me	1
I	1
rest	1
my	1
innocence	1
on	1
a	1
plain	1
and	1
simple	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
adduced	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
the	1
character	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
borne	1
will	1
incline	1
my	1
judges	1
to	1
a	1
favourable	1
interpretation	1
where	1
any	1
circumstance	1
appears	1
doubtful	1
or	1
suspicious	1
She	1
then	1
related	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
permission	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
been	1
committed	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
an	1
aunt	1
at	1
Ch^ene	1
a	1
village	1
situated	1
at	1
about	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
Geneva	1
On	1
her	1
return	1
at	1
about	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
she	1
met	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
who	1
was	1
lost	1
She	1
was	1
alarmed	1
by	1
this	1
account	1
and	1
passed	1
several	1
hours	1
in	1
looking	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Geneva	1
were	1
shut	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
remain	1
several	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
barn	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
cottage	1
being	1
unwilling	1
to	1
call	1
up	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
spent	1
here	1
watching	1
towards	1
morning	1
she	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
slept	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
some	1
steps	1
disturbed	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
awoke	1
It	1
was	1
dawn	1
and	1
she	1
quitted	1
her	1
asylum	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
again	1
endeavour	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
brother	1
If	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
his	1
body	1
lay	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
her	1
knowledge	1
That	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
bewildered	1
when	1
questioned	1
by	1
the	1
market	1
woman	1
was	1
not	1
surprising	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
poor	1
William	1
was	1
yet	1
uncertain	1
Concerning	1
the	1
picture	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
account	1
I	1
know	1
continued	1
the	1
unhappy	1
victim	1
how	1
heavily	1
and	1
fatally	1
this	1
one	1
circumstance	1
weighs	1
against	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
of	1
explaining	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
expressed	1
my	1
utter	1
ignorance	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
left	1
to	1
conjecture	1
concerning	1
the	1
probabilities	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
But	1
here	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
checked	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
enemy	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
none	1
surely	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
wicked	1
as	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
wantonly	1
Did	1
the	1
murderer	1
place	1
it	1
there	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
no	1
opportunity	1
afforded	1
him	1
for	1
so	1
doing	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
have	1
stolen	1
the	1
jewel	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it	1
again	1
so	1
soon	1
I	1
commit	1
my	1
cause	1
to	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
my	1
judges	1
yet	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
hope	1
I	1
beg	1
permission	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
witnesses	1
examined	1
concerning	1
my	1
character	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
testimony	1
shall	1
not	1
overweigh	1
my	1
supposed	1
guilt	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
condemned	1
although	1
I	1
would	1
pledge	1
my	1
salvation	1
on	1
my	1
innocence	1
Several	1
witnesses	1
were	1
called	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
they	1
spoke	1
well	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
fear	1
and	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
supposed	1
her	1
guilty	1
rendered	1
them	1
timorous	1
and	1
unwilling	1
to	1
come	1
forward	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
even	1
this	1
last	1
resource	1
her	1
excellent	1
dispositions	1
and	1
irreproachable	1
conduct	1
about	1
to	1
fail	1
the	1
accused	1
when	1
although	1
violently	1
agitated	1
she	1
desired	1
permission	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
court	1
I	1
am	1
said	1
she	1
the	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
unhappy	1
child	1
who	1
was	1
murdered	1
or	1
rather	1
his	1
sister	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
educated	1
by	1
and	1
have	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
parents	1
ever	1
since	1
and	1
even	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
birth	1
It	1
may	1
therefore	1
be	1
judged	1
indecent	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
forward	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
fellow	1
creature	1
about	1
to	1
perish	1
through	1
the	1
cowardice	1
of	1
her	1
pretended	1
friends	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
her	1
character	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
accused	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
for	1
five	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
During	1
all	1
that	1
period	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
and	1
benevolent	1
of	1
human	1
creatures	1
She	1
nursed	1
Madame	1
Frankenstein	1
my	1
aunt	1
in	1
her	1
last	1
illness	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
affection	1
and	1
care	1
and	1
afterwards	1
attended	1
her	1
own	1
mother	1
during	1
a	1
tedious	1
illness	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
excited	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
after	1
which	1
she	1
again	1
lived	1
in	1
my	1
uncle	1
s	1
house	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
beloved	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
She	1
was	1
warmly	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
dead	1
and	1
acted	1
towards	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
most	1
affectionate	1
mother	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
the	1
evidence	1
produced	1
against	1
her	1
I	1
believe	1
and	1
rely	1
on	1
her	1
perfect	1
innocence	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
temptation	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
action	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
bauble	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
chief	1
proof	1
rests	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
earnestly	1
desired	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
willingly	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
do	1
I	1
esteem	1
and	1
value	1
her	1
A	1
murmur	1
of	1
approbation	1
followed	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
simple	1
and	1
powerful	1
appeal	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
excited	1
by	1
her	1
generous	1
interference	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
poor	1
Justine	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
public	1
indignation	1
was	1
turned	1
with	1
renewed	1
violence	1
charging	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
blackest	1
ingratitude	1
She	1
herself	1
wept	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
spoke	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
My	1
own	1
agitation	1
and	1
anguish	1
was	1
extreme	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
trial	1
I	1
believed	1
in	1
her	1
innocence	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
Could	1
the	1
daemon	1
who	1
had	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
doubt	1
murdered	1
my	1
brother	1
also	1
in	1
his	1
hellish	1
sport	1
have	1
betrayed	1
the	1
innocent	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
ignominy	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
sustain	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
situation	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
popular	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
had	1
already	1
condemned	1
my	1
unhappy	1
victim	1
I	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
agony	1
The	1
tortures	1
of	1
the	1
accused	1
did	1
not	1
equal	1
mine	1
she	1
was	1
sustained	1
by	1
innocence	1
but	1
the	1
fangs	1
of	1
remorse	1
tore	1
my	1
bosom	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
forgo	1
their	1
hold	1
I	1
passed	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
unmingled	1
wretchedness	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
my	1
lips	1
and	1
throat	1
were	1
parched	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
ask	1
the	1
fatal	1
question	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
known	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
guessed	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
visit	1
The	1
ballots	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
black	1
and	1
Justine	1
was	1
condemned	1
I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
I	1
then	1
felt	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
experienced	1
sensations	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
them	1
adequate	1
expressions	1
but	1
words	1
cannot	1
convey	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
sickening	1
despair	1
that	1
I	1
then	1
endured	1
The	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
addressed	1
myself	1
added	1
that	1
Justine	1
had	1
already	1
confessed	1
her	1
guilt	1
That	1
evidence	1
he	1
observed	1
was	1
hardly	1
required	1
in	1
so	1
glaring	1
a	1
case	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
indeed	1
none	1
of	1
our	1
judges	1
like	1
to	1
condemn	1
a	1
criminal	1
upon	1
circumstantial	1
evidence	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
decisive	1
This	1
was	1
strange	1
and	1
unexpected	1
intelligence	1
what	1
could	1
it	1
mean	1
Had	1
my	1
eyes	1
deceived	1
me	1
And	1
was	1
I	1
really	1
as	1
mad	1
as	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
would	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
if	1
I	1
disclosed	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
suspicions	1
I	1
hastened	1
to	1
return	1
home	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
eagerly	1
demanded	1
the	1
result	1
My	1
cousin	1
replied	1
I	1
it	1
is	1
decided	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
expected	1
all	1
judges	1
had	1
rather	1
that	1
ten	1
innocent	1
should	1
suffer	1
than	1
that	1
one	1
guilty	1
should	1
escape	1
But	1
she	1
has	1
confessed	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
dire	1
blow	1
to	1
poor	1
Elizabeth	1
who	1
had	1
relied	1
with	1
firmness	1
upon	1
Justine	1
s	1
innocence	1
Alas	1
said	1
she	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
ever	1
again	1
believe	1
in	1
human	1
goodness	1
Justine	1
whom	1
I	1
loved	1
and	1
esteemed	1
as	1
my	1
sister	1
how	1
could	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
those	1
smiles	1
of	1
innocence	1
only	1
to	1
betray	1
Her	1
mild	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
severity	1
or	1
guile	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
has	1
committed	1
a	1
murder	1
Soon	1
after	1
we	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
victim	1
had	1
expressed	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
cousin	1
My	1
father	1
wished	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
judgment	1
and	1
feelings	1
to	1
decide	1
Yes	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
although	1
she	1
is	1
guilty	1
and	1
you	1
Victor	1
shall	1
accompany	1
me	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
alone	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
visit	1
was	1
torture	1
to	1
me	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
We	1
entered	1
the	1
gloomy	1
prison	1
chamber	1
and	1
beheld	1
Justine	1
sitting	1
on	1
some	1
straw	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
manacled	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
rested	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
She	1
rose	1
on	1
seeing	1
us	1
enter	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
threw	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
weeping	1
bitterly	1
My	1
cousin	1
wept	1
also	1
Oh	1
Justine	1
said	1
she	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
last	1
consolation	1
I	1
relied	1
on	1
your	1
innocence	1
and	1
although	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
very	1
wretched	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
miserable	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
also	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
very	1
very	1
wicked	1
Do	1
you	1
also	1
join	1
with	1
my	1
enemies	1
to	1
crush	1
me	1
to	1
condemn	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
murderer	1
Her	1
voice	1
was	1
suffocated	1
with	1
sobs	1
Rise	1
my	1
poor	1
girl	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
kneel	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
innocent	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
I	1
believed	1
you	1
guiltless	1
notwithstanding	1
every	1
evidence	1
until	1
I	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
yourself	1
declared	1
your	1
guilt	1
That	1
report	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
false	1
and	1
be	1
assured	1
dear	1
Justine	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
shake	1
my	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
your	1
own	1
confession	1
I	1
did	1
confess	1
but	1
I	1
confessed	1
a	1
lie	1
I	1
confessed	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
obtain	1
absolution	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
falsehood	1
lies	1
heavier	1
at	1
my	1
heart	1
than	1
all	1
my	1
other	1
sins	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
forgive	1
me	1
Ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
condemned	1
my	1
confessor	1
has	1
besieged	1
me	1
he	1
threatened	1
and	1
menaced	1
until	1
I	1
almost	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
monster	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
He	1
threatened	1
excommunication	1
and	1
hell	1
fire	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
moments	1
if	1
I	1
continued	1
obdurate	1
Dear	1
lady	1
I	1
had	1
none	1
to	1
support	1
me	1
all	1
looked	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
wretch	1
doomed	1
to	1
ignominy	1
and	1
perdition	1
What	1
could	1
I	1
do	1
In	1
an	1
evil	1
hour	1
I	1
subscribed	1
to	1
a	1
lie	1
and	1
now	1
only	1
am	1
I	1
truly	1
miserable	1
She	1
paused	1
weeping	1
and	1
then	1
continued	1
I	1
thought	1
with	1
horror	1
my	1
sweet	1
lady	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
believe	1
your	1
Justine	1
whom	1
your	1
blessed	1
aunt	1
had	1
so	1
highly	1
honoured	1
and	1
whom	1
you	1
loved	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
crime	1
which	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
could	1
have	1
perpetrated	1
Dear	1
William	1
dearest	1
blessed	1
child	1
I	1
soon	1
shall	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
in	1
heaven	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
that	1
consoles	1
me	1
going	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
suffer	1
ignominy	1
and	1
death	1
Oh	1
Justine	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
distrusted	1
you	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
confess	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
mourn	1
dear	1
girl	1
Do	1
not	1
fear	1
I	1
will	1
proclaim	1
I	1
will	1
prove	1
your	1
innocence	1
I	1
will	1
melt	1
the	1
stony	1
hearts	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
by	1
my	1
tears	1
and	1
prayers	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
die	1
You	1
my	1
playfellow	1
my	1
companion	1
my	1
sister	1
perish	1
on	1
the	1
scaffold	1
No	1
No	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
survive	1
so	1
horrible	1
a	1
misfortune	1
Justine	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
mournfully	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
die	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
pang	1
is	1
past	1
God	1
raises	1
my	1
weakness	1
and	1
gives	1
me	1
courage	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
worst	1
I	1
leave	1
a	1
sad	1
and	1
bitter	1
world	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
unjustly	1
condemned	1
I	1
am	1
resigned	1
to	1
the	1
fate	1
awaiting	1
me	1
Learn	1
from	1
me	1
dear	1
lady	1
to	1
submit	1
in	1
patience	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
heaven	1
During	1
this	1
conversation	1
I	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
room	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
conceal	1
the	1
horrid	1
anguish	1
that	1
possessed	1
me	1
Despair	1
Who	1
dared	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
The	1
poor	1
victim	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
awful	1
boundary	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
felt	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
such	1
deep	1
and	1
bitter	1
agony	1
I	1
gnashed	1
my	1
teeth	1
and	1
ground	1
them	1
together	1
uttering	1
a	1
groan	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
my	1
inmost	1
soul	1
Justine	1
started	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
approached	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
Dear	1
sir	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
visit	1
me	1
you	1
I	1
hope	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
guilty	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
No	1
Justine	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
he	1
is	1
more	1
convinced	1
of	1
your	1
innocence	1
than	1
I	1
was	1
for	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
confessed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
credit	1
it	1
I	1
truly	1
thank	1
him	1
In	1
these	1
last	1
moments	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
sincerest	1
gratitude	1
towards	1
those	1
who	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
with	1
kindness	1
How	1
sweet	1
is	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
others	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
wretch	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
It	1
removes	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
my	1
misfortune	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
die	1
in	1
peace	1
now	1
that	1
my	1
innocence	1
is	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
you	1
dear	1
lady	1
and	1
your	1
cousin	1
Thus	1
the	1
poor	1
sufferer	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
others	1
and	1
herself	1
She	1
indeed	1
gained	1
the	1
resignation	1
she	1
desired	1
But	1
I	1
the	1
true	1
murderer	1
felt	1
the	1
never	1
dying	1
worm	1
alive	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
which	1
allowed	1
of	1
no	1
hope	1
or	1
consolation	1
Elizabeth	1
also	1
wept	1
and	1
was	1
unhappy	1
but	1
hers	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
innocence	1
which	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
that	1
passes	1
over	1
the	1
fair	1
moon	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
hides	1
but	1
cannot	1
tarnish	1
its	1
brightness	1
Anguish	1
and	1
despair	1
had	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
bore	1
a	1
hell	1
within	1
me	1
which	1
nothing	1
could	1
extinguish	1
We	1
stayed	1
several	1
hours	1
with	1
Justine	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
tear	1
herself	1
away	1
I	1
wish	1
cried	1
she	1
that	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
cannot	1
live	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
of	1
misery	1
Justine	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
while	1
she	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressed	1
her	1
bitter	1
tears	1
She	1
embraced	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
half	1
suppressed	1
emotion	1
Farewell	1
sweet	1
lady	1
dearest	1
Elizabeth	1
my	1
beloved	1
and	1
only	1
friend	1
may	1
heaven	1
in	1
its	1
bounty	1
bless	1
and	1
preserve	1
you	1
may	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
misfortune	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
ever	1
suffer	1
Live	1
and	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
make	1
others	1
so	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Justine	1
died	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
heart	1
rending	1
eloquence	1
failed	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
judges	1
from	1
their	1
settled	1
conviction	1
in	1
the	1
criminality	1
of	1
the	1
saintly	1
sufferer	1
My	1
passionate	1
and	1
indignant	1
appeals	1
were	1
lost	1
upon	1
them	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
received	1
their	1
cold	1
answers	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
harsh	1
unfeeling	1
reasoning	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
my	1
purposed	1
avowal	1
died	1
away	1
on	1
my	1
lips	1
Thus	1
I	1
might	1
proclaim	1
myself	1
a	1
madman	1
but	1
not	1
revoke	1
the	1
sentence	1
passed	1
upon	1
my	1
wretched	1
victim	1
She	1
perished	1
on	1
the	1
scaffold	1
as	1
a	1
murderess	1
From	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
voiceless	1
grief	1
of	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
This	1
also	1
was	1
my	1
doing	1
And	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
woe	1
and	1
the	1
desolation	1
of	1
that	1
late	1
so	1
smiling	1
home	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
thrice	1
accursed	1
hands	1
Ye	1
weep	1
unhappy	1
ones	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
last	1
tears	1
Again	1
shall	1
you	1
raise	1
the	1
funeral	1
wail	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
your	1
lamentations	1
shall	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
be	1
heard	1
Frankenstein	1
your	1
son	1
your	1
kinsman	1
your	1
early	1
much	1
loved	1
friend	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
spend	1
each	1
vital	1
drop	1
of	1
blood	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
who	1
has	1
no	1
thought	1
nor	1
sense	1
of	1
joy	1
except	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
mirrored	1
also	1
in	1
your	1
dear	1
countenances	1
who	1
would	1
fill	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
blessings	1
and	1
spend	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
serving	1
you	1
he	1
bids	1
you	1
weep	1
to	1
shed	1
countless	1
tears	1
happy	1
beyond	1
his	1
hopes	1
if	1
thus	1
inexorable	1
fate	1
be	1
satisfied	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
destruction	1
pause	1
before	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
grave	1
have	1
succeeded	1
to	1
your	1
sad	1
torments	1
Thus	1
spoke	1
my	1
prophetic	1
soul	1
as	1
torn	1

Chapter	1
9	1
Nothing	1
is	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
than	1
after	1
the	1
feelings	1
have	1
been	1
worked	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
quick	1
succession	1
of	1
events	1
the	1
dead	1
calmness	1
of	1
inaction	1
and	1
certainty	1
which	1
follows	1
and	1
deprives	1
the	1
soul	1
both	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
fear	1
Justine	1
died	1
she	1
rested	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
alive	1
The	1
blood	1
flowed	1
freely	1
in	1
my	1
veins	1
but	1
a	1
weight	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
remorse	1
pressed	1
on	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
nothing	1
could	1
remove	1
Sleep	1
fled	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
I	1
wandered	1
like	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
committed	1
deeds	1
of	1
mischief	1
beyond	1
description	1
horrible	1
and	1
more	1
much	1
more	1
I	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
was	1
yet	1
behind	1
Yet	1
my	1
heart	1
overflowed	1
with	1
kindness	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
virtue	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
life	1
with	1
benevolent	1
intentions	1
and	1
thirsted	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
practice	1
and	1
make	1
myself	1
useful	1
to	1
my	1
fellow	1
beings	1
Now	1
all	1
was	1
blasted	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
serenity	1
of	1
conscience	1
which	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
past	1
with	1
self	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
gather	1
promise	1
of	1
new	1
hopes	1
I	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
remorse	1
and	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
guilt	1
which	1
hurried	1
me	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
hell	1
of	1
intense	1
tortures	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
language	1
can	1
describe	1
This	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
preyed	1
upon	1
my	1
health	1
which	1
had	1
perhaps	1
never	1
entirely	1
recovered	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
shock	1
it	1
had	1
sustained	1
I	1
shunned	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
man	1
all	1
sound	1
of	1
joy	1
or	1
complacency	1
was	1
torture	1
to	1
me	1
solitude	1
was	1
my	1
only	1
consolation	1
deep	1
dark	1
deathlike	1
solitude	1
My	1
father	1
observed	1
with	1
pain	1
the	1
alteration	1
perceptible	1
in	1
my	1
disposition	1
and	1
habits	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
by	1
arguments	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
his	1
serene	1
conscience	1
and	1
guiltless	1
life	1
to	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
fortitude	1
and	1
awaken	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
dispel	1
the	1
dark	1
cloud	1
which	1
brooded	1
over	1
me	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
Victor	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
suffer	1
also	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
love	1
a	1
child	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
loved	1
your	1
brother	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
but	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
the	1
survivors	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
refrain	1
from	1
augmenting	1
their	1
unhappiness	1
by	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
immoderate	1
grief	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
duty	1
owed	1
to	1
yourself	1
for	1
excessive	1
sorrow	1
prevents	1
improvement	1
or	1
enjoyment	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
daily	1
usefulness	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
fit	1
for	1
society	1
This	1
advice	1
although	1
good	1
was	1
totally	1
inapplicable	1
to	1
my	1
case	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
hide	1
my	1
grief	1
and	1
console	1
my	1
friends	1
if	1
remorse	1
had	1
not	1
mingled	1
its	1
bitterness	1
and	1
terror	1
its	1
alarm	1
with	1
my	1
other	1
sensations	1
Now	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
answer	1
my	1
father	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
hide	1
myself	1
from	1
his	1
view	1
About	1
this	1
time	1
we	1
retired	1
to	1
our	1
house	1
at	1
Belrive	1
This	1
change	1
was	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
to	1
me	1
The	1
shutting	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
regularly	1
at	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
remaining	1
on	1
the	1
lake	1
after	1
that	1
hour	1
had	1
rendered	1
our	1
residence	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Geneva	1
very	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
now	1
free	1
Often	1
after	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
retired	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
passed	1
many	1
hours	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
Sometimes	1
with	1
my	1
sails	1
set	1
I	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
sometimes	1
after	1
rowing	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
boat	1
to	1
pursue	1
its	1
own	1
course	1
and	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
miserable	1
reflections	1
I	1
was	1
often	1
tempted	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
around	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
the	1
only	1
unquiet	1
thing	1
that	1
wandered	1
restless	1
in	1
a	1
scene	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
heavenly	1
if	1
I	1
except	1
some	1
bat	1
or	1
the	1
frogs	1
whose	1
harsh	1
and	1
interrupted	1
croaking	1
was	1
heard	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
approached	1
the	1
shore	1
often	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
was	1
tempted	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
the	1
silent	1
lake	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
might	1
close	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
calamities	1
for	1
ever	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
restrained	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
heroic	1
and	1
suffering	1
Elizabeth	1
whom	1
I	1
tenderly	1
loved	1
and	1
whose	1
existence	1
was	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
mine	1
I	1
thought	1
also	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
surviving	1
brother	1
should	1
I	1
by	1
my	1
base	1
desertion	1
leave	1
them	1
exposed	1
and	1
unprotected	1
to	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
among	1
them	1
At	1
these	1
moments	1
I	1
wept	1
bitterly	1
and	1
wished	1
that	1
peace	1
would	1
revisit	1
my	1
mind	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
afford	1
them	1
consolation	1
and	1
happiness	1
But	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
Remorse	1
extinguished	1
every	1
hope	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
unalterable	1
evils	1
and	1
I	1
lived	1
in	1
daily	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
monster	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
should	1
perpetrate	1
some	1
new	1
wickedness	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
obscure	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
commit	1
some	1
signal	1
crime	1
which	1
by	1
its	1
enormity	1
should	1
almost	1
efface	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
There	1
was	1
always	1
scope	1
for	1
fear	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
anything	1
I	1
loved	1
remained	1
behind	1
My	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
this	1
fiend	1
cannot	1
be	1
conceived	1
When	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
gnashed	1
my	1
teeth	1
my	1
eyes	1
became	1
inflamed	1
and	1
I	1
ardently	1
wished	1
to	1
extinguish	1
that	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
thoughtlessly	1
bestowed	1
When	1
I	1
reflected	1
on	1
his	1
crimes	1
and	1
malice	1
my	1
hatred	1
and	1
revenge	1
burst	1
all	1
bounds	1
of	1
moderation	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
pilgrimage	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
peak	1
of	1
the	1
Andes	1
could	1
I	1
when	1
there	1
have	1
precipitated	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
base	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
again	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
wreak	1
the	1
utmost	1
extent	1
of	1
abhorrence	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
avenge	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
William	1
and	1
Justine	1
Our	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning	1
My	1
father	1
s	1
health	1
was	1
deeply	1
shaken	1
by	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
recent	1
events	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
sad	1
and	1
desponding	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
took	1
delight	1
in	1
her	1
ordinary	1
occupations	1
all	1
pleasure	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
sacrilege	1
toward	1
the	1
dead	1
eternal	1
woe	1
and	1
tears	1
she	1
then	1
thought	1
was	1
the	1
just	1
tribute	1
she	1
should	1
pay	1
to	1
innocence	1
so	1
blasted	1
and	1
destroyed	1
She	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
that	1
happy	1
creature	1
who	1
in	1
earlier	1
youth	1
wandered	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
ecstasy	1
of	1
our	1
future	1
prospects	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
those	1
sorrows	1
which	1
are	1
sent	1
to	1
wean	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
had	1
visited	1
her	1
and	1
its	1
dimming	1
influence	1
quenched	1
her	1
dearest	1
smiles	1
When	1
I	1
reflect	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
said	1
she	1
on	1
the	1
miserable	1
death	1
of	1
Justine	1
Moritz	1
I	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
its	1
works	1
as	1
they	1
before	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
Before	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
vice	1
and	1
injustice	1
that	1
I	1
read	1
in	1
books	1
or	1
heard	1
from	1
others	1
as	1
tales	1
of	1
ancient	1
days	1
or	1
imaginary	1
evils	1
at	1
least	1
they	1
were	1
remote	1
and	1
more	1
familiar	1
to	1
reason	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
imagination	1
but	1
now	1
misery	1
has	1
come	1
home	1
and	1
men	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
monsters	1
thirsting	1
for	1
each	1
other	1
s	1
blood	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
certainly	1
unjust	1
Everybody	1
believed	1
that	1
poor	1
girl	1
to	1
be	1
guilty	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
committed	1
the	1
crime	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
suffered	1
assuredly	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
depraved	1
of	1
human	1
creatures	1
For	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
jewels	1
to	1
have	1
murdered	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
her	1
benefactor	1
and	1
friend	1
a	1
child	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
nursed	1
from	1
its	1
birth	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
love	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
own	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
any	1
human	1
being	1
but	1
certainly	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
such	1
a	1
creature	1
unfit	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
men	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
innocent	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
feel	1
she	1
was	1
innocent	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
opinion	1
and	1
that	1
confirms	1
me	1
Alas	1
Victor	1
when	1
falsehood	1
can	1
look	1
so	1
like	1
the	1
truth	1
who	1
can	1
assure	1
themselves	1
of	1
certain	1
happiness	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
precipice	1
towards	1
which	1
thousands	1
are	1
crowding	1
and	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
plunge	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
abyss	1
William	1
and	1
Justine	1
were	1
assassinated	1
and	1
the	1
murderer	1
escapes	1
he	1
walks	1
about	1
the	1
world	1
free	1
and	1
perhaps	1
respected	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
condemned	1
to	1
suffer	1
on	1
the	1
scaffold	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
crimes	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
change	1
places	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
wretch	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
this	1
discourse	1
with	1
the	1
extremest	1
agony	1
I	1
not	1
in	1
deed	1
but	1
in	1
effect	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
murderer	1
Elizabeth	1
read	1
my	1
anguish	1
in	1
my	1
countenance	1
and	1
kindly	1
taking	1
my	1
hand	1
said	1
My	1
dearest	1
friend	1
you	1
must	1
calm	1
yourself	1
These	1
events	1
have	1
affected	1
me	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
deeply	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
wretched	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
sometimes	1
of	1
revenge	1
in	1
your	1
countenance	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
tremble	1
Dear	1
Victor	1
banish	1
these	1
dark	1
passions	1
Remember	1
the	1
friends	1
around	1
you	1
who	1
centre	1
all	1
their	1
hopes	1
in	1
you	1
Have	1
we	1
lost	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
rendering	1
you	1
happy	1
Ah	1
While	1
we	1
love	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
true	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
beauty	1
your	1
native	1
country	1
we	1
may	1
reap	1
every	1
tranquil	1
blessing	1
what	1
can	1
disturb	1
our	1
peace	1
And	1
could	1
not	1
such	1
words	1
from	1
her	1
whom	1
I	1
fondly	1
prized	1
before	1
every	1
other	1
gift	1
of	1
fortune	1
suffice	1
to	1
chase	1
away	1
the	1
fiend	1
that	1
lurked	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
Even	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
I	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
terror	1
lest	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
the	1
destroyer	1
had	1
been	1
near	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
Thus	1
not	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
friendship	1
nor	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
earth	1
nor	1
of	1
heaven	1
could	1
redeem	1
my	1
soul	1
from	1
woe	1
the	1
very	1
accents	1
of	1
love	1
were	1
ineffectual	1
I	1
was	1
encompassed	1
by	1
a	1
cloud	1
which	1
no	1
beneficial	1
influence	1
could	1
penetrate	1
The	1
wounded	1
deer	1
dragging	1
its	1
fainting	1
limbs	1
to	1
some	1
untrodden	1
brake	1
there	1
to	1
gaze	1
upon	1
the	1
arrow	1
which	1
had	1
pierced	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
me	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
could	1
cope	1
with	1
the	1
sullen	1
despair	1
that	1
overwhelmed	1
me	1
but	1
sometimes	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
passions	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
drove	1
me	1
to	1
seek	1
by	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
and	1
by	1
change	1
of	1
place	1
some	1
relief	1
from	1
my	1
intolerable	1
sensations	1
It	1
was	1
during	1
an	1
access	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
that	1
I	1
suddenly	1
left	1
my	1
home	1
and	1
bending	1
my	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
near	1
Alpine	1
valleys	1
sought	1
in	1
the	1
magnificence	1
the	1
eternity	1
of	1
such	1
scenes	1
to	1
forget	1
myself	1
and	1
my	1
ephemeral	1
because	1
human	1
sorrows	1
My	1
wanderings	1
were	1
directed	1
towards	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Chamounix	1
I	1
had	1
visited	1
it	1
frequently	1
during	1
my	1
boyhood	1
Six	1
years	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
wreck	1
but	1
nought	1
had	1
changed	1
in	1
those	1
savage	1
and	1
enduring	1
scenes	1
I	1
performed	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
on	1
horseback	1
I	1
afterwards	1
hired	1
a	1
mule	1
as	1
the	1
more	1
sure	1
footed	1
and	1
least	1
liable	1
to	1
receive	1
injury	1
on	1
these	1
rugged	1
roads	1
The	1
weather	1
was	1
fine	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
August	1
nearly	1
two	1
months	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Justine	1
that	1
miserable	1
epoch	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
dated	1
all	1
my	1
woe	1
The	1
weight	1
upon	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
sensibly	1
lightened	1
as	1
I	1
plunged	1
yet	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1
ravine	1
of	1
Arve	1
The	1
immense	1
mountains	1
and	1
precipices	1
that	1
overhung	1
me	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
raging	1
among	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
the	1
dashing	1
of	1
the	1
waterfalls	1
around	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
mighty	1
as	1
Omnipotence	1
and	1
I	1
ceased	1
to	1
fear	1
or	1
to	1
bend	1
before	1
any	1
being	1
less	1
almighty	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
created	1
and	1
ruled	1
the	1
elements	1
here	1
displayed	1
in	1
their	1
most	1
terrific	1
guise	1
Still	1
as	1
I	1
ascended	1
higher	1
the	1
valley	1
assumed	1
a	1
more	1
magnificent	1
and	1
astonishing	1
character	1
Ruined	1
castles	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
precipices	1
of	1
piny	1
mountains	1
the	1
impetuous	1
Arve	1
and	1
cottages	1
every	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
peeping	1
forth	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
formed	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
singular	1
beauty	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
augmented	1
and	1
rendered	1
sublime	1
by	1
the	1
mighty	1
Alps	1
whose	1
white	1
and	1
shining	1
pyramids	1
and	1
domes	1
towered	1
above	1
all	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
another	1
earth	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
another	1
race	1
of	1
beings	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
P'elissier	1
where	1
the	1
ravine	1
which	1
the	1
river	1
forms	1
opened	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
ascend	1
the	1
mountain	1
that	1
overhangs	1
it	1
Soon	1
after	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Chamounix	1
This	1
valley	1
is	1
more	1
wonderful	1
and	1
sublime	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
picturesque	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Servox	1
through	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
passed	1
The	1
high	1
and	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
were	1
its	1
immediate	1
boundaries	1
but	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
more	1
ruined	1
castles	1
and	1
fertile	1
fields	1
Immense	1
glaciers	1
approached	1
the	1
road	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
rumbling	1
thunder	1
of	1
the	1
falling	1
avalanche	1
and	1
marked	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
its	1
passage	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
the	1
supreme	1
and	1
magnificent	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
raised	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
surrounding	1
aiguilles	1
and	1
its	1
tremendous	1
d^ome	1
overlooked	1
the	1
valley	1
A	1
tingling	1
long	1
lost	1
sense	1
of	1
pleasure	1
often	1
came	1
across	1
me	1
during	1
this	1
journey	1
Some	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
some	1
new	1
object	1
suddenly	1
perceived	1
and	1
recognised	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
days	1
gone	1
by	1
and	1
were	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
lighthearted	1
gaiety	1
of	1
boyhood	1
The	1
very	1
winds	1
whispered	1
in	1
soothing	1
accents	1
and	1
maternal	1
Nature	1
bade	1
me	1
weep	1
no	1
more	1
Then	1
again	1
the	1
kindly	1
influence	1
ceased	1
to	1
act	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
fettered	1
again	1
to	1
grief	1
and	1
indulging	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
reflection	1
Then	1
I	1
spurred	1
on	1
my	1
animal	1
striving	1
so	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
world	1
my	1
fears	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
myself	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
desperate	1
fashion	1
I	1
alighted	1
and	1
threw	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
weighed	1
down	1
by	1
horror	1
and	1
despair	1
At	1
length	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Chamounix	1
Exhaustion	1
succeeded	1
to	1
the	1
extreme	1
fatigue	1
both	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
endured	1
For	1
a	1
short	1
space	1
of	1
time	1
I	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
watching	1
the	1
pallid	1
lightnings	1
that	1
played	1
above	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
the	1
Arve	1
which	1
pursued	1
its	1
noisy	1
way	1
beneath	1
The	1
same	1
lulling	1
sounds	1
acted	1
as	1
a	1
lullaby	1
to	1
my	1
too	1
keen	1
sensations	1
when	1
I	1
placed	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
my	1
pillow	1
sleep	1
crept	1
over	1
me	1
I	1
felt	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
giver	1
of	1
oblivion	1
Chapter	1
10	1
I	1
spent	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
roaming	1
through	1
the	1
valley	1
I	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
sources	1
of	1
the	1
Arveiron	1
which	1
take	1
their	1
rise	1
in	1
a	1
glacier	1
that	1
with	1
slow	1
pace	1
is	1
advancing	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
to	1
barricade	1
the	1
valley	1
The	1
abrupt	1
sides	1
of	1
vast	1
mountains	1
were	1
before	1
me	1
the	1
icy	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
glacier	1
overhung	1
me	1
a	1
few	1
shattered	1
pines	1
were	1
scattered	1
around	1
and	1
the	1
solemn	1
silence	1
of	1
this	1
glorious	1
presence	1
chamber	1
of	1
imperial	1
Nature	1
was	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
brawling	1
waves	1
or	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
some	1
vast	1
fragment	1
the	1
thunder	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
avalanche	1
or	1
the	1
cracking	1
reverberated	1
along	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
accumulated	1
ice	1
which	1
through	1
the	1
silent	1
working	1
of	1
immutable	1
laws	1
was	1
ever	1
and	1
anon	1
rent	1
and	1
torn	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
plaything	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
These	1
sublime	1
and	1
magnificent	1
scenes	1
afforded	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
consolation	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
receiving	1
They	1
elevated	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
littleness	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
although	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
remove	1
my	1
grief	1
they	1
subdued	1
and	1
tranquillised	1
it	1
In	1
some	1
degree	1
also	1
they	1
diverted	1
my	1
mind	1
from	1
the	1
thoughts	1
over	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
brooded	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
month	1
I	1
retired	1
to	1
rest	1
at	1
night	1
my	1
slumbers	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
waited	1
on	1
and	1
ministered	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
assemblance	1
of	1
grand	1
shapes	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
contemplated	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
They	1
congregated	1
round	1
me	1
the	1
unstained	1
snowy	1
mountain	1
top	1
the	1
glittering	1
pinnacle	1
the	1
pine	1
woods	1
and	1
ragged	1
bare	1
ravine	1
the	1
eagle	1
soaring	1
amidst	1
the	1
clouds	1
they	1
all	1
gathered	1
round	1
me	1
and	1
bade	1
me	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
Where	1
had	1
they	1
fled	1
when	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
I	1
awoke	1
All	1
of	1
soul	1
inspiriting	1
fled	1
with	1
sleep	1
and	1
dark	1
melancholy	1
clouded	1
every	1
thought	1
The	1
rain	1
was	1
pouring	1
in	1
torrents	1
and	1
thick	1
mists	1
hid	1
the	1
summits	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
even	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
mighty	1
friends	1
Still	1
I	1
would	1
penetrate	1
their	1
misty	1
veil	1
and	1
seek	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
cloudy	1
retreats	1
What	1
were	1
rain	1
and	1
storm	1
to	1
me	1
My	1
mule	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
ascend	1
to	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
Montanvert	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
and	1
ever	1
moving	1
glacier	1
had	1
produced	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
it	1
It	1
had	1
then	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sublime	1
ecstasy	1
that	1
gave	1
wings	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
soar	1
from	1
the	1
obscure	1
world	1
to	1
light	1
and	1
joy	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
awful	1
and	1
majestic	1
in	1
nature	1
had	1
indeed	1
always	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
solemnising	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
causing	1
me	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
passing	1
cares	1
of	1
life	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
a	1
guide	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
path	1
and	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
another	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
solitary	1
grandeur	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
The	1
ascent	1
is	1
precipitous	1
but	1
the	1
path	1
is	1
cut	1
into	1
continual	1
and	1
short	1
windings	1
which	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
surmount	1
the	1
perpendicularity	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
scene	1
terrifically	1
desolate	1
In	1
a	1
thousand	1
spots	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
avalanche	1
may	1
be	1
perceived	1
where	1
trees	1
lie	1
broken	1
and	1
strewed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
some	1
entirely	1
destroyed	1
others	1
bent	1
leaning	1
upon	1
the	1
jutting	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
or	1
transversely	1
upon	1
other	1
trees	1
The	1
path	1
as	1
you	1
ascend	1
higher	1
is	1
intersected	1
by	1
ravines	1
of	1
snow	1
down	1
which	1
stones	1
continually	1
roll	1
from	1
above	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
particularly	1
dangerous	1
as	1
the	1
slightest	1
sound	1
such	1
as	1
even	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
produces	1
a	1
concussion	1
of	1
air	1
sufficient	1
to	1
draw	1
destruction	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
speaker	1
The	1
pines	1
are	1
not	1
tall	1
or	1
luxuriant	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
sombre	1
and	1
add	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
severity	1
to	1
the	1
scene	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
valley	1
beneath	1
vast	1
mists	1
were	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
rivers	1
which	1
ran	1
through	1
it	1
and	1
curling	1
in	1
thick	1
wreaths	1
around	1
the	1
opposite	1
mountains	1
whose	1
summits	1
were	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
clouds	1
while	1
rain	1
poured	1
from	1
the	1
dark	1
sky	1
and	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
melancholy	1
impression	1
I	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
objects	1
around	1
me	1
Alas	1
Why	1
does	1
man	1
boast	1
of	1
sensibilities	1
superior	1
to	1
those	1
apparent	1
in	1
the	1
brute	1
it	1
only	1
renders	1
them	1
more	1
necessary	1
beings	1
If	1
our	1
impulses	1
were	1
confined	1
to	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
desire	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
nearly	1
free	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
moved	1
by	1
every	1
wind	1
that	1
blows	1
and	1
a	1
chance	1
word	1
or	1
scene	1
that	1
that	1
word	1
may	1
convey	1
to	1
us	1
We	1
rest	1
a	1
dream	1
has	1
power	1
to	1
poison	1
sleep	1
We	1
rise	1
one	1
wand	1
ring	1
thought	1
pollutes	1
the	1
day	1
We	1
feel	1
conceive	1
or	1
reason	1
laugh	1
or	1
weep	1
Embrace	1
fond	1
woe	1
or	1
cast	1
our	1
cares	1
away	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
be	1
it	1
joy	1
or	1
sorrow	1
The	1
path	1
of	1
its	1
departure	1
still	1
is	1
free	1
Man	1
s	1
yesterday	1
may	1
ne	1
er	1
be	1
like	1
his	1
morrow	1
Nought	1
may	1
endure	1
but	1
mutability	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
noon	1
when	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
ascent	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
I	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
that	1
overlooks	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
A	1
mist	1
covered	1
both	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
surrounding	1
mountains	1
Presently	1
a	1
breeze	1
dissipated	1
the	1
cloud	1
and	1
I	1
descended	1
upon	1
the	1
glacier	1
The	1
surface	1
is	1
very	1
uneven	1
rising	1
like	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
a	1
troubled	1
sea	1
descending	1
low	1
and	1
interspersed	1
by	1
rifts	1
that	1
sink	1
deep	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
ice	1
is	1
almost	1
a	1
league	1
in	1
width	1
but	1
I	1
spent	1
nearly	1
two	1
hours	1
in	1
crossing	1
it	1
The	1
opposite	1
mountain	1
is	1
a	1
bare	1
perpendicular	1
rock	1
From	1
the	1
side	1
where	1
I	1
now	1
stood	1
Montanvert	1
was	1
exactly	1
opposite	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
and	1
above	1
it	1
rose	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
in	1
awful	1
majesty	1
I	1
remained	1
in	1
a	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
gazing	1
on	1
this	1
wonderful	1
and	1
stupendous	1
scene	1
The	1
sea	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
vast	1
river	1
of	1
ice	1
wound	1
among	1
its	1
dependent	1
mountains	1
whose	1
aerial	1
summits	1
hung	1
over	1
its	1
recesses	1
Their	1
icy	1
and	1
glittering	1
peaks	1
shone	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
over	1
the	1
clouds	1
My	1
heart	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
sorrowful	1
now	1
swelled	1
with	1
something	1
like	1
joy	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
Wandering	1
spirits	1
if	1
indeed	1
ye	1
wander	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
rest	1
in	1
your	1
narrow	1
beds	1
allow	1
me	1
this	1
faint	1
happiness	1
or	1
take	1
me	1
as	1
your	1
companion	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
As	1
I	1
said	1
this	1
I	1
suddenly	1
beheld	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
advancing	1
towards	1
me	1
with	1
superhuman	1
speed	1
He	1
bounded	1
over	1
the	1
crevices	1
in	1
the	1
ice	1
among	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
walked	1
with	1
caution	1
his	1
stature	1
also	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
seemed	1
to	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
man	1
I	1
was	1
troubled	1
a	1
mist	1
came	1
over	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
faintness	1
seize	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
quickly	1
restored	1
by	1
the	1
cold	1
gale	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
I	1
perceived	1
as	1
the	1
shape	1
came	1
nearer	1
sight	1
tremendous	1
and	1
abhorred	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
I	1
trembled	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
horror	1
resolving	1
to	1
wait	1
his	1
approach	1
and	1
then	1
close	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
mortal	1
combat	1
He	1
approached	1
his	1
countenance	1
bespoke	1
bitter	1
anguish	1
combined	1
with	1
disdain	1
and	1
malignity	1
while	1
its	1
unearthly	1
ugliness	1
rendered	1
it	1
almost	1
too	1
horrible	1
for	1
human	1
eyes	1
But	1
I	1
scarcely	1
observed	1
this	1
rage	1
and	1
hatred	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
utterance	1
and	1
I	1
recovered	1
only	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
him	1
with	1
words	1
expressive	1
of	1
furious	1
detestation	1
and	1
contempt	1
Devil	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
do	1
you	1
dare	1
approach	1
me	1
And	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
fear	1
the	1
fierce	1
vengeance	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
wreaked	1
on	1
your	1
miserable	1
head	1
Begone	1
vile	1
insect	1
Or	1
rather	1
stay	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
trample	1
you	1
to	1
dust	1
And	1
oh	1
That	1
I	1
could	1
with	1
the	1
extinction	1
of	1
your	1
miserable	1
existence	1
restore	1
those	1
victims	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
diabolically	1
murdered	1
I	1
expected	1
this	1
reception	1
said	1
the	1
daemon	1
All	1
men	1
hate	1
the	1
wretched	1
how	1
then	1
must	1
I	1
be	1
hated	1
who	1
am	1
miserable	1
beyond	1
all	1
living	1
things	1
Yet	1
you	1
my	1
creator	1
detest	1
and	1
spurn	1
me	1
thy	1
creature	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
bound	1
by	1
ties	1
only	1
dissoluble	1
by	1
the	1
annihilation	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
You	1
purpose	1
to	1
kill	1
me	1
How	1
dare	1
you	1
sport	1
thus	1
with	1
life	1
Do	1
your	1
duty	1
towards	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
mine	1
towards	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
mankind	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
comply	1
with	1
my	1
conditions	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
them	1
and	1
you	1
at	1
peace	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
refuse	1
I	1
will	1
glut	1
the	1
maw	1
of	1
death	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
satiated	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
remaining	1
friends	1
Abhorred	1
monster	1
Fiend	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
The	1
tortures	1
of	1
hell	1
are	1
too	1
mild	1
a	1
vengeance	1
for	1
thy	1
crimes	1
Wretched	1
devil	1
You	1
reproach	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
creation	1
come	1
on	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
extinguish	1
the	1
spark	1
which	1
I	1
so	1
negligently	1
bestowed	1
My	1
rage	1
was	1
without	1
bounds	1
I	1
sprang	1
on	1
him	1
impelled	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
can	1
arm	1
one	1
being	1
against	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
another	1
He	1
easily	1
eluded	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
Be	1
calm	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
your	1
hatred	1
on	1
my	1
devoted	1
head	1
Have	1
I	1
not	1
suffered	1
enough	1
that	1
you	1
seek	1
to	1
increase	1
my	1
misery	1
Life	1
although	1
it	1
may	1
only	1
be	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
anguish	1
is	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
it	1
Remember	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
thyself	1
my	1
height	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
thine	1
my	1
joints	1
more	1
supple	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
set	1
myself	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
creature	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
even	1
mild	1
and	1
docile	1
to	1
my	1
natural	1
lord	1
and	1
king	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
also	1
perform	1
thy	1
part	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
owest	1
me	1
Oh	1
Frankenstein	1
be	1
not	1
equitable	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
and	1
trample	1
upon	1
me	1
alone	1
to	1
whom	1
thy	1
justice	1
and	1
even	1
thy	1
clemency	1
and	1
affection	1
is	1
most	1
due	1
Remember	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
creature	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
Adam	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
rather	1
the	1
fallen	1
angel	1
whom	1
thou	1
drivest	1
from	1
joy	1
for	1
no	1
misdeed	1
Everywhere	1
I	1
see	1
bliss	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
alone	1
am	1
irrevocably	1
excluded	1
I	1
was	1
benevolent	1
and	1
good	1
misery	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
fiend	1
Make	1
me	1
happy	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
again	1
be	1
virtuous	1
Begone	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
you	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
community	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
we	1
are	1
enemies	1
Begone	1
or	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
our	1
strength	1
in	1
a	1
fight	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
must	1
fall	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
move	1
thee	1
Will	1
no	1
entreaties	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
turn	1
a	1
favourable	1
eye	1
upon	1
thy	1
creature	1
who	1
implores	1
thy	1
goodness	1
and	1
compassion	1
Believe	1
me	1
Frankenstein	1
I	1
was	1
benevolent	1
my	1
soul	1
glowed	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
humanity	1
but	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
alone	1
miserably	1
alone	1
You	1
my	1
creator	1
abhor	1
me	1
what	1
hope	1
can	1
I	1
gather	1
from	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
who	1
owe	1
me	1
nothing	1
They	1
spurn	1
and	1
hate	1
me	1
The	1
desert	1
mountains	1
and	1
dreary	1
glaciers	1
are	1
my	1
refuge	1
I	1
have	1
wandered	1
here	1
many	1
days	1
the	1
caves	1
of	1
ice	1
which	1
I	1
only	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
are	1
a	1
dwelling	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
which	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
grudge	1
These	1
bleak	1
skies	1
I	1
hail	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
kinder	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
your	1
fellow	1
beings	1
If	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
mankind	1
knew	1
of	1
my	1
existence	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
and	1
arm	1
themselves	1
for	1
my	1
destruction	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
then	1
hate	1
them	1
who	1
abhor	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
no	1
terms	1
with	1
my	1
enemies	1
I	1
am	1
miserable	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
share	1
my	1
wretchedness	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
power	1
to	1
recompense	1
me	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
from	1
an	1
evil	1
which	1
it	1
only	1
remains	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
family	1
but	1
thousands	1
of	1
others	1
shall	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
its	1
rage	1
Let	1
your	1
compassion	1
be	1
moved	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
disdain	1
me	1
Listen	1
to	1
my	1
tale	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
abandon	1
or	1
commiserate	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
that	1
I	1
deserve	1
But	1
hear	1
me	1
The	1
guilty	1
are	1
allowed	1
by	1
human	1
laws	1
bloody	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
defence	1
before	1
they	1
are	1
condemned	1
Listen	1
to	1
me	1
Frankenstein	1
You	1
accuse	1
me	1
of	1
murder	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
would	1
with	1
a	1
satisfied	1
conscience	1
destroy	1
your	1
own	1
creature	1
Oh	1
praise	1
the	1
eternal	1
justice	1
of	1
man	1
Yet	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
spare	1
me	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
your	1
hands	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
to	1
my	1
remembrance	1
I	1
rejoined	1
circumstances	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
shudder	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
miserable	1
origin	1
and	1
author	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
abhorred	1
devil	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
first	1
saw	1
light	1
Cursed	1
although	1
I	1
curse	1
myself	1
be	1
the	1
hands	1
that	1
formed	1
you	1
You	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
wretched	1
beyond	1
expression	1
You	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
consider	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
just	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
not	1
Begone	1
Relieve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
detested	1
form	1
Thus	1
I	1
relieve	1
thee	1
my	1
creator	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
hated	1
hands	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
which	1
I	1
flung	1
from	1
me	1
with	1
violence	1
thus	1
I	1
take	1
from	1
thee	1
a	1
sight	1
which	1
you	1
abhor	1
Still	1
thou	1
canst	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
grant	1
me	1
thy	1
compassion	1
By	1
the	1
virtues	1
that	1
I	1
once	1
possessed	1
I	1
demand	1
this	1
from	1
you	1
Hear	1
my	1
tale	1
it	1
is	1
long	1
and	1
strange	1
and	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
fitting	1
to	1
your	1
fine	1
sensations	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
upon	1
the	1
mountain	1
The	1
sun	1
is	1
yet	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
before	1
it	1
descends	1
to	1
hide	1
itself	1
behind	1
your	1
snowy	1
precipices	1
and	1
illuminate	1
another	1
world	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
heard	1
my	1
story	1
and	1
can	1
decide	1
On	1
you	1
it	1
rests	1
whether	1
I	1
quit	1
for	1
ever	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
lead	1
a	1
harmless	1
life	1
or	1
become	1
the	1
scourge	1
of	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
and	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
speedy	1
ruin	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
ice	1
I	1
followed	1
My	1
heart	1
was	1
full	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
proceeded	1
I	1
weighed	1
the	1
various	1
arguments	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
and	1
determined	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
tale	1
I	1
was	1
partly	1
urged	1
by	1
curiosity	1
and	1
compassion	1
confirmed	1
my	1
resolution	1
I	1
had	1
hitherto	1
supposed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
I	1
eagerly	1
sought	1
a	1
confirmation	1
or	1
denial	1
of	1
this	1
opinion	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
also	1
I	1
felt	1
what	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
creator	1
towards	1
his	1
creature	1
were	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
render	1
him	1
happy	1
before	1
I	1
complained	1
of	1
his	1
wickedness	1
These	1
motives	1
urged	1
me	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
demand	1
We	1
crossed	1
the	1
ice	1
therefore	1
and	1
ascended	1
the	1
opposite	1
rock	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
descend	1
we	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
the	1
fiend	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
exultation	1
I	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
heart	1
and	1
depressed	1
spirits	1
But	1
I	1
consented	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
seating	1
myself	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
my	1
odious	1
companion	1
had	1
lighted	1
he	1
thus	1
began	1
his	1
tale	1
Chapter	1
11	1
It	1
is	1
with	1
considerable	1
difficulty	1
that	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
original	1
era	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
all	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
appear	1
confused	1
and	1
indistinct	1
A	1
strange	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
sensations	1
seized	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
felt	1
heard	1
and	1
smelt	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
I	1
learned	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
my	1
various	1
senses	1
By	1
degrees	1
I	1
remember	1
a	1
stronger	1
light	1
pressed	1
upon	1
my	1
nerves	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
Darkness	1
then	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
troubled	1
me	1
but	1
hardly	1
had	1
I	1
felt	1
this	1
when	1
by	1
opening	1
my	1
eyes	1
as	1
I	1
now	1
suppose	1
the	1
light	1
poured	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
again	1
I	1
walked	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
descended	1
but	1
I	1
presently	1
found	1
a	1
great	1
alteration	1
in	1
my	1
sensations	1
Before	1
dark	1
and	1
opaque	1
bodies	1
had	1
surrounded	1
me	1
impervious	1
to	1
my	1
touch	1
or	1
sight	1
but	1
I	1
now	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
wander	1
on	1
at	1
liberty	1
with	1
no	1
obstacles	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
either	1
surmount	1
or	1
avoid	1
The	1
light	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
oppressive	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
wearying	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
walked	1
I	1
sought	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
receive	1
shade	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
forest	1
near	1
Ingolstadt	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
lay	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
brook	1
resting	1
from	1
my	1
fatigue	1
until	1
I	1
felt	1
tormented	1
by	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
This	1
roused	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
nearly	1
dormant	1
state	1
and	1
I	1
ate	1
some	1
berries	1
which	1
I	1
found	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
trees	1
or	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
I	1
slaked	1
my	1
thirst	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
and	1
then	1
lying	1
down	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
sleep	1
It	1
was	1
dark	1
when	1
I	1
awoke	1
I	1
felt	1
cold	1
also	1
and	1
half	1
frightened	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
instinctively	1
finding	1
myself	1
so	1
desolate	1
Before	1
I	1
had	1
quitted	1
your	1
apartment	1
on	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
cold	1
I	1
had	1
covered	1
myself	1
with	1
some	1
clothes	1
but	1
these	1
were	1
insufficient	1
to	1
secure	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
dews	1
of	1
night	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
helpless	1
miserable	1
wretch	1
I	1
knew	1
and	1
could	1
distinguish	1
nothing	1
but	1
feeling	1
pain	1
invade	1
me	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
wept	1
Soon	1
a	1
gentle	1
light	1
stole	1
over	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
pleasure	1
I	1
started	1
up	1
and	1
beheld	1
a	1
radiant	1
form	1
rise	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
The	1
moon	1
I	1
gazed	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
wonder	1
It	1
moved	1
slowly	1
but	1
it	1
enlightened	1
my	1
path	1
and	1
I	1
again	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
berries	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
cold	1
when	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
huge	1
cloak	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
covered	1
myself	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
No	1
distinct	1
ideas	1
occupied	1
my	1
mind	1
all	1
was	1
confused	1
I	1
felt	1
light	1
and	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
and	1
darkness	1
innumerable	1
sounds	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
various	1
scents	1
saluted	1
me	1
the	1
only	1
object	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
distinguish	1
was	1
the	1
bright	1
moon	1
and	1
I	1
fixed	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
that	1
with	1
pleasure	1
Several	1
changes	1
of	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
orb	1
of	1
night	1
had	1
greatly	1
lessened	1
when	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
distinguish	1
my	1
sensations	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
I	1
gradually	1
saw	1
plainly	1
the	1
clear	1
stream	1
that	1
supplied	1
me	1
with	1
drink	1
and	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
shaded	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
foliage	1
I	1
was	1
delighted	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
discovered	1
that	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sound	1
which	1
often	1
saluted	1
my	1
ears	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
throats	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
winged	1
animals	1
who	1
had	1
often	1
intercepted	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
I	1
began	1
also	1
to	1
observe	1
with	1
greater	1
accuracy	1
the	1
forms	1
that	1
surrounded	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
perceive	1
the	1
boundaries	1
of	1
the	1
radiant	1
roof	1
of	1
light	1
which	1
canopied	1
me	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
imitate	1
the	1
pleasant	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
sensations	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mode	1
but	1
the	1
uncouth	1
and	1
inarticulate	1
sounds	1
which	1
broke	1
from	1
me	1
frightened	1
me	1
into	1
silence	1
again	1
The	1
moon	1
had	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
lessened	1
form	1
showed	1
itself	1
while	1
I	1
still	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
My	1
sensations	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
become	1
distinct	1
and	1
my	1
mind	1
received	1
every	1
day	1
additional	1
ideas	1
My	1
eyes	1
became	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
to	1
perceive	1
objects	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
forms	1
I	1
distinguished	1
the	1
insect	1
from	1
the	1
herb	1
and	1
by	1
degrees	1
one	1
herb	1
from	1
another	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
sparrow	1
uttered	1
none	1
but	1
harsh	1
notes	1
whilst	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
blackbird	1
and	1
thrush	1
were	1
sweet	1
and	1
enticing	1
One	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
cold	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
fire	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
by	1
some	1
wandering	1
beggars	1
and	1
was	1
overcome	1
with	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
warmth	1
I	1
experienced	1
from	1
it	1
In	1
my	1
joy	1
I	1
thrust	1
my	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
live	1
embers	1
but	1
quickly	1
drew	1
it	1
out	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
pain	1
How	1
strange	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
should	1
produce	1
such	1
opposite	1
effects	1
I	1
examined	1
the	1
materials	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
joy	1
found	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
composed	1
of	1
wood	1
I	1
quickly	1
collected	1
some	1
branches	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
wet	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
burn	1
I	1
was	1
pained	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
sat	1
still	1
watching	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
The	1
wet	1
wood	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
placed	1
near	1
the	1
heat	1
dried	1
and	1
itself	1
became	1
inflamed	1
I	1
reflected	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
by	1
touching	1
the	1
various	1
branches	1
I	1
discovered	1
the	1
cause	1
and	1
busied	1
myself	1
in	1
collecting	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
wood	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
dry	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
plentiful	1
supply	1
of	1
fire	1
When	1
night	1
came	1
on	1
and	1
brought	1
sleep	1
with	1
it	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
fear	1
lest	1
my	1
fire	1
should	1
be	1
extinguished	1
I	1
covered	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
dry	1
wood	1
and	1
leaves	1
and	1
placed	1
wet	1
branches	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
spreading	1
my	1
cloak	1
I	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
sleep	1
It	1
was	1
morning	1
when	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
my	1
first	1
care	1
was	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
fire	1
I	1
uncovered	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
quickly	1
fanned	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
flame	1
I	1
observed	1
this	1
also	1
and	1
contrived	1
a	1
fan	1
of	1
branches	1
which	1
roused	1
the	1
embers	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
nearly	1
extinguished	1
When	1
night	1
came	1
again	1
I	1
found	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
gave	1
light	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
heat	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
this	1
element	1
was	1
useful	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
food	1
for	1
I	1
found	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
offals	1
that	1
the	1
travellers	1
had	1
left	1
had	1
been	1
roasted	1
and	1
tasted	1
much	1
more	1
savoury	1
than	1
the	1
berries	1
I	1
gathered	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
I	1
tried	1
therefore	1
to	1
dress	1
my	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
placing	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
live	1
embers	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
berries	1
were	1
spoiled	1
by	1
this	1
operation	1
and	1
the	1
nuts	1
and	1
roots	1
much	1
improved	1
Food	1
however	1
became	1
scarce	1
and	1
I	1
often	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
searching	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
acorns	1
to	1
assuage	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
hunger	1
When	1
I	1
found	1
this	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
hitherto	1
inhabited	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
one	1
where	1
the	1
few	1
wants	1
I	1
experienced	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
easily	1
satisfied	1
In	1
this	1
emigration	1
I	1
exceedingly	1
lamented	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
obtained	1
through	1
accident	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
reproduce	1
it	1
I	1
gave	1
several	1
hours	1
to	1
the	1
serious	1
consideration	1
of	1
this	1
difficulty	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
relinquish	1
all	1
attempt	1
to	1
supply	1
it	1
and	1
wrapping	1
myself	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
cloak	1
I	1
struck	1
across	1
the	1
wood	1
towards	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
I	1
passed	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
these	1
rambles	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
discovered	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
A	1
great	1
fall	1
of	1
snow	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
uniform	1
white	1
the	1
appearance	1
was	1
disconsolate	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
feet	1
chilled	1
by	1
the	1
cold	1
damp	1
substance	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
ground	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
obtain	1
food	1
and	1
shelter	1
at	1
length	1
I	1
perceived	1
a	1
small	1
hut	1
on	1
a	1
rising	1
ground	1
which	1
had	1
doubtless	1
been	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
some	1
shepherd	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
sight	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
examined	1
the	1
structure	1
with	1
great	1
curiosity	1
Finding	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
I	1
entered	1
An	1
old	1
man	1
sat	1
in	1
it	1
near	1
a	1
fire	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
his	1
breakfast	1
He	1
turned	1
on	1
hearing	1
a	1
noise	1
and	1
perceiving	1
me	1
shrieked	1
loudly	1
and	1
quitting	1
the	1
hut	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
a	1
speed	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
debilitated	1
form	1
hardly	1
appeared	1
capable	1
His	1
appearance	1
different	1
from	1
any	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
seen	1
and	1
his	1
flight	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
me	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
enchanted	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
here	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
rain	1
could	1
not	1
penetrate	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
it	1
presented	1
to	1
me	1
then	1
as	1
exquisite	1
and	1
divine	1
a	1
retreat	1
as	1
Pandaemonium	1
appeared	1
to	1
the	1
daemons	1
of	1
hell	1
after	1
their	1
sufferings	1
in	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
I	1
greedily	1
devoured	1
the	1
remnants	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
s	1
breakfast	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
bread	1
cheese	1
milk	1
and	1
wine	1
the	1
latter	1
however	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
Then	1
overcome	1
by	1
fatigue	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
among	1
some	1
straw	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
It	1
was	1
noon	1
when	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
allured	1
by	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
which	1
shone	1
brightly	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
ground	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
recommence	1
my	1
travels	1
and	1
depositing	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
breakfast	1
in	1
a	1
wallet	1
I	1
found	1
I	1
proceeded	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
until	1
at	1
sunset	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
village	1
How	1
miraculous	1
did	1
this	1
appear	1
The	1
huts	1
the	1
neater	1
cottages	1
and	1
stately	1
houses	1
engaged	1
my	1
admiration	1
by	1
turns	1
The	1
vegetables	1
in	1
the	1
gardens	1
the	1
milk	1
and	1
cheese	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
cottages	1
allured	1
my	1
appetite	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
these	1
I	1
entered	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
hardly	1
placed	1
my	1
foot	1
within	1
the	1
door	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
shrieked	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
fainted	1
The	1
whole	1
village	1
was	1
roused	1
some	1
fled	1
some	1
attacked	1
me	1
until	1
grievously	1
bruised	1
by	1
stones	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
kinds	1
of	1
missile	1
weapons	1
I	1
escaped	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
and	1
fearfully	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
hovel	1
quite	1
bare	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
wretched	1
appearance	1
after	1
the	1
palaces	1
I	1
had	1
beheld	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
This	1
hovel	1
however	1
joined	1
a	1
cottage	1
of	1
a	1
neat	1
and	1
pleasant	1
appearance	1
but	1
after	1
my	1
late	1
dearly	1
bought	1
experience	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
enter	1
it	1
My	1
place	1
of	1
refuge	1
was	1
constructed	1
of	1
wood	1
but	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
with	1
difficulty	1
sit	1
upright	1
in	1
it	1
No	1
wood	1
however	1
was	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
floor	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
wind	1
entered	1
it	1
by	1
innumerable	1
chinks	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
an	1
agreeable	1
asylum	1
from	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
rain	1
Here	1
then	1
I	1
retreated	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
shelter	1
however	1
miserable	1
from	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
the	1
season	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
the	1
barbarity	1
of	1
man	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
morning	1
dawned	1
I	1
crept	1
from	1
my	1
kennel	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
view	1
the	1
adjacent	1
cottage	1
and	1
discover	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
habitation	1
I	1
had	1
found	1
It	1
was	1
situated	1
against	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
surrounded	1
on	1
the	1
sides	1
which	1
were	1
exposed	1
by	1
a	1
pig	1
sty	1
and	1
a	1
clear	1
pool	1
of	1
water	1
One	1
part	1
was	1
open	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
crept	1
in	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
covered	1
every	1
crevice	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
perceived	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
wood	1
yet	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
move	1
them	1
on	1
occasion	1
to	1
pass	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
light	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
sty	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
sufficient	1
for	1
me	1
Having	1
thus	1
arranged	1
my	1
dwelling	1
and	1
carpeted	1
it	1
with	1
clean	1
straw	1
I	1
retired	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
I	1
remembered	1
too	1
well	1
my	1
treatment	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
to	1
trust	1
myself	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
however	1
provided	1
for	1
my	1
sustenance	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
by	1
a	1
loaf	1
of	1
coarse	1
bread	1
which	1
I	1
purloined	1
and	1
a	1
cup	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
drink	1
more	1
conveniently	1
than	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
pure	1
water	1
which	1
flowed	1
by	1
my	1
retreat	1
The	1
floor	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
raised	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
kept	1
perfectly	1
dry	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
vicinity	1
to	1
the	1
chimney	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
it	1
was	1
tolerably	1
warm	1
Being	1
thus	1
provided	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
reside	1
in	1
this	1
hovel	1
until	1
something	1
should	1
occur	1
which	1
might	1
alter	1
my	1
determination	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
paradise	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
bleak	1
forest	1
my	1
former	1
residence	1
the	1
rain	1
dropping	1
branches	1
and	1
dank	1
earth	1
I	1
ate	1
my	1
breakfast	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
remove	1
a	1
plank	1
to	1
procure	1
myself	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
step	1
and	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
small	1
chink	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
young	1
creature	1
with	1
a	1
pail	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
passing	1
before	1
my	1
hovel	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
of	1
gentle	1
demeanour	1
unlike	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
since	1
found	1
cottagers	1
and	1
farmhouse	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
Yet	1
she	1
was	1
meanly	1
dressed	1
a	1
coarse	1
blue	1
petticoat	1
and	1
a	1
linen	1
jacket	1
being	1
her	1
only	1
garb	1
her	1
fair	1
hair	1
was	1
plaited	1
but	1
not	1
adorned	1
she	1
looked	1
patient	1
yet	1
sad	1
I	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
she	1
returned	1
bearing	1
the	1
pail	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
partly	1
filled	1
with	1
milk	1
As	1
she	1
walked	1
along	1
seemingly	1
incommoded	1
by	1
the	1
burden	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
met	1
her	1
whose	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
a	1
deeper	1
despondence	1
Uttering	1
a	1
few	1
sounds	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
melancholy	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
pail	1
from	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
bore	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
himself	1
She	1
followed	1
and	1
they	1
disappeared	1
Presently	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
again	1
with	1
some	1
tools	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
cross	1
the	1
field	1
behind	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
also	1
busied	1
sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
On	1
examining	1
my	1
dwelling	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
had	1
formerly	1
occupied	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
panes	1
had	1
been	1
filled	1
up	1
with	1
wood	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
almost	1
imperceptible	1
chink	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
eye	1
could	1
just	1
penetrate	1
Through	1
this	1
crevice	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
was	1
visible	1
whitewashed	1
and	1
clean	1
but	1
very	1
bare	1
of	1
furniture	1
In	1
one	1
corner	1
near	1
a	1
small	1
fire	1
sat	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
a	1
disconsolate	1
attitude	1
The	1
young	1
girl	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
arranging	1
the	1
cottage	1
but	1
presently	1
she	1
took	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
drawer	1
which	1
employed	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
taking	1
up	1
an	1
instrument	1
began	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
to	1
produce	1
sounds	1
sweeter	1
than	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
thrush	1
or	1
the	1
nightingale	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
sight	1
even	1
to	1
me	1
poor	1
wretch	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
beheld	1
aught	1
beautiful	1
before	1
The	1
silver	1
hair	1
and	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
aged	1
cottager	1
won	1
my	1
reverence	1
while	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
girl	1
enticed	1
my	1
love	1
He	1
played	1
a	1
sweet	1
mournful	1
air	1
which	1
I	1
perceived	1
drew	1
tears	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
amiable	1
companion	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
until	1
she	1
sobbed	1
audibly	1
he	1
then	1
pronounced	1
a	1
few	1
sounds	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
creature	1
leaving	1
her	1
work	1
knelt	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
He	1
raised	1
her	1
and	1
smiled	1
with	1
such	1
kindness	1
and	1
affection	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
sensations	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
overpowering	1
nature	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
pleasure	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
experienced	1
either	1
from	1
hunger	1
or	1
cold	1
warmth	1
or	1
food	1
and	1
I	1
withdrew	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
these	1
emotions	1
Soon	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
returned	1
bearing	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wood	1
The	1
girl	1
met	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
helped	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
burden	1
and	1
taking	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
fuel	1
into	1
the	1
cottage	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
fire	1
then	1
she	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
went	1
apart	1
into	1
a	1
nook	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
her	1
a	1
large	1
loaf	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cheese	1
She	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
for	1
some	1
roots	1
and	1
plants	1
which	1
she	1
placed	1
in	1
water	1
and	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
fire	1
She	1
afterwards	1
continued	1
her	1
work	1
whilst	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
appeared	1
busily	1
employed	1
in	1
digging	1
and	1
pulling	1
up	1
roots	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
employed	1
thus	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
joined	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
cottage	1
together	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
been	1
pensive	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
air	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
The	1
meal	1
was	1
quickly	1
dispatched	1
The	1
young	1
woman	1
was	1
again	1
occupied	1
in	1
arranging	1
the	1
cottage	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
walked	1
before	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
youth	1
Nothing	1
could	1
exceed	1
in	1
beauty	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
excellent	1
creatures	1
One	1
was	1
old	1
with	1
silver	1
hairs	1
and	1
a	1
countenance	1
beaming	1
with	1
benevolence	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
younger	1
was	1
slight	1
and	1
graceful	1
in	1
his	1
figure	1
and	1
his	1
features	1
were	1
moulded	1
with	1
the	1
finest	1
symmetry	1
yet	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
attitude	1
expressed	1
the	1
utmost	1
sadness	1
and	1
despondency	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
with	1
tools	1
different	1
from	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
directed	1
his	1
steps	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
Night	1
quickly	1
shut	1
in	1
but	1
to	1
my	1
extreme	1
wonder	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
cottagers	1
had	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
prolonging	1
light	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
tapers	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
I	1
experienced	1
in	1
watching	1
my	1
human	1
neighbours	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
and	1
her	1
companion	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
various	1
occupations	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
again	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
instrument	1
which	1
produced	1
the	1
divine	1
sounds	1
that	1
had	1
enchanted	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
So	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
youth	1
began	1
not	1
to	1
play	1
but	1
to	1
utter	1
sounds	1
that	1
were	1
monotonous	1
and	1
neither	1
resembling	1
the	1
harmony	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
instrument	1
nor	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
I	1
since	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
read	1
aloud	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
words	1
or	1
letters	1
The	1
family	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
thus	1
occupied	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
extinguished	1
their	1
lights	1
and	1
retired	1
as	1
I	1
conjectured	1
to	1
rest	1
Chapter	1
12	1
I	1
lay	1
on	1
my	1
straw	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
What	1
chiefly	1
struck	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
and	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
I	1
remembered	1
too	1
well	1
the	1
treatment	1
I	1
had	1
suffered	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
from	1
the	1
barbarous	1
villagers	1
and	1
resolved	1
whatever	1
course	1
of	1
conduct	1
I	1
might	1
hereafter	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
pursue	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
would	1
remain	1
quietly	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
watching	1
and	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
motives	1
which	1
influenced	1
their	1
actions	1
The	1
cottagers	1
arose	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
The	1
young	1
woman	1
arranged	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
prepared	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
departed	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
meal	1
This	1
day	1
was	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
routine	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
preceded	1
it	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
constantly	1
employed	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
various	1
laborious	1
occupations	1
within	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
soon	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
blind	1
employed	1
his	1
leisure	1
hours	1
on	1
his	1
instrument	1
or	1
in	1
contemplation	1
Nothing	1
could	1
exceed	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
the	1
younger	1
cottagers	1
exhibited	1
towards	1
their	1
venerable	1
companion	1
They	1
performed	1
towards	1
him	1
every	1
little	1
office	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
duty	1
with	1
gentleness	1
and	1
he	1
rewarded	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
benevolent	1
smiles	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
entirely	1
happy	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
often	1
went	1
apart	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
weep	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
their	1
unhappiness	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
deeply	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
If	1
such	1
lovely	1
creatures	1
were	1
miserable	1
it	1
was	1
less	1
strange	1
that	1
I	1
an	1
imperfect	1
and	1
solitary	1
being	1
should	1
be	1
wretched	1
Yet	1
why	1
were	1
these	1
gentle	1
beings	1
unhappy	1
They	1
possessed	1
a	1
delightful	1
house	1
for	1
such	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
every	1
luxury	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
fire	1
to	1
warm	1
them	1
when	1
chill	1
and	1
delicious	1
viands	1
when	1
hungry	1
they	1
were	1
dressed	1
in	1
excellent	1
clothes	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
one	1
another	1
s	1
company	1
and	1
speech	1
interchanging	1
each	1
day	1
looks	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
kindness	1
What	1
did	1
their	1
tears	1
imply	1
Did	1
they	1
really	1
express	1
pain	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
unable	1
to	1
solve	1
these	1
questions	1
but	1
perpetual	1
attention	1
and	1
time	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
many	1
appearances	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
enigmatic	1
A	1
considerable	1
period	1
elapsed	1
before	1
I	1
discovered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
this	1
amiable	1
family	1
it	1
was	1
poverty	1
and	1
they	1
suffered	1
that	1
evil	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
distressing	1
degree	1
Their	1
nourishment	1
consisted	1
entirely	1
of	1
the	1
vegetables	1
of	1
their	1
garden	1
and	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
one	1
cow	1
which	1
gave	1
very	1
little	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
when	1
its	1
masters	1
could	1
scarcely	1
procure	1
food	1
to	1
support	1
it	1
They	1
often	1
I	1
believe	1
suffered	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
hunger	1
very	1
poignantly	1
especially	1
the	1
two	1
younger	1
cottagers	1
for	1
several	1
times	1
they	1
placed	1
food	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
when	1
they	1
reserved	1
none	1
for	1
themselves	1
This	1
trait	1
of	1
kindness	1
moved	1
me	1
sensibly	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
steal	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
store	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
consumption	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
I	1
inflicted	1
pain	1
on	1
the	1
cottagers	1
I	1
abstained	1
and	1
satisfied	1
myself	1
with	1
berries	1
nuts	1
and	1
roots	1
which	1
I	1
gathered	1
from	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
wood	1
I	1
discovered	1
also	1
another	1
means	1
through	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
enabled	1
to	1
assist	1
their	1
labours	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
youth	1
spent	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
each	1
day	1
in	1
collecting	1
wood	1
for	1
the	1
family	1
fire	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
often	1
took	1
his	1
tools	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
quickly	1
discovered	1
and	1
brought	1
home	1
firing	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
consumption	1
of	1
several	1
days	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
this	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
appeared	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
on	1
seeing	1
a	1
great	1
pile	1
of	1
wood	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
She	1
uttered	1
some	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
joined	1
her	1
who	1
also	1
expressed	1
surprise	1
I	1
observed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
day	1
but	1
spent	1
it	1
in	1
repairing	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
cultivating	1
the	1
garden	1
By	1
degrees	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
discovery	1
of	1
still	1
greater	1
moment	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
these	1
people	1
possessed	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
communicating	1
their	1
experience	1
and	1
feelings	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
by	1
articulate	1
sounds	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
they	1
spoke	1
sometimes	1
produced	1
pleasure	1
or	1
pain	1
smiles	1
or	1
sadness	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
countenances	1
of	1
the	1
hearers	1
This	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
godlike	1
science	1
and	1
I	1
ardently	1
desired	1
to	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
baffled	1
in	1
every	1
attempt	1
I	1
made	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
Their	1
pronunciation	1
was	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
they	1
uttered	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
apparent	1
connection	1
with	1
visible	1
objects	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
discover	1
any	1
clue	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
unravel	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
their	1
reference	1
By	1
great	1
application	1
however	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
remained	1
during	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
several	1
revolutions	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
I	1
discovered	1
the	1
names	1
that	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
familiar	1
objects	1
of	1
discourse	1
I	1
learned	1
and	1
applied	1
the	1
words	1
fire	1
milk	1
bread	1
	1
and	1
wood	1
	1
I	1
learned	1
also	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
themselves	1
The	1
youth	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
had	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
several	1
names	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
which	1
was	1
father	1
	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
called	1
sister	1
or	1
Agatha	1
	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
Felix	1
brother	1
	1
or	1
son	1
I	1
cannot	1
describe	1
the	1
delight	1
I	1
felt	1
when	1
I	1
learned	1
the	1
ideas	1
appropriated	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
sounds	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
pronounce	1
them	1
I	1
distinguished	1
several	1
other	1
words	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
as	1
yet	1
to	1
understand	1
or	1
apply	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
good	1
dearest	1
unhappy	1
	1
I	1
spent	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
The	1
gentle	1
manners	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
greatly	1
endeared	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
unhappy	1
I	1
felt	1
depressed	1
when	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
I	1
sympathised	1
in	1
their	1
joys	1
I	1
saw	1
few	1
human	1
beings	1
besides	1
them	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
happened	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
cottage	1
their	1
harsh	1
manners	1
and	1
rude	1
gait	1
only	1
enhanced	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
superior	1
accomplishments	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
I	1
could	1
perceive	1
often	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
encourage	1
his	1
children	1
as	1
sometimes	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
melancholy	1
He	1
would	1
talk	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
accent	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
goodness	1
that	1
bestowed	1
pleasure	1
even	1
upon	1
me	1
Agatha	1
listened	1
with	1
respect	1
her	1
eyes	1
sometimes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
which	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
wipe	1
away	1
unperceived	1
but	1
I	1
generally	1
found	1
that	1
her	1
countenance	1
and	1
tone	1
were	1
more	1
cheerful	1
after	1
having	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
exhortations	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
thus	1
with	1
Felix	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
saddest	1
of	1
the	1
group	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
my	1
unpractised	1
senses	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
suffered	1
more	1
deeply	1
than	1
his	1
friends	1
But	1
if	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
more	1
sorrowful	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
more	1
cheerful	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
I	1
could	1
mention	1
innumerable	1
instances	1
which	1
although	1
slight	1
marked	1
the	1
dispositions	1
of	1
these	1
amiable	1
cottagers	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
poverty	1
and	1
want	1
Felix	1
carried	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
the	1
first	1
little	1
white	1
flower	1
that	1
peeped	1
out	1
from	1
beneath	1
the	1
snowy	1
ground	1
Early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
risen	1
he	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
snow	1
that	1
obstructed	1
her	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
milk	1
house	1
drew	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
wood	1
from	1
the	1
outhouse	1
where	1
to	1
his	1
perpetual	1
astonishment	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
store	1
always	1
replenished	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
worked	1
sometimes	1
for	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
farmer	1
because	1
he	1
often	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
until	1
dinner	1
yet	1
brought	1
no	1
wood	1
with	1
him	1
At	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
worked	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
frosty	1
season	1
he	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
Agatha	1
This	1
reading	1
had	1
puzzled	1
me	1
extremely	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
by	1
degrees	1
I	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
uttered	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sounds	1
when	1
he	1
read	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
I	1
conjectured	1
therefore	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
paper	1
signs	1
for	1
speech	1
which	1
he	1
understood	1
and	1
I	1
ardently	1
longed	1
to	1
comprehend	1
these	1
also	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
that	1
possible	1
when	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
understand	1
the	1
sounds	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
stood	1
as	1
signs	1
I	1
improved	1
however	1
sensibly	1
in	1
this	1
science	1
but	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
follow	1
up	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
conversation	1
although	1
I	1
applied	1
my	1
whole	1
mind	1
to	1
the	1
endeavour	1
for	1
I	1
easily	1
perceived	1
that	1
although	1
I	1
eagerly	1
longed	1
to	1
discover	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
cottagers	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
attempt	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
become	1
master	1
of	1
their	1
language	1
which	1
knowledge	1
might	1
enable	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
overlook	1
the	1
deformity	1
of	1
my	1
figure	1
for	1
with	1
this	1
also	1
the	1
contrast	1
perpetually	1
presented	1
to	1
my	1
eyes	1
had	1
made	1
me	1
acquainted	1
I	1
had	1
admired	1
the	1
perfect	1
forms	1
of	1
my	1
cottagers	1
their	1
grace	1
beauty	1
and	1
delicate	1
complexions	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
I	1
terrified	1
when	1
I	1
viewed	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
transparent	1
pool	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
started	1
back	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
I	1
who	1
was	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
became	1
fully	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
the	1
monster	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
bitterest	1
sensations	1
of	1
despondence	1
and	1
mortification	1
Alas	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
entirely	1
know	1
the	1
fatal	1
effects	1
of	1
this	1
miserable	1
deformity	1
As	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
warmer	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
longer	1
the	1
snow	1
vanished	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
bare	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
earth	1
From	1
this	1
time	1
Felix	1
was	1
more	1
employed	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
moving	1
indications	1
of	1
impending	1
famine	1
disappeared	1
Their	1
food	1
as	1
I	1
afterwards	1
found	1
was	1
coarse	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
wholesome	1
and	1
they	1
procured	1
a	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
it	1
Several	1
new	1
kinds	1
of	1
plants	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
which	1
they	1
dressed	1
and	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
comfort	1
increased	1
daily	1
as	1
the	1
season	1
advanced	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
son	1
walked	1
each	1
day	1
at	1
noon	1
when	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
rain	1
as	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
when	1
the	1
heavens	1
poured	1
forth	1
its	1
waters	1
This	1
frequently	1
took	1
place	1
but	1
a	1
high	1
wind	1
quickly	1
dried	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
season	1
became	1
far	1
more	1
pleasant	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
My	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
was	1
uniform	1
During	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
attended	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
dispersed	1
in	1
various	1
occupations	1
I	1
slept	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
observing	1
my	1
friends	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
rest	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
moon	1
or	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
star	1
light	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
collected	1
my	1
own	1
food	1
and	1
fuel	1
for	1
the	1
cottage	1
When	1
I	1
returned	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
I	1
cleared	1
their	1
path	1
from	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
performed	1
those	1
offices	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
done	1
by	1
Felix	1
I	1
afterwards	1
found	1
that	1
these	1
labours	1
performed	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
them	1
and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
on	1
these	1
occasions	1
utter	1
the	1
words	1
good	1
spirit	1
wonderful	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
understand	1
the	1
signification	1
of	1
these	1
terms	1
My	1
thoughts	1
now	1
became	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
motives	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
these	1
lovely	1
creatures	1
I	1
was	1
inquisitive	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
Felix	1
appeared	1
so	1
miserable	1
and	1
Agatha	1
so	1
sad	1
I	1
thought	1
foolish	1
wretch	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
restore	1
happiness	1
to	1
these	1
deserving	1
people	1
When	1
I	1
slept	1
or	1
was	1
absent	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
venerable	1
blind	1
father	1
the	1
gentle	1
Agatha	1
and	1
the	1
excellent	1
Felix	1
flitted	1
before	1
me	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
superior	1
beings	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
arbiters	1
of	1
my	1
future	1
destiny	1
I	1
formed	1
in	1
my	1
imagination	1
a	1
thousand	1
pictures	1
of	1
presenting	1
myself	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
reception	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
imagined	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
disgusted	1
until	1
by	1
my	1
gentle	1
demeanour	1
and	1
conciliating	1
words	1
I	1
should	1
first	1
win	1
their	1
favour	1
and	1
afterwards	1
their	1
love	1
These	1
thoughts	1
exhilarated	1
me	1
and	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
apply	1
with	1
fresh	1
ardour	1
to	1
the	1
acquiring	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
language	1
My	1
organs	1
were	1
indeed	1
harsh	1
but	1
supple	1
and	1
although	1
my	1
voice	1
was	1
very	1
unlike	1
the	1
soft	1
music	1
of	1
their	1
tones	1
yet	1
I	1
pronounced	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
I	1
understood	1
with	1
tolerable	1
ease	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
ass	1
and	1
the	1
lap	1
dog	1
yet	1
surely	1
the	1
gentle	1
ass	1
whose	1
intentions	1
were	1
affectionate	1
although	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
rude	1
deserved	1
better	1
treatment	1
than	1
blows	1
and	1
execration	1
The	1
pleasant	1
showers	1
and	1
genial	1
warmth	1
of	1
spring	1
greatly	1
altered	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
Men	1
who	1
before	1
this	1
change	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
hid	1
in	1
caves	1
dispersed	1
themselves	1
and	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
various	1
arts	1
of	1
cultivation	1
The	1
birds	1
sang	1
in	1
more	1
cheerful	1
notes	1
and	1
the	1
leaves	1
began	1
to	1
bud	1
forth	1
on	1
the	1
trees	1
Happy	1
happy	1
earth	1
Fit	1
habitation	1
for	1
gods	1
which	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
before	1
was	1
bleak	1
damp	1
and	1
unwholesome	1
My	1
spirits	1
were	1
elevated	1
by	1
the	1
enchanting	1
appearance	1
of	1
nature	1
the	1
past	1
was	1
blotted	1
from	1
my	1
memory	1
the	1
present	1
was	1
tranquil	1
and	1
the	1
future	1
gilded	1
by	1
bright	1
rays	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
anticipations	1
of	1
joy	1
Chapter	1
13	1
I	1
now	1
hasten	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
moving	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
I	1
shall	1
relate	1
events	1
that	1
impressed	1
me	1
with	1
feelings	1
which	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
Spring	1
advanced	1
rapidly	1
the	1
weather	1
became	1
fine	1
and	1
the	1
skies	1
cloudless	1
It	1
surprised	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
before	1
was	1
desert	1
and	1
gloomy	1
should	1
now	1
bloom	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
flowers	1
and	1
verdure	1
My	1
senses	1
were	1
gratified	1
and	1
refreshed	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
scents	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
sights	1
of	1
beauty	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
when	1
my	1
cottagers	1
periodically	1
rested	1
from	1
labour	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
played	1
on	1
his	1
guitar	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
observed	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
Felix	1
was	1
melancholy	1
beyond	1
expression	1
he	1
sighed	1
frequently	1
and	1
once	1
his	1
father	1
paused	1
in	1
his	1
music	1
and	1
I	1
conjectured	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
inquired	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
s	1
sorrow	1
Felix	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
accent	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
recommencing	1
his	1
music	1
when	1
someone	1
tapped	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
lady	1
on	1
horseback	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
country	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
guide	1
The	1
lady	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
suit	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
thick	1
black	1
veil	1
Agatha	1
asked	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
only	1
replied	1
by	1
pronouncing	1
in	1
a	1
sweet	1
accent	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Felix	1
Her	1
voice	1
was	1
musical	1
but	1
unlike	1
that	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
word	1
Felix	1
came	1
up	1
hastily	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
threw	1
up	1
her	1
veil	1
and	1
I	1
beheld	1
a	1
countenance	1
of	1
angelic	1
beauty	1
and	1
expression	1
Her	1
hair	1
of	1
a	1
shining	1
raven	1
black	1
and	1
curiously	1
braided	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
dark	1
but	1
gentle	1
although	1
animated	1
her	1
features	1
of	1
a	1
regular	1
proportion	1
and	1
her	1
complexion	1
wondrously	1
fair	1
each	1
cheek	1
tinged	1
with	1
a	1
lovely	1
pink	1
Felix	1
seemed	1
ravished	1
with	1
delight	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
every	1
trait	1
of	1
sorrow	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
instantly	1
expressed	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
ecstatic	1
joy	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
believed	1
it	1
capable	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
as	1
his	1
cheek	1
flushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
thought	1
him	1
as	1
beautiful	1
as	1
the	1
stranger	1
She	1
appeared	1
affected	1
by	1
different	1
feelings	1
wiping	1
a	1
few	1
tears	1
from	1
her	1
lovely	1
eyes	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
Felix	1
who	1
kissed	1
it	1
rapturously	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
distinguish	1
his	1
sweet	1
Arabian	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
understand	1
him	1
but	1
smiled	1
He	1
assisted	1
her	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
dismissing	1
her	1
guide	1
conducted	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
cottage	1
Some	1
conversation	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
stranger	1
knelt	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
feet	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
he	1
raised	1
her	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
affectionately	1
I	1
soon	1
perceived	1
that	1
although	1
the	1
stranger	1
uttered	1
articulate	1
sounds	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
language	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
she	1
was	1
neither	1
understood	1
by	1
nor	1
herself	1
understood	1
the	1
cottagers	1
They	1
made	1
many	1
signs	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
comprehend	1
but	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
presence	1
diffused	1
gladness	1
through	1
the	1
cottage	1
dispelling	1
their	1
sorrow	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
dissipates	1
the	1
morning	1
mists	1
Felix	1
seemed	1
peculiarly	1
happy	1
and	1
with	1
smiles	1
of	1
delight	1
welcomed	1
his	1
Arabian	1
Agatha	1
the	1
ever	1
gentle	1
Agatha	1
kissed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
lovely	1
stranger	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
made	1
signs	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sorrowful	1
until	1
she	1
came	1
Some	1
hours	1
passed	1
thus	1
while	1
they	1
by	1
their	1
countenances	1
expressed	1
joy	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
comprehend	1
Presently	1
I	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
frequent	1
recurrence	1
of	1
some	1
sound	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
repeated	1
after	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
learn	1
their	1
language	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
instantly	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
end	1
The	1
stranger	1
learned	1
about	1
twenty	1
words	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
lesson	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
indeed	1
were	1
those	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
understood	1
but	1
I	1
profited	1
by	1
the	1
others	1
As	1
night	1
came	1
on	1
Agatha	1
and	1
the	1
Arabian	1
retired	1
early	1
When	1
they	1
separated	1
Felix	1
kissed	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
said	1
Good	1
night	1
sweet	1
Safie	1
He	1
sat	1
up	1
much	1
longer	1
conversing	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
frequent	1
repetition	1
of	1
her	1
name	1
I	1
conjectured	1
that	1
their	1
lovely	1
guest	1
was	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
I	1
ardently	1
desired	1
to	1
understand	1
them	1
and	1
bent	1
every	1
faculty	1
towards	1
that	1
purpose	1
but	1
found	1
it	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
Felix	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
usual	1
occupations	1
of	1
Agatha	1
were	1
finished	1
the	1
Arabian	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
guitar	1
played	1
some	1
airs	1
so	1
entrancingly	1
beautiful	1
that	1
they	1
at	1
once	1
drew	1
tears	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
delight	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
She	1
sang	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
flowed	1
in	1
a	1
rich	1
cadence	1
swelling	1
or	1
dying	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
nightingale	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
guitar	1
to	1
Agatha	1
who	1
at	1
first	1
declined	1
it	1
She	1
played	1
a	1
simple	1
air	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
accompanied	1
it	1
in	1
sweet	1
accents	1
but	1
unlike	1
the	1
wondrous	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
appeared	1
enraptured	1
and	1
said	1
some	1
words	1
which	1
Agatha	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
Safie	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
that	1
she	1
bestowed	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
greatest	1
delight	1
by	1
her	1
music	1
The	1
days	1
now	1
passed	1
as	1
peaceably	1
as	1
before	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
alteration	1
that	1
joy	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
of	1
sadness	1
in	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
Safie	1
was	1
always	1
gay	1
and	1
happy	1
she	1
and	1
I	1
improved	1
rapidly	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
language	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
two	1
months	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
comprehend	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
uttered	1
by	1
my	1
protectors	1
In	1
the	1
meanwhile	1
also	1
the	1
black	1
ground	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
herbage	1
and	1
the	1
green	1
banks	1
interspersed	1
with	1
innumerable	1
flowers	1
sweet	1
to	1
the	1
scent	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
stars	1
of	1
pale	1
radiance	1
among	1
the	1
moonlight	1
woods	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
warmer	1
the	1
nights	1
clear	1
and	1
balmy	1
and	1
my	1
nocturnal	1
rambles	1
were	1
an	1
extreme	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
considerably	1
shortened	1
by	1
the	1
late	1
setting	1
and	1
early	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
ventured	1
abroad	1
during	1
daylight	1
fearful	1
of	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
treatment	1
I	1
had	1
formerly	1
endured	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
which	1
I	1
entered	1
My	1
days	1
were	1
spent	1
in	1
close	1
attention	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
more	1
speedily	1
master	1
the	1
language	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
boast	1
that	1
I	1
improved	1
more	1
rapidly	1
than	1
the	1
Arabian	1
who	1
understood	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
conversed	1
in	1
broken	1
accents	1
whilst	1
I	1
comprehended	1
and	1
could	1
imitate	1
almost	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
spoken	1
While	1
I	1
improved	1
in	1
speech	1
I	1
also	1
learned	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
letters	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
taught	1
to	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
this	1
opened	1
before	1
me	1
a	1
wide	1
field	1
for	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight	1
The	1
book	1
from	1
which	1
Felix	1
instructed	1
Safie	1
was	1
Volney	1
s	1
Ruins	1
of	1
Empires	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
understood	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
had	1
not	1
Felix	1
in	1
reading	1
it	1
given	1
very	1
minute	1
explanations	1
He	1
had	1
chosen	1
this	1
work	1
he	1
said	1
because	1
the	1
declamatory	1
style	1
was	1
framed	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
Eastern	1
authors	1
Through	1
this	1
work	1
I	1
obtained	1
a	1
cursory	1
knowledge	1
of	1
history	1
and	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
empires	1
at	1
present	1
existing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
an	1
insight	1
into	1
the	1
manners	1
governments	1
and	1
religions	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
slothful	1
Asiatics	1
of	1
the	1
stupendous	1
genius	1
and	1
mental	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
Grecians	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
wonderful	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
Romans	1
of	1
their	1
subsequent	1
degenerating	1
of	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
that	1
mighty	1
empire	1
of	1
chivalry	1
Christianity	1
and	1
kings	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
hemisphere	1
and	1
wept	1
with	1
Safie	1
over	1
the	1
hapless	1
fate	1
of	1
its	1
original	1
inhabitants	1
These	1
wonderful	1
narrations	1
inspired	1
me	1
with	1
strange	1
feelings	1
Was	1
man	1
indeed	1
at	1
once	1
so	1
powerful	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
magnificent	1
yet	1
so	1
vicious	1
and	1
base	1
He	1
appeared	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
a	1
mere	1
scion	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
principle	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
as	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
conceived	1
of	1
noble	1
and	1
godlike	1
To	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
virtuous	1
man	1
appeared	1
the	1
highest	1
honour	1
that	1
can	1
befall	1
a	1
sensitive	1
being	1
to	1
be	1
base	1
and	1
vicious	1
as	1
many	1
on	1
record	1
have	1
been	1
appeared	1
the	1
lowest	1
degradation	1
a	1
condition	1
more	1
abject	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
mole	1
or	1
harmless	1
worm	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
how	1
one	1
man	1
could	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
murder	1
his	1
fellow	1
or	1
even	1
why	1
there	1
were	1
laws	1
and	1
governments	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
details	1
of	1
vice	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
my	1
wonder	1
ceased	1
and	1
I	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
disgust	1
and	1
loathing	1
Every	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
now	1
opened	1
new	1
wonders	1
to	1
me	1
While	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
instructions	1
which	1
Felix	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
the	1
Arabian	1
the	1
strange	1
system	1
of	1
human	1
society	1
was	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
property	1
of	1
immense	1
wealth	1
and	1
squalid	1
poverty	1
of	1
rank	1
descent	1
and	1
noble	1
blood	1
The	1
words	1
induced	1
me	1
to	1
turn	1
towards	1
myself	1
I	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
possessions	1
most	1
esteemed	1
by	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
were	1
high	1
and	1
unsullied	1
descent	1
united	1
with	1
riches	1
A	1
man	1
might	1
be	1
respected	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
advantages	1
but	1
without	1
either	1
he	1
was	1
considered	1
except	1
in	1
very	1
rare	1
instances	1
as	1
a	1
vagabond	1
and	1
a	1
slave	1
doomed	1
to	1
waste	1
his	1
powers	1
for	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
the	1
chosen	1
few	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
Of	1
my	1
creation	1
and	1
creator	1
I	1
was	1
absolutely	1
ignorant	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
possessed	1
no	1
money	1
no	1
friends	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
property	1
I	1
was	1
besides	1
endued	1
with	1
a	1
figure	1
hideously	1
deformed	1
and	1
loathsome	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
nature	1
as	1
man	1
I	1
was	1
more	1
agile	1
than	1
they	1
and	1
could	1
subsist	1
upon	1
coarser	1
diet	1
I	1
bore	1
the	1
extremes	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
cold	1
with	1
less	1
injury	1
to	1
my	1
frame	1
my	1
stature	1
far	1
exceeded	1
theirs	1
When	1
I	1
looked	1
around	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
of	1
none	1
like	1
me	1
Was	1
I	1
then	1
a	1
monster	1
a	1
blot	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
men	1
fled	1
and	1
whom	1
all	1
men	1
disowned	1
I	1
cannot	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
agony	1
that	1
these	1
reflections	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
dispel	1
them	1
but	1
sorrow	1
only	1
increased	1
with	1
knowledge	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
for	1
ever	1
remained	1
in	1
my	1
native	1
wood	1
nor	1
known	1
nor	1
felt	1
beyond	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
heat	1
Of	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
nature	1
is	1
knowledge	1
It	1
clings	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
once	1
seized	1
on	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
lichen	1
on	1
the	1
rock	1
I	1
wished	1
sometimes	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
all	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
but	1
I	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
means	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
death	1
a	1
state	1
which	1
I	1
feared	1
yet	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
I	1
admired	1
virtue	1
and	1
good	1
feelings	1
and	1
loved	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
and	1
amiable	1
qualities	1
of	1
my	1
cottagers	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
intercourse	1
with	1
them	1
except	1
through	1
means	1
which	1
I	1
obtained	1
by	1
stealth	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
unseen	1
and	1
unknown	1
and	1
which	1
rather	1
increased	1
than	1
satisfied	1
the	1
desire	1
I	1
had	1
of	1
becoming	1
one	1
among	1
my	1
fellows	1
The	1
gentle	1
words	1
of	1
Agatha	1
and	1
the	1
animated	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
charming	1
Arabian	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
The	1
mild	1
exhortations	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
lively	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
loved	1
Felix	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
Miserable	1
unhappy	1
wretch	1
Other	1
lessons	1
were	1
impressed	1
upon	1
me	1
even	1
more	1
deeply	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
sexes	1
and	1
the	1
birth	1
and	1
growth	1
of	1
children	1
how	1
the	1
father	1
doted	1
on	1
the	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
infant	1
and	1
the	1
lively	1
sallies	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
child	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
cares	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
were	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
precious	1
charge	1
how	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
youth	1
expanded	1
and	1
gained	1
knowledge	1
of	1
brother	1
sister	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
relationships	1
which	1
bind	1
one	1
human	1
being	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
mutual	1
bonds	1
But	1
where	1
were	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
No	1
father	1
had	1
watched	1
my	1
infant	1
days	1
no	1
mother	1
had	1
blessed	1
me	1
with	1
smiles	1
and	1
caresses	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
my	1
past	1
life	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
blot	1
a	1
blind	1
vacancy	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
distinguished	1
nothing	1
From	1
my	1
earliest	1
remembrance	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
I	1
then	1
was	1
in	1
height	1
and	1
proportion	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
a	1
being	1
resembling	1
me	1
or	1
who	1
claimed	1
any	1
intercourse	1
with	1
me	1
What	1
was	1
I	1
The	1
question	1
again	1
recurred	1
to	1
be	1
answered	1
only	1
with	1
groans	1
I	1
will	1
soon	1
explain	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
feelings	1
tended	1
but	1
allow	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
cottagers	1
whose	1
story	1
excited	1
in	1
me	1
such	1
various	1
feelings	1
of	1
indignation	1
delight	1
and	1
wonder	1
but	1
which	1
all	1
terminated	1
in	1
additional	1
love	1
and	1
reverence	1
for	1
my	1
protectors	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
loved	1
in	1
an	1
innocent	1
half	1
painful	1
self	1
deceit	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
Chapter	1
14	1
Some	1
time	1
elapsed	1
before	1
I	1
learned	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
impress	1
itself	1
deeply	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
unfolding	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
circumstances	1
each	1
interesting	1
and	1
wonderful	1
to	1
one	1
so	1
utterly	1
inexperienced	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
De	1
Lacey	1
He	1
was	1
descended	1
from	1
a	1
good	1
family	1
in	1
France	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
in	1
affluence	1
respected	1
by	1
his	1
superiors	1
and	1
beloved	1
by	1
his	1
equals	1
His	1
son	1
was	1
bred	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
and	1
Agatha	1
had	1
ranked	1
with	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
distinction	1
A	1
few	1
months	1
before	1
my	1
arrival	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
luxurious	1
city	1
called	1
Paris	1
surrounded	1
by	1
friends	1
and	1
possessed	1
of	1
every	1
enjoyment	1
which	1
virtue	1
refinement	1
of	1
intellect	1
or	1
taste	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
moderate	1
fortune	1
could	1
afford	1
The	1
father	1
of	1
Safie	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
ruin	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
Turkish	1
merchant	1
and	1
had	1
inhabited	1
Paris	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
when	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
he	1
became	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
Safie	1
arrived	1
from	1
Constantinople	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
He	1
was	1
tried	1
and	1
condemned	1
to	1
death	1
The	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
sentence	1
was	1
very	1
flagrant	1
all	1
Paris	1
was	1
indignant	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
judged	1
that	1
his	1
religion	1
and	1
wealth	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
crime	1
alleged	1
against	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
condemnation	1
Felix	1
had	1
accidentally	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
trial	1
his	1
horror	1
and	1
indignation	1
were	1
uncontrollable	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
He	1
made	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
solemn	1
vow	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
looked	1
around	1
for	1
the	1
means	1
After	1
many	1
fruitless	1
attempts	1
to	1
gain	1
admittance	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
strongly	1
grated	1
window	1
in	1
an	1
unguarded	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
which	1
lighted	1
the	1
dungeon	1
of	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Muhammadan	1
who	1
loaded	1
with	1
chains	1
waited	1
in	1
despair	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
barbarous	1
sentence	1
Felix	1
visited	1
the	1
grate	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
prisoner	1
his	1
intentions	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
The	1
Turk	1
amazed	1
and	1
delighted	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
kindle	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
his	1
deliverer	1
by	1
promises	1
of	1
reward	1
and	1
wealth	1
Felix	1
rejected	1
his	1
offers	1
with	1
contempt	1
yet	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
lovely	1
Safie	1
who	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
who	1
by	1
her	1
gestures	1
expressed	1
her	1
lively	1
gratitude	1
the	1
youth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
owning	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
captive	1
possessed	1
a	1
treasure	1
which	1
would	1
fully	1
reward	1
his	1
toil	1
and	1
hazard	1
The	1
Turk	1
quickly	1
perceived	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Felix	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
secure	1
him	1
more	1
entirely	1
in	1
his	1
interests	1
by	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
marriage	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
conveyed	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
Felix	1
was	1
too	1
delicate	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
offer	1
yet	1
he	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
consummation	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
During	1
the	1
ensuing	1
days	1
while	1
the	1
preparations	1
were	1
going	1
forward	1
for	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
Felix	1
was	1
warmed	1
by	1
several	1
letters	1
that	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
this	1
lovely	1
girl	1
who	1
found	1
means	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
thoughts	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
who	1
understood	1
French	1
She	1
thanked	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
ardent	1
terms	1
for	1
his	1
intended	1
services	1
towards	1
her	1
parent	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
gently	1
deplored	1
her	1
own	1
fate	1
I	1
have	1
copies	1
of	1
these	1
letters	1
for	1
I	1
found	1
means	1
during	1
my	1
residence	1
in	1
the	1
hovel	1
to	1
procure	1
the	1
implements	1
of	1
writing	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
often	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Felix	1
or	1
Agatha	1
Before	1
I	1
depart	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
they	1
will	1
prove	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
my	1
tale	1
but	1
at	1
present	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
already	1
far	1
declined	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
repeat	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
Safie	1
related	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
Christian	1
Arab	1
seized	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
slave	1
by	1
the	1
Turks	1
recommended	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
she	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Safie	1
who	1
married	1
her	1
The	1
young	1
girl	1
spoke	1
in	1
high	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
terms	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
who	1
born	1
in	1
freedom	1
spurned	1
the	1
bondage	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
reduced	1
She	1
instructed	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
the	1
tenets	1
of	1
her	1
religion	1
and	1
taught	1
her	1
to	1
aspire	1
to	1
higher	1
powers	1
of	1
intellect	1
and	1
an	1
independence	1
of	1
spirit	1
forbidden	1
to	1
the	1
female	1
followers	1
of	1
Muhammad	1
This	1
lady	1
died	1
but	1
her	1
lessons	1
were	1
indelibly	1
impressed	1
on	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Safie	1
who	1
sickened	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
again	1
returning	1
to	1
Asia	1
and	1
being	1
immured	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
harem	1
allowed	1
only	1
to	1
occupy	1
herself	1
with	1
infantile	1
amusements	1
ill	1
suited	1
to	1
the	1
temper	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
now	1
accustomed	1
to	1
grand	1
ideas	1
and	1
a	1
noble	1
emulation	1
for	1
virtue	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
marrying	1
a	1
Christian	1
and	1
remaining	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
where	1
women	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
rank	1
in	1
society	1
was	1
enchanting	1
to	1
her	1
The	1
day	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
Turk	1
was	1
fixed	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
previous	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
quitted	1
his	1
prison	1
and	1
before	1
morning	1
was	1
distant	1
many	1
leagues	1
from	1
Paris	1
Felix	1
had	1
procured	1
passports	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
sister	1
and	1
himself	1
He	1
had	1
previously	1
communicated	1
his	1
plan	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
who	1
aided	1
the	1
deceit	1
by	1
quitting	1
his	1
house	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
a	1
journey	1
and	1
concealed	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
an	1
obscure	1
part	1
of	1
Paris	1
Felix	1
conducted	1
the	1
fugitives	1
through	1
France	1
to	1
Lyons	1
and	1
across	1
Mont	1
Cenis	1
to	1
Leghorn	1
where	1
the	1
merchant	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
wait	1
a	1
favourable	1
opportunity	1
of	1
passing	1
into	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Turkish	1
dominions	1
Safie	1
resolved	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
until	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
before	1
which	1
time	1
the	1
Turk	1
renewed	1
his	1
promise	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
united	1
to	1
his	1
deliverer	1
and	1
Felix	1
remained	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
that	1
event	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
Arabian	1
who	1
exhibited	1
towards	1
him	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
tenderest	1
affection	1
They	1
conversed	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
through	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
an	1
interpreter	1
and	1
sometimes	1
with	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
looks	1
and	1
Safie	1
sang	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
divine	1
airs	1
of	1
her	1
native	1
country	1
The	1
Turk	1
allowed	1
this	1
intimacy	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
and	1
encouraged	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
the	1
youthful	1
lovers	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
far	1
other	1
plans	1
He	1
loathed	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
should	1
be	1
united	1
to	1
a	1
Christian	1
but	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
resentment	1
of	1
Felix	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
appear	1
lukewarm	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
deliverer	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
choose	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Italian	1
state	1
which	1
they	1
inhabited	1
He	1
revolved	1
a	1
thousand	1
plans	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
enabled	1
to	1
prolong	1
the	1
deceit	1
until	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
necessary	1
and	1
secretly	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
daughter	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
departed	1
His	1
plans	1
were	1
facilitated	1
by	1
the	1
news	1
which	1
arrived	1
from	1
Paris	1
The	1
government	1
of	1
France	1
were	1
greatly	1
enraged	1
at	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
their	1
victim	1
and	1
spared	1
no	1
pains	1
to	1
detect	1
and	1
punish	1
his	1
deliverer	1
The	1
plot	1
of	1
Felix	1
was	1
quickly	1
discovered	1
and	1
De	1
Lacey	1
and	1
Agatha	1
were	1
thrown	1
into	1
prison	1
The	1
news	1
reached	1
Felix	1
and	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
dream	1
of	1
pleasure	1
His	1
blind	1
and	1
aged	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
gentle	1
sister	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
noisome	1
dungeon	1
while	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
free	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
This	1
idea	1
was	1
torture	1
to	1
him	1
He	1
quickly	1
arranged	1
with	1
the	1
Turk	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
latter	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
favourable	1
opportunity	1
for	1
escape	1
before	1
Felix	1
could	1
return	1
to	1
Italy	1
Safie	1
should	1
remain	1
as	1
a	1
boarder	1
at	1
a	1
convent	1
at	1
Leghorn	1
and	1
then	1
quitting	1
the	1
lovely	1
Arabian	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
Paris	1
and	1
delivered	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
hoping	1
to	1
free	1
De	1
Lacey	1
and	1
Agatha	1
by	1
this	1
proceeding	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
They	1
remained	1
confined	1
for	1
five	1
months	1
before	1
the	1
trial	1
took	1
place	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
deprived	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
fortune	1
and	1
condemned	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
perpetual	1
exile	1
from	1
their	1
native	1
country	1
They	1
found	1
a	1
miserable	1
asylum	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
Germany	1
where	1
I	1
discovered	1
them	1
Felix	1
soon	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
treacherous	1
Turk	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
endured	1
such	1
unheard	1
of	1
oppression	1
on	1
discovering	1
that	1
his	1
deliverer	1
was	1
thus	1
reduced	1
to	1
poverty	1
and	1
ruin	1
became	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
good	1
feeling	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
had	1
quitted	1
Italy	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
insultingly	1
sending	1
Felix	1
a	1
pittance	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
aid	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
some	1
plan	1
of	1
future	1
maintenance	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
preyed	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Felix	1
and	1
rendered	1
him	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
He	1
could	1
have	1
endured	1
poverty	1
and	1
while	1
this	1
distress	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
meed	1
of	1
his	1
virtue	1
he	1
gloried	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
ingratitude	1
of	1
the	1
Turk	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
beloved	1
Safie	1
were	1
misfortunes	1
more	1
bitter	1
and	1
irreparable	1
The	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
Arabian	1
now	1
infused	1
new	1
life	1
into	1
his	1
soul	1
When	1
the	1
news	1
reached	1
Leghorn	1
that	1
Felix	1
was	1
deprived	1
of	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
rank	1
the	1
merchant	1
commanded	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
but	1
to	1
prepare	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
native	1
country	1
The	1
generous	1
nature	1
of	1
Safie	1
was	1
outraged	1
by	1
this	1
command	1
she	1
attempted	1
to	1
expostulate	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
but	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
angrily	1
reiterating	1
his	1
tyrannical	1
mandate	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
Turk	1
entered	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
apartment	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
hastily	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
his	1
residence	1
at	1
Leghorn	1
had	1
been	1
divulged	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
speedily	1
be	1
delivered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
government	1
he	1
had	1
consequently	1
hired	1
a	1
vessel	1
to	1
convey	1
him	1
to	1
Constantinople	1
for	1
which	1
city	1
he	1
should	1
sail	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
He	1
intended	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
daughter	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
confidential	1
servant	1
to	1
follow	1
at	1
her	1
leisure	1
with	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived	1
at	1
Leghorn	1
When	1
alone	1
Safie	1
resolved	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
conduct	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
become	1
her	1
to	1
pursue	1
in	1
this	1
emergency	1
A	1
residence	1
in	1
Turkey	1
was	1
abhorrent	1
to	1
her	1
her	1
religion	1
and	1
her	1
feelings	1
were	1
alike	1
averse	1
to	1
it	1
By	1
some	1
papers	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
which	1
fell	1
into	1
her	1
hands	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
exile	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
and	1
learnt	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
then	1
resided	1
She	1
hesitated	1
some	1
time	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
formed	1
her	1
determination	1
Taking	1
with	1
her	1
some	1
jewels	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
she	1
quitted	1
Italy	1
with	1
an	1
attendant	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Leghorn	1
but	1
who	1
understood	1
the	1
common	1
language	1
of	1
Turkey	1
and	1
departed	1
for	1
Germany	1
She	1
arrived	1
in	1
safety	1
at	1
a	1
town	1
about	1
twenty	1
leagues	1
from	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
De	1
Lacey	1
when	1
her	1
attendant	1
fell	1
dangerously	1
ill	1
Safie	1
nursed	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
devoted	1
affection	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
died	1
and	1
the	1
Arabian	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
utterly	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
customs	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
She	1
fell	1
however	1
into	1
good	1
hands	1
The	1
Italian	1
had	1
mentioned	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
after	1
her	1
death	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
took	1
care	1
that	1
Safie	1
should	1
arrive	1
in	1
safety	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
cottagers	1
It	1
impressed	1
me	1
deeply	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
social	1
life	1
which	1
it	1
developed	1
to	1
admire	1
their	1
virtues	1
and	1
to	1
deprecate	1
the	1
vices	1
of	1
mankind	1
As	1
yet	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
crime	1
as	1
a	1
distant	1
evil	1
benevolence	1
and	1
generosity	1
were	1
ever	1
present	1
before	1
me	1
inciting	1
within	1
me	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
actor	1
in	1
the	1
busy	1
scene	1
where	1
so	1
many	1
admirable	1
qualities	1
were	1
called	1
forth	1
and	1
displayed	1
But	1
in	1
giving	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
my	1
intellect	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
omit	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
August	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
One	1
night	1
during	1
my	1
accustomed	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
wood	1
where	1
I	1
collected	1
my	1
own	1
food	1
and	1
brought	1
home	1
firing	1
for	1
my	1
protectors	1
I	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
a	1
leathern	1
portmanteau	1
containing	1
several	1
articles	1
of	1
dress	1
and	1
some	1
books	1
I	1
eagerly	1
seized	1
the	1
prize	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
hovel	1
Fortunately	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
acquired	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
they	1
consisted	1
of	1
Paradise	1
Lost	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
Plutarch	1
s	1
Lives	1
and	1
the	1
Sorrows	1
of	1
Werter	1
The	1
possession	1
of	1
these	1
treasures	1
gave	1
me	1
extreme	1
delight	1
I	1
now	1
continually	1
studied	1
and	1
exercised	1
my	1
mind	1
upon	1
these	1
histories	1
whilst	1
my	1
friends	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
their	1
ordinary	1
occupations	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
these	1
books	1
They	1
produced	1
in	1
me	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
new	1
images	1
and	1
feelings	1
that	1
sometimes	1
raised	1
me	1
to	1
ecstasy	1
but	1
more	1
frequently	1
sunk	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
lowest	1
dejection	1
In	1
the	1
Sorrows	1
of	1
Werter	1
besides	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
its	1
simple	1
and	1
affecting	1
story	1
so	1
many	1
opinions	1
are	1
canvassed	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
lights	1
thrown	1
upon	1
what	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
obscure	1
subjects	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
never	1
ending	1
source	1
of	1
speculation	1
and	1
astonishment	1
The	1
gentle	1
and	1
domestic	1
manners	1
it	1
described	1
combined	1
with	1
lofty	1
sentiments	1
and	1
feelings	1
which	1
had	1
for	1
their	1
object	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
self	1
accorded	1
well	1
with	1
my	1
experience	1
among	1
my	1
protectors	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
wants	1
which	1
were	1
for	1
ever	1
alive	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
bosom	1
But	1
I	1
thought	1
Werter	1
himself	1
a	1
more	1
divine	1
being	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
beheld	1
or	1
imagined	1
his	1
character	1
contained	1
no	1
pretension	1
but	1
it	1
sank	1
deep	1
The	1
disquisitions	1
upon	1
death	1
and	1
suicide	1
were	1
calculated	1
to	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
wonder	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
yet	1
I	1
inclined	1
towards	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
the	1
hero	1
whose	1
extinction	1
I	1
wept	1
without	1
precisely	1
understanding	1
it	1
As	1
I	1
read	1
however	1
I	1
applied	1
much	1
personally	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
feelings	1
and	1
condition	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
similar	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
strangely	1
unlike	1
to	1
the	1
beings	1
concerning	1
whom	1
I	1
read	1
and	1
to	1
whose	1
conversation	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
listener	1
I	1
sympathised	1
with	1
and	1
partly	1
understood	1
them	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
unformed	1
in	1
mind	1
I	1
was	1
dependent	1
on	1
none	1
and	1
related	1
to	1
none	1
The	1
path	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
was	1
free	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
lament	1
my	1
annihilation	1
My	1
person	1
was	1
hideous	1
and	1
my	1
stature	1
gigantic	1
What	1
did	1
this	1
mean	1
Who	1
was	1
I	1
What	1
was	1
I	1
Whence	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
What	1
was	1
my	1
destination	1
These	1
questions	1
continually	1
recurred	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
solve	1
them	1
The	1
volume	1
of	1
Plutarch	1
s	1
Lives	1
which	1
I	1
possessed	1
contained	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
founders	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
republics	1
This	1
book	1
had	1
a	1
far	1
different	1
effect	1
upon	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
Sorrows	1
of	1
Werter	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
Werter	1
s	1
imaginations	1
despondency	1
and	1
gloom	1
but	1
Plutarch	1
taught	1
me	1
high	1
thoughts	1
he	1
elevated	1
me	1
above	1
the	1
wretched	1
sphere	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
reflections	1
to	1
admire	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
past	1
ages	1
Many	1
things	1
I	1
read	1
surpassed	1
my	1
understanding	1
and	1
experience	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
confused	1
knowledge	1
of	1
kingdoms	1
wide	1
extents	1
of	1
country	1
mighty	1
rivers	1
and	1
boundless	1
seas	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
towns	1
and	1
large	1
assemblages	1
of	1
men	1
The	1
cottage	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
only	1
school	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
studied	1
human	1
nature	1
but	1
this	1
book	1
developed	1
new	1
and	1
mightier	1
scenes	1
of	1
action	1
I	1
read	1
of	1
men	1
concerned	1
in	1
public	1
affairs	1
governing	1
or	1
massacring	1
their	1
species	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
greatest	1
ardour	1
for	1
virtue	1
rise	1
within	1
me	1
and	1
abhorrence	1
for	1
vice	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
understood	1
the	1
signification	1
of	1
those	1
terms	1
relative	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
I	1
applied	1
them	1
to	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pain	1
alone	1
Induced	1
by	1
these	1
feelings	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
led	1
to	1
admire	1
peaceable	1
lawgivers	1
Numa	1
Solon	1
and	1
Lycurgus	1
in	1
preference	1
to	1
Romulus	1
and	1
Theseus	1
The	1
patriarchal	1
lives	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
caused	1
these	1
impressions	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
firm	1
hold	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
perhaps	1
if	1
my	1
first	1
introduction	1
to	1
humanity	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
burning	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
slaughter	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
imbued	1
with	1
different	1
sensations	1
But	1
Paradise	1
Lost	1
excited	1
different	1
and	1
far	1
deeper	1
emotions	1
I	1
read	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
other	1
volumes	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
as	1
a	1
true	1
history	1
It	1
moved	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
awe	1
that	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
an	1
omnipotent	1
God	1
warring	1
with	1
his	1
creatures	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
exciting	1
I	1
often	1
referred	1
the	1
several	1
situations	1
as	1
their	1
similarity	1
struck	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
Like	1
Adam	1
I	1
was	1
apparently	1
united	1
by	1
no	1
link	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
being	1
in	1
existence	1
but	1
his	1
state	1
was	1
far	1
different	1
from	1
mine	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
respect	1
He	1
had	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
a	1
perfect	1
creature	1
happy	1
and	1
prosperous	1
guarded	1
by	1
the	1
especial	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
Creator	1
he	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
and	1
acquire	1
knowledge	1
from	1
beings	1
of	1
a	1
superior	1
nature	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
wretched	1
helpless	1
and	1
alone	1
Many	1
times	1
I	1
considered	1
Satan	1
as	1
the	1
fitter	1
emblem	1
of	1
my	1
condition	1
for	1
often	1
like	1
him	1
when	1
I	1
viewed	1
the	1
bliss	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
the	1
bitter	1
gall	1
of	1
envy	1
rose	1
within	1
me	1
Another	1
circumstance	1
strengthened	1
and	1
confirmed	1
these	1
feelings	1
Soon	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
in	1
the	1
hovel	1
I	1
discovered	1
some	1
papers	1
in	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
your	1
laboratory	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
had	1
neglected	1
them	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
decipher	1
the	1
characters	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
written	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
study	1
them	1
with	1
diligence	1
It	1
was	1
your	1
journal	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
months	1
that	1
preceded	1
my	1
creation	1
You	1
minutely	1
described	1
in	1
these	1
papers	1
every	1
step	1
you	1
took	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
your	1
work	1
this	1
history	1
was	1
mingled	1
with	1
accounts	1
of	1
domestic	1
occurrences	1
You	1
doubtless	1
recollect	1
these	1
papers	1
Here	1
they	1
are	1
Everything	1
is	1
related	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
bears	1
reference	1
to	1
my	1
accursed	1
origin	1
the	1
whole	1
detail	1
of	1
that	1
series	1
of	1
disgusting	1
circumstances	1
which	1
produced	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
in	1
view	1
the	1
minutest	1
description	1
of	1
my	1
odious	1
and	1
loathsome	1
person	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
language	1
which	1
painted	1
your	1
own	1
horrors	1
and	1
rendered	1
mine	1
indelible	1
I	1
sickened	1
as	1
I	1
read	1
Hateful	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
received	1
life	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
agony	1
Accursed	1
creator	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
form	1
a	1
monster	1
so	1
hideous	1
that	1
even	1
you	1
turned	1
from	1
me	1
in	1
disgust	1
God	1
in	1
pity	1
made	1
man	1
beautiful	1
and	1
alluring	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
image	1
but	1
my	1
form	1
is	1
a	1
filthy	1
type	1
of	1
yours	1
more	1
horrid	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
resemblance	1
Satan	1
had	1
his	1
companions	1
fellow	1
devils	1
to	1
admire	1
and	1
encourage	1
him	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
solitary	1
and	1
abhorred	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
reflections	1
of	1
my	1
hours	1
of	1
despondency	1
and	1
solitude	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
contemplated	1
the	1
virtues	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
their	1
amiable	1
and	1
benevolent	1
dispositions	1
I	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
admiration	1
of	1
their	1
virtues	1
they	1
would	1
compassionate	1
me	1
and	1
overlook	1
my	1
personal	1
deformity	1
Could	1
they	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
door	1
one	1
however	1
monstrous	1
who	1
solicited	1
their	1
compassion	1
and	1
friendship	1
I	1
resolved	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
to	1
despair	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
to	1
fit	1
myself	1
for	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
decide	1
my	1
fate	1
I	1
postponed	1
this	1
attempt	1
for	1
some	1
months	1
longer	1
for	1
the	1
importance	1
attached	1
to	1
its	1
success	1
inspired	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
dread	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
fail	1
Besides	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
my	1
understanding	1
improved	1
so	1
much	1
with	1
every	1
day	1
s	1
experience	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
commence	1
this	1
undertaking	1
until	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
months	1
should	1
have	1
added	1
to	1
my	1
sagacity	1
Several	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
Safie	1
diffused	1
happiness	1
among	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
of	1
plenty	1
reigned	1
there	1
Felix	1
and	1
Agatha	1
spent	1
more	1
time	1
in	1
amusement	1
and	1
conversation	1
and	1
were	1
assisted	1
in	1
their	1
labours	1
by	1
servants	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
rich	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
their	1
feelings	1
were	1
serene	1
and	1
peaceful	1
while	1
mine	1
became	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
tumultuous	1
Increase	1
of	1
knowledge	1
only	1
discovered	1
to	1
me	1
more	1
clearly	1
what	1
a	1
wretched	1
outcast	1
I	1
was	1
I	1
cherished	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
it	1
vanished	1
when	1
I	1
beheld	1
my	1
person	1
reflected	1
in	1
water	1
or	1
my	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
moonshine	1
even	1
as	1
that	1
frail	1
image	1
and	1
that	1
inconstant	1
shade	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
crush	1
these	1
fears	1
and	1
to	1
fortify	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
undergo	1
and	1
sometimes	1
I	1
allowed	1
my	1
thoughts	1
unchecked	1
by	1
reason	1
to	1
ramble	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Paradise	1
and	1
dared	1
to	1
fancy	1
amiable	1
and	1
lovely	1
creatures	1
sympathising	1
with	1
my	1
feelings	1
and	1
cheering	1
my	1
gloom	1
their	1
angelic	1
countenances	1
breathed	1
smiles	1
of	1
consolation	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
dream	1
no	1
Eve	1
soothed	1
my	1
sorrows	1
nor	1
shared	1
my	1
thoughts	1
I	1
was	1
alone	1
I	1
remembered	1
Adam	1
s	1
supplication	1
to	1
his	1
Creator	1
But	1
where	1
was	1
mine	1
He	1
had	1
abandoned	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
cursed	1
him	1
Autumn	1
passed	1
thus	1
I	1
saw	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
grief	1
the	1
leaves	1
decay	1
and	1
fall	1
and	1
nature	1
again	1
assume	1
the	1
barren	1
and	1
bleak	1
appearance	1
it	1
had	1
worn	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
beheld	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1
moon	1
Yet	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
heed	1
the	1
bleakness	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
I	1
was	1
better	1
fitted	1
by	1
my	1
conformation	1
for	1
the	1
endurance	1
of	1
cold	1
than	1
heat	1
But	1
my	1
chief	1
delights	1
were	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
flowers	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
gay	1
apparel	1
of	1
summer	1
when	1
those	1
deserted	1
me	1
I	1
turned	1
with	1
more	1
attention	1
towards	1
the	1
cottagers	1
Their	1
happiness	1
was	1
not	1
decreased	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
summer	1
They	1
loved	1
and	1
sympathised	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
their	1
joys	1
depending	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
were	1
not	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
casualties	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
around	1
them	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
saw	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
greater	1
became	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
claim	1
their	1
protection	1
and	1
kindness	1
my	1
heart	1
yearned	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
loved	1
by	1
these	1
amiable	1
creatures	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
sweet	1
looks	1
directed	1
towards	1
me	1
with	1
affection	1
was	1
the	1
utmost	1
limit	1
of	1
my	1
ambition	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
turn	1
them	1
from	1
me	1
with	1
disdain	1
and	1
horror	1
The	1
poor	1
that	1
stopped	1
at	1
their	1
door	1
were	1
never	1
driven	1
away	1
I	1
asked	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
for	1
greater	1
treasures	1
than	1
a	1
little	1
food	1
or	1
rest	1
I	1
required	1
kindness	1
and	1
sympathy	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
myself	1
utterly	1
unworthy	1
of	1
it	1
The	1
winter	1
advanced	1
and	1
an	1
entire	1
revolution	1
of	1
the	1
seasons	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
since	1
I	1
awoke	1
into	1
life	1
My	1
attention	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
was	1
solely	1
directed	1
towards	1
my	1
plan	1
of	1
introducing	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
I	1
revolved	1
many	1
projects	1
but	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
finally	1
fixed	1
was	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
dwelling	1
when	1
the	1
blind	1
old	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
alone	1
I	1
had	1
sagacity	1
enough	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
unnatural	1
hideousness	1
of	1
my	1
person	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
object	1
of	1
horror	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
beheld	1
me	1
My	1
voice	1
although	1
harsh	1
had	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
thought	1
therefore	1
that	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
I	1
could	1
gain	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
and	1
mediation	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
De	1
Lacey	1
I	1
might	1
by	1
his	1
means	1
be	1
tolerated	1
by	1
my	1
younger	1
protectors	1
One	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
leaves	1
that	1
strewed	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
diffused	1
cheerfulness	1
although	1
it	1
denied	1
warmth	1
Safie	1
Agatha	1
and	1
Felix	1
departed	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
country	1
walk	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
desire	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
When	1
his	1
children	1
had	1
departed	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
guitar	1
and	1
played	1
several	1
mournful	1
but	1
sweet	1
airs	1
more	1
sweet	1
and	1
mournful	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
him	1
play	1
before	1
At	1
first	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
illuminated	1
with	1
pleasure	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
continued	1
thoughtfulness	1
and	1
sadness	1
succeeded	1
at	1
length	1
laying	1
aside	1
the	1
instrument	1
he	1
sat	1
absorbed	1
in	1
reflection	1
My	1
heart	1
beat	1
quick	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
hour	1
and	1
moment	1
of	1
trial	1
which	1
would	1
decide	1
my	1
hopes	1
or	1
realise	1
my	1
fears	1
The	1
servants	1
were	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
fair	1
All	1
was	1
silent	1
in	1
and	1
around	1
the	1
cottage	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
opportunity	1
yet	1
when	1
I	1
proceeded	1
to	1
execute	1
my	1
plan	1
my	1
limbs	1
failed	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
Again	1
I	1
rose	1
and	1
exerting	1
all	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
master	1
removed	1
the	1
planks	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
placed	1
before	1
my	1
hovel	1
to	1
conceal	1
my	1
retreat	1
The	1
fresh	1
air	1
revived	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
renewed	1
determination	1
I	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
their	1
cottage	1
I	1
knocked	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Come	1
in	1
I	1
entered	1
Pardon	1
this	1
intrusion	1
said	1
I	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
traveller	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
rest	1
you	1
would	1
greatly	1
oblige	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
Enter	1
said	1
De	1
Lacey	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
relieve	1
your	1
wants	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
blind	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
procure	1
food	1
for	1
you	1
Do	1
not	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
my	1
kind	1
host	1
I	1
have	1
food	1
it	1
is	1
warmth	1
and	1
rest	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
need	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
a	1
silence	1
ensued	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
every	1
minute	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
me	1
yet	1
I	1
remained	1
irresolute	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
to	1
commence	1
the	1
interview	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
addressed	1
me	1
By	1
your	1
language	1
stranger	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
countryman	1
are	1
you	1
French	1
No	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
educated	1
by	1
a	1
French	1
family	1
and	1
understand	1
that	1
language	1
only	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
claim	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
some	1
friends	1
whom	1
I	1
sincerely	1
love	1
and	1
of	1
whose	1
favour	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
hopes	1
Are	1
they	1
Germans	1
No	1
they	1
are	1
French	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
deserted	1
creature	1
I	1
look	1
around	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
relation	1
or	1
friend	1
upon	1
earth	1
These	1
amiable	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
go	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
me	1
and	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
fears	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
fail	1
there	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
outcast	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
ever	1
Do	1
not	1
despair	1
To	1
be	1
friendless	1
is	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
unfortunate	1
but	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
men	1
when	1
unprejudiced	1
by	1
any	1
obvious	1
self	1
interest	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
brotherly	1
love	1
and	1
charity	1
Rely	1
therefore	1
on	1
your	1
hopes	1
and	1
if	1
these	1
friends	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
amiable	1
do	1
not	1
despair	1
They	1
are	1
kind	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
creatures	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
they	1
are	1
prejudiced	1
against	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
good	1
dispositions	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
hitherto	1
harmless	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
beneficial	1
but	1
a	1
fatal	1
prejudice	1
clouds	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
feeling	1
and	1
kind	1
friend	1
they	1
behold	1
only	1
a	1
detestable	1
monster	1
That	1
is	1
indeed	1
unfortunate	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
blameless	1
cannot	1
you	1
undeceive	1
them	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
undertake	1
that	1
task	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
so	1
many	1
overwhelming	1
terrors	1
I	1
tenderly	1
love	1
these	1
friends	1
I	1
have	1
unknown	1
to	1
them	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
daily	1
kindness	1
towards	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
injure	1
them	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
prejudice	1
which	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
overcome	1
Where	1
do	1
these	1
friends	1
reside	1
Near	1
this	1
spot	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
paused	1
and	1
then	1
continued	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
unreservedly	1
confide	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
your	1
tale	1
I	1
perhaps	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
undeceiving	1
them	1
I	1
am	1
blind	1
and	1
cannot	1
judge	1
of	1
your	1
countenance	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
your	1
words	1
which	1
persuades	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sincere	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
an	1
exile	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
afford	1
me	1
true	1
pleasure	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
serviceable	1
to	1
a	1
human	1
creature	1
Excellent	1
man	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
and	1
accept	1
your	1
generous	1
offer	1
You	1
raise	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
by	1
this	1
kindness	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
by	1
your	1
aid	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
and	1
sympathy	1
of	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
Heaven	1
forbid	1
Even	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
really	1
criminal	1
for	1
that	1
can	1
only	1
drive	1
you	1
to	1
desperation	1
and	1
not	1
instigate	1
you	1
to	1
virtue	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
unfortunate	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
have	1
been	1
condemned	1
although	1
innocent	1
judge	1
therefore	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
for	1
your	1
misfortunes	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
my	1
best	1
and	1
only	1
benefactor	1
From	1
your	1
lips	1
first	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
kindness	1
directed	1
towards	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
grateful	1
and	1
your	1
present	1
humanity	1
assures	1
me	1
of	1
success	1
with	1
those	1
friends	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
meeting	1
May	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
names	1
and	1
residence	1
of	1
those	1
friends	1
I	1
paused	1
This	1
I	1
thought	1
was	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
decision	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
or	1
bestow	1
happiness	1
on	1
me	1
for	1
ever	1
I	1
struggled	1
vainly	1
for	1
firmness	1
sufficient	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
effort	1
destroyed	1
all	1
my	1
remaining	1
strength	1
I	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
and	1
sobbed	1
aloud	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
my	1
younger	1
protectors	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
lose	1
but	1
seizing	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
I	1
cried	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
Save	1
and	1
protect	1
me	1
You	1
and	1
your	1
family	1
are	1
the	1
friends	1
whom	1
I	1
seek	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
desert	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
trial	1
Great	1
God	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
Who	1
are	1
you	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
cottage	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
Felix	1
Safie	1
and	1
Agatha	1
entered	1
Who	1
can	1
describe	1
their	1
horror	1
and	1
consternation	1
on	1
beholding	1
me	1
Agatha	1
fainted	1
and	1
Safie	1
unable	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
Felix	1
darted	1
forward	1
and	1
with	1
supernatural	1
force	1
tore	1
me	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
whose	1
knees	1
I	1
clung	1
in	1
a	1
transport	1
of	1
fury	1
he	1
dashed	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
struck	1
me	1
violently	1
with	1
a	1
stick	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
torn	1
him	1
limb	1
from	1
limb	1
as	1
the	1
lion	1
rends	1
the	1
antelope	1
But	1
my	1
heart	1
sank	1
within	1
me	1
as	1
with	1
bitter	1
sickness	1
and	1
I	1
refrained	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
repeating	1
his	1
blow	1
when	1
overcome	1
by	1
pain	1
and	1
anguish	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
tumult	1
escaped	1
unperceived	1
to	1
my	1
hovel	1

Cursed	1
cursed	1

Why	1
did	1
I	1
live	1
Why	1
in	1
that	1
instant	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
extinguish	1
the	1
spark	1
of	1
existence	1
which	1
you	1
had	1
so	1
wantonly	1
bestowed	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
despair	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
me	1
my	1
feelings	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
rage	1
and	1
revenge	1
I	1
could	1
with	1
pleasure	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
have	1
glutted	1
myself	1
with	1
their	1
shrieks	1
and	1
misery	1
When	1
night	1
came	1
I	1
quitted	1
my	1
retreat	1
and	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
restrained	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
discovery	1
I	1
gave	1
vent	1
to	1
my	1
anguish	1
in	1
fearful	1
howlings	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
that	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
toils	1
destroying	1
the	1
objects	1
that	1
obstructed	1
me	1
and	1
ranging	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
with	1
a	1
stag	1
like	1
swiftness	1
Oh	1
What	1
a	1
miserable	1
night	1
I	1
passed	1
The	1
cold	1
stars	1
shone	1
in	1
mockery	1
and	1
the	1
bare	1
trees	1
waved	1
their	1
branches	1
above	1
me	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
sweet	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
bird	1
burst	1
forth	1
amidst	1
the	1
universal	1
stillness	1
All	1
save	1
I	1
were	1
at	1
rest	1
or	1
in	1
enjoyment	1
I	1
like	1
the	1
arch	1
fiend	1
bore	1
a	1
hell	1
within	1
me	1
and	1
finding	1
myself	1
unsympathised	1
with	1
wished	1
to	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
trees	1
spread	1
havoc	1
and	1
destruction	1
around	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
have	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
ruin	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
luxury	1
of	1
sensation	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
I	1
became	1
fatigued	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
bodily	1
exertion	1
and	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
damp	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
impotence	1
of	1
despair	1
There	1
was	1
none	1
among	1
the	1
myriads	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
existed	1
who	1
would	1
pity	1
or	1
assist	1
me	1
and	1
should	1
I	1
feel	1
kindness	1
towards	1
my	1
enemies	1
No	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
declared	1
everlasting	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
species	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
against	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
formed	1
me	1
and	1
sent	1
me	1
forth	1
to	1
this	1
insupportable	1
misery	1
The	1
sun	1
rose	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
retreat	1
during	1
that	1
day	1
Accordingly	1
I	1
hid	1
myself	1
in	1
some	1
thick	1
underwood	1
determining	1
to	1
devote	1
the	1
ensuing	1
hours	1
to	1
reflection	1
on	1
my	1
situation	1
The	1
pleasant	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
pure	1
air	1
of	1
day	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
considered	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
believing	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
hasty	1
in	1
my	1
conclusions	1
I	1
had	1
certainly	1
acted	1
imprudently	1
It	1
was	1
apparent	1
that	1
my	1
conversation	1
had	1
interested	1
the	1
father	1
in	1
my	1
behalf	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
having	1
exposed	1
my	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
familiarised	1
the	1
old	1
De	1
Lacey	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
have	1
discovered	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
my	1
approach	1
But	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
my	1
errors	1
to	1
be	1
irretrievable	1
and	1
after	1
much	1
consideration	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
seek	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
representations	1
win	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
party	1
These	1
thoughts	1
calmed	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
I	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
profound	1
sleep	1
but	1
the	1
fever	1
of	1
my	1
blood	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
visited	1
by	1
peaceful	1
dreams	1
The	1
horrible	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
day	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
acting	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
the	1
females	1
were	1
flying	1
and	1
the	1
enraged	1
Felix	1
tearing	1
me	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
feet	1
I	1
awoke	1
exhausted	1
and	1
finding	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
night	1
I	1
crept	1
forth	1
from	1
my	1
hiding	1
place	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
food	1
When	1
my	1
hunger	1
was	1
appeased	1
I	1
directed	1
my	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
well	1
known	1
path	1
that	1
conducted	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
All	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
I	1
crept	1
into	1
my	1
hovel	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
silent	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
accustomed	1
hour	1
when	1
the	1
family	1
arose	1
That	1
hour	1
passed	1
the	1
sun	1
mounted	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
but	1
the	1
cottagers	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
I	1
trembled	1
violently	1
apprehending	1
some	1
dreadful	1
misfortune	1
The	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
no	1
motion	1
I	1
cannot	1
describe	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
this	1
suspense	1
Presently	1
two	1
countrymen	1
passed	1
by	1
but	1
pausing	1
near	1
the	1
cottage	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
using	1
violent	1
gesticulations	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
as	1
they	1
spoke	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
differed	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
Soon	1
after	1
however	1
Felix	1
approached	1
with	1
another	1
man	1
I	1
was	1
surprised	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
quitted	1
the	1
cottage	1
that	1
morning	1
and	1
waited	1
anxiously	1
to	1
discover	1
from	1
his	1
discourse	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
these	1
unusual	1
appearances	1
Do	1
you	1
consider	1
said	1
his	1
companion	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
pay	1
three	1
months	1
rent	1
and	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
produce	1
of	1
your	1
garden	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
unfair	1
advantage	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
therefore	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
take	1
some	1
days	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
your	1
determination	1
It	1
is	1
utterly	1
useless	1
replied	1
Felix	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
again	1
inhabit	1
your	1
cottage	1
The	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
dreadful	1
circumstance	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
related	1
My	1
wife	1
and	1
my	1
sister	1
will	1
never	1
recover	1
from	1
their	1
horror	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
Take	1
possession	1
of	1
your	1
tenement	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
fly	1
from	1
this	1
place	1
Felix	1
trembled	1
violently	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
He	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
entered	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
and	1
then	1
departed	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
De	1
Lacey	1
more	1
I	1
continued	1
for	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
utter	1
and	1
stupid	1
despair	1
My	1
protectors	1
had	1
departed	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
only	1
link	1
that	1
held	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
revenge	1
and	1
hatred	1
filled	1
my	1
bosom	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
strive	1
to	1
control	1
them	1
but	1
allowing	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
stream	1
I	1
bent	1
my	1
mind	1
towards	1
injury	1
and	1
death	1
When	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
mild	1
voice	1
of	1
De	1
Lacey	1
the	1
gentle	1
eyes	1
of	1
Agatha	1
and	1
the	1
exquisite	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
Arabian	1
these	1
thoughts	1
vanished	1
and	1
a	1
gush	1
of	1
tears	1
somewhat	1
soothed	1
me	1
But	1
again	1
when	1
I	1
reflected	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
spurned	1
and	1
deserted	1
me	1
anger	1
returned	1
a	1
rage	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
injure	1
anything	1
human	1
I	1
turned	1
my	1
fury	1
towards	1
inanimate	1
objects	1
As	1
night	1
advanced	1
I	1
placed	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
combustibles	1
around	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
destroyed	1
every	1
vestige	1
of	1
cultivation	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
I	1
waited	1
with	1
forced	1
impatience	1
until	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
sunk	1
to	1
commence	1
my	1
operations	1
As	1
the	1
night	1
advanced	1
a	1
fierce	1
wind	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
quickly	1
dispersed	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
had	1
loitered	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
the	1
blast	1
tore	1
along	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
avalanche	1
and	1
produced	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
insanity	1
in	1
my	1
spirits	1
that	1
burst	1
all	1
bounds	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
reflection	1
I	1
lighted	1
the	1
dry	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
fury	1
around	1
the	1
devoted	1
cottage	1
my	1
eyes	1
still	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
western	1
horizon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
moon	1
nearly	1
touched	1
A	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
orb	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
hid	1
and	1
I	1
waved	1
my	1
brand	1
it	1
sank	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
scream	1
I	1
fired	1
the	1
straw	1
and	1
heath	1
and	1
bushes	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
collected	1
The	1
wind	1
fanned	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
cottage	1
was	1
quickly	1
enveloped	1
by	1
the	1
flames	1
which	1
clung	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
licked	1
it	1
with	1
their	1
forked	1
and	1
destroying	1
tongues	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
assistance	1
could	1
save	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
habitation	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
scene	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
And	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
world	1
before	1
me	1
whither	1
should	1
I	1
bend	1
my	1
steps	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
fly	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
hated	1
and	1
despised	1
every	1
country	1
must	1
be	1
equally	1
horrible	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
you	1
crossed	1
my	1
mind	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
your	1
papers	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
my	1
father	1
my	1
creator	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
could	1
I	1
apply	1
with	1
more	1
fitness	1
than	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
life	1
Among	1
the	1
lessons	1
that	1
Felix	1
had	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
Safie	1
geography	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
omitted	1
I	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
these	1
the	1
relative	1
situations	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
countries	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
You	1
had	1
mentioned	1
Geneva	1
as	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
native	1
town	1
and	1
towards	1
this	1
place	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
proceed	1
But	1
how	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
direct	1
myself	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
travel	1
in	1
a	1
southwesterly	1
direction	1
to	1
reach	1
my	1
destination	1
but	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
my	1
only	1
guide	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
towns	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
ask	1
information	1
from	1
a	1
single	1
human	1
being	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
despair	1
From	1
you	1
only	1
could	1
I	1
hope	1
for	1
succour	1
although	1
towards	1
you	1
I	1
felt	1
no	1
sentiment	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
hatred	1
Unfeeling	1
heartless	1
creator	1
You	1
had	1
endowed	1
me	1
with	1
perceptions	1
and	1
passions	1
and	1
then	1
cast	1
me	1
abroad	1
an	1
object	1
for	1
the	1
scorn	1
and	1
horror	1
of	1
mankind	1
But	1
on	1
you	1
only	1
had	1
I	1
any	1
claim	1
for	1
pity	1
and	1
redress	1
and	1
from	1
you	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
seek	1
that	1
justice	1
which	1
I	1
vainly	1
attempted	1
to	1
gain	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
being	1
that	1
wore	1
the	1
human	1
form	1
My	1
travels	1
were	1
long	1
and	1
the	1
sufferings	1
I	1
endured	1
intense	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
autumn	1
when	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
district	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
resided	1
I	1
travelled	1
only	1
at	1
night	1
fearful	1
of	1
encountering	1
the	1
visage	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
Nature	1
decayed	1
around	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
heatless	1
rain	1
and	1
snow	1
poured	1
around	1
me	1
mighty	1
rivers	1
were	1
frozen	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
hard	1
and	1
chill	1
and	1
bare	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
no	1
shelter	1
Oh	1
earth	1
How	1
often	1
did	1
I	1
imprecate	1
curses	1
on	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
The	1
mildness	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
had	1
fled	1
and	1
all	1
within	1
me	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
gall	1
and	1
bitterness	1
The	1
nearer	1
I	1
approached	1
to	1
your	1
habitation	1
the	1
more	1
deeply	1
did	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revenge	1
enkindled	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
Snow	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
hardened	1
but	1
I	1
rested	1
not	1
A	1
few	1
incidents	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
directed	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
possessed	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
I	1
often	1
wandered	1
wide	1
from	1
my	1
path	1
The	1
agony	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
allowed	1
me	1
no	1
respite	1
no	1
incident	1
occurred	1
from	1
which	1
my	1
rage	1
and	1
misery	1
could	1
not	1
extract	1
its	1
food	1
but	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
happened	1
when	1
I	1
arrived	1
on	1
the	1
confines	1
of	1
Switzerland	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
recovered	1
its	1
warmth	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
green	1
confirmed	1
in	1
an	1
especial	1
manner	1
the	1
bitterness	1
and	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
I	1
generally	1
rested	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
travelled	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
secured	1
by	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
man	1
One	1
morning	1
however	1
finding	1
that	1
my	1
path	1
lay	1
through	1
a	1
deep	1
wood	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
continue	1
my	1
journey	1
after	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
risen	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
spring	1
cheered	1
even	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
loveliness	1
of	1
its	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
balminess	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
I	1
felt	1
emotions	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
pleasure	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
appeared	1
dead	1
revive	1
within	1
me	1
Half	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
these	1
sensations	1
I	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
forgetting	1
my	1
solitude	1
and	1
deformity	1
dared	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
Soft	1
tears	1
again	1
bedewed	1
my	1
cheeks	1
and	1
I	1
even	1
raised	1
my	1
humid	1
eyes	1
with	1
thankfulness	1
towards	1
the	1
blessed	1
sun	1
which	1
bestowed	1
such	1
joy	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
continued	1
to	1
wind	1
among	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
until	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
its	1
boundary	1
which	1
was	1
skirted	1
by	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
rapid	1
river	1
into	1
which	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
bent	1
their	1
branches	1
now	1
budding	1
with	1
the	1
fresh	1
spring	1
Here	1
I	1
paused	1
not	1
exactly	1
knowing	1
what	1
path	1
to	1
pursue	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
that	1
induced	1
me	1
to	1
conceal	1
myself	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
cypress	1
I	1
was	1
scarcely	1
hid	1
when	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
came	1
running	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
concealed	1
laughing	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
ran	1
from	1
someone	1
in	1
sport	1
She	1
continued	1
her	1
course	1
along	1
the	1
precipitous	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
when	1
suddenly	1
her	1
foot	1
slipped	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
rapid	1
stream	1
I	1
rushed	1
from	1
my	1
hiding	1
place	1
and	1
with	1
extreme	1
labour	1
from	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
saved	1
her	1
and	1
dragged	1
her	1
to	1
shore	1
She	1
was	1
senseless	1
and	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
by	1
every	1
means	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
restore	1
animation	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
suddenly	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
rustic	1
who	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
person	1
from	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
playfully	1
fled	1
On	1
seeing	1
me	1
he	1
darted	1
towards	1
me	1
and	1
tearing	1
the	1
girl	1
from	1
my	1
arms	1
hastened	1
towards	1
the	1
deeper	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
I	1
followed	1
speedily	1
I	1
hardly	1
knew	1
why	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
saw	1
me	1
draw	1
near	1
he	1
aimed	1
a	1
gun	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
at	1
my	1
body	1
and	1
fired	1
I	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
my	1
injurer	1
with	1
increased	1
swiftness	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
This	1
was	1
then	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
my	1
benevolence	1
I	1
had	1
saved	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
from	1
destruction	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
recompense	1
I	1
now	1
writhed	1
under	1
the	1
miserable	1
pain	1
of	1
a	1
wound	1
which	1
shattered	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
bone	1
The	1
feelings	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
entertained	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
before	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
hellish	1
rage	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth	1
Inflamed	1
by	1
pain	1
I	1
vowed	1
eternal	1
hatred	1
and	1
vengeance	1
to	1
all	1
mankind	1
But	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
my	1
wound	1
overcame	1
me	1
my	1
pulses	1
paused	1
and	1
I	1
fainted	1
For	1
some	1
weeks	1
I	1
led	1
a	1
miserable	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
cure	1
the	1
wound	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
received	1
The	1
ball	1
had	1
entered	1
my	1
shoulder	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
remained	1
there	1
or	1
passed	1
through	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
extracting	1
it	1
My	1
sufferings	1
were	1
augmented	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
oppressive	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
and	1
ingratitude	1
of	1
their	1
infliction	1
My	1
daily	1
vows	1
rose	1
for	1
revenge	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
deadly	1
revenge	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
alone	1
compensate	1
for	1
the	1
outrages	1
and	1
anguish	1
I	1
had	1
endured	1
After	1
some	1
weeks	1
my	1
wound	1
healed	1
and	1
I	1
continued	1
my	1
journey	1
The	1
labours	1
I	1
endured	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
alleviated	1
by	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
or	1
gentle	1
breezes	1
of	1
spring	1
all	1
joy	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
mockery	1
which	1
insulted	1
my	1
desolate	1
state	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
feel	1
more	1
painfully	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
pleasure	1
But	1
my	1
toils	1
now	1
drew	1
near	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
months	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
reached	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
Geneva	1
It	1
was	1
evening	1
when	1
I	1
arrived	1
and	1
I	1
retired	1
to	1
a	1
hiding	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
fields	1
that	1
surround	1
it	1
to	1
meditate	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
should	1
apply	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
hunger	1
and	1
far	1
too	1
unhappy	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
gentle	1
breezes	1
of	1
evening	1
or	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
setting	1
behind	1
the	1
stupendous	1
mountains	1
of	1
Jura	1
At	1
this	1
time	1
a	1
slight	1
sleep	1
relieved	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
reflection	1
which	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
child	1
who	1
came	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
recess	1
I	1
had	1
chosen	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sportiveness	1
of	1
infancy	1
Suddenly	1
as	1
I	1
gazed	1
on	1
him	1
an	1
idea	1
seized	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
little	1
creature	1
was	1
unprejudiced	1
and	1
had	1
lived	1
too	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
imbibed	1
a	1
horror	1
of	1
deformity	1
If	1
therefore	1
I	1
could	1
seize	1
him	1
and	1
educate	1
him	1
as	1
my	1
companion	1
and	1
friend	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
desolate	1
in	1
this	1
peopled	1
earth	1
Urged	1
by	1
this	1
impulse	1
I	1
seized	1
on	1
the	1
boy	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
towards	1
me	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
beheld	1
my	1
form	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
shrill	1
scream	1
I	1
drew	1
his	1
hand	1
forcibly	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
said	1
Child	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
hurt	1
you	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
He	1
struggled	1
violently	1
Let	1
me	1
go	1
he	1
cried	1
monster	1
Ugly	1
wretch	1
You	1
wish	1
to	1
eat	1
me	1
and	1
tear	1
me	1
to	1
pieces	1
You	1
are	1
an	1
ogre	1
Let	1
me	1
go	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
my	1
papa	1
Boy	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
your	1
father	1
again	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
Hideous	1
monster	1
Let	1
me	1
go	1
My	1
papa	1
is	1
a	1
syndic	1
he	1
is	1
M	1
Frankenstein	1
he	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
You	1
dare	1
not	1
keep	1
me	1
Frankenstein	1
you	1
belong	1
then	1
to	1
my	1
enemy	1
to	1
him	1
towards	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
eternal	1
revenge	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
first	1
victim	1
The	1
child	1
still	1
struggled	1
and	1
loaded	1
me	1
with	1
epithets	1
which	1
carried	1
despair	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
grasped	1
his	1
throat	1
to	1
silence	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
lay	1
dead	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
I	1
gazed	1
on	1
my	1
victim	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
swelled	1
with	1
exultation	1
and	1
hellish	1
triumph	1
clapping	1
my	1
hands	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
I	1
too	1
can	1
create	1
desolation	1
my	1
enemy	1
is	1
not	1
invulnerable	1
this	1
death	1
will	1
carry	1
despair	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
other	1
miseries	1
shall	1
torment	1
and	1
destroy	1
him	1
As	1
I	1
fixed	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
child	1
I	1
saw	1
something	1
glittering	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
lovely	1
woman	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
malignity	1
it	1
softened	1
and	1
attracted	1
me	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
I	1
gazed	1
with	1
delight	1
on	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
fringed	1
by	1
deep	1
lashes	1
and	1
her	1
lovely	1
lips	1
but	1
presently	1
my	1
rage	1
returned	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
delights	1
that	1
such	1
beautiful	1
creatures	1
could	1
bestow	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
whose	1
resemblance	1
I	1
contemplated	1
would	1
in	1
regarding	1
me	1
have	1
changed	1
that	1
air	1
of	1
divine	1
benignity	1
to	1
one	1
expressive	1
of	1
disgust	1
and	1
affright	1
Can	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
such	1
thoughts	1
transported	1
me	1
with	1
rage	1
I	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
instead	1
of	1
venting	1
my	1
sensations	1
in	1
exclamations	1
and	1
agony	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
rush	1
among	1
mankind	1
and	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
these	1
feelings	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
committed	1
the	1
murder	1
and	1
seeking	1
a	1
more	1
secluded	1
hiding	1
place	1
I	1
entered	1
a	1
barn	1
which	1
had	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
empty	1
A	1
woman	1
was	1
sleeping	1
on	1
some	1
straw	1
she	1
was	1
young	1
not	1
indeed	1
so	1
beautiful	1
as	1
her	1
whose	1
portrait	1
I	1
held	1
but	1
of	1
an	1
agreeable	1
aspect	1
and	1
blooming	1
in	1
the	1
loveliness	1
of	1
youth	1
and	1
health	1
Here	1
I	1
thought	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
joy	1
imparting	1
smiles	1
are	1
bestowed	1
on	1
all	1
but	1
me	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
whispered	1
Awake	1
fairest	1
thy	1
lover	1
is	1
near	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
but	1
to	1
obtain	1
one	1
look	1
of	1
affection	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes	1
my	1
beloved	1
awake	1
The	1
sleeper	1
stirred	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
terror	1
ran	1
through	1
me	1
Should	1
she	1
indeed	1
awake	1
and	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
curse	1
me	1
and	1
denounce	1
the	1
murderer	1
Thus	1
would	1
she	1
assuredly	1
act	1
if	1
her	1
darkened	1
eyes	1
opened	1
and	1
she	1
beheld	1
me	1
The	1
thought	1
was	1
madness	1
it	1
stirred	1
the	1
fiend	1
within	1
me	1
not	1
I	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
suffer	1
the	1
murder	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
ever	1
robbed	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
me	1
she	1
shall	1
atone	1
The	1
crime	1
had	1
its	1
source	1
in	1
her	1
be	1
hers	1
the	1
punishment	1
Thanks	1
to	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
Felix	1
and	1
the	1
sanguinary	1
laws	1
of	1
man	1
I	1
had	1
learned	1
now	1
to	1
work	1
mischief	1
I	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
placed	1
the	1
portrait	1
securely	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
She	1
moved	1
again	1
and	1
I	1
fled	1
For	1
some	1
days	1
I	1
haunted	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
these	1
scenes	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
sometimes	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
sometimes	1
resolved	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
its	1
miseries	1
for	1
ever	1
At	1
length	1
I	1
wandered	1
towards	1
these	1
mountains	1
and	1
have	1
ranged	1
through	1
their	1
immense	1
recesses	1
consumed	1
by	1
a	1
burning	1
passion	1
which	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
gratify	1
We	1
may	1
not	1
part	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
my	1
requisition	1
I	1
am	1
alone	1
and	1
miserable	1
man	1
will	1
not	1
associate	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
one	1
as	1
deformed	1
and	1
horrible	1
as	1
myself	1
would	1
not	1
deny	1
herself	1
to	1
me	1
My	1
companion	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
species	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
defects	1
This	1
being	1
you	1
must	1
create	1
Chapter	1
17	1
The	1
being	1
finished	1
speaking	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
looks	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
a	1
reply	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
bewildered	1
perplexed	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
arrange	1
my	1
ideas	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
full	1
extent	1
of	1
his	1
proposition	1
He	1
continued	1
You	1
must	1
create	1
a	1
female	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
those	1
sympathies	1
necessary	1
for	1
my	1
being	1
This	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
do	1
and	1
I	1
demand	1
it	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
right	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
concede	1
The	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
tale	1
had	1
kindled	1
anew	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
anger	1
that	1
had	1
died	1
away	1
while	1
he	1
narrated	1
his	1
peaceful	1
life	1
among	1
the	1
cottagers	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
suppress	1
the	1
rage	1
that	1
burned	1
within	1
me	1
I	1
do	1
refuse	1
it	1
I	1
replied	1
and	1
no	1
torture	1
shall	1
ever	1
extort	1
a	1
consent	1
from	1
me	1
You	1
may	1
render	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
never	1
make	1
me	1
base	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
Shall	1
I	1
create	1
another	1
like	1
yourself	1
whose	1
joint	1
wickedness	1
might	1
desolate	1
the	1
world	1
Begone	1
I	1
have	1
answered	1
you	1
you	1
may	1
torture	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
consent	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
replied	1
the	1
fiend	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
threatening	1
I	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
malicious	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
miserable	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
shunned	1
and	1
hated	1
by	1
all	1
mankind	1
You	1
my	1
creator	1
would	1
tear	1
me	1
to	1
pieces	1
and	1
triumph	1
remember	1
that	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
pity	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
pities	1
me	1
You	1
would	1
not	1
call	1
it	1
murder	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
precipitate	1
me	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
ice	1
rifts	1
and	1
destroy	1
my	1
frame	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
hands	1
Shall	1
I	1
respect	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
condemns	1
me	1
Let	1
him	1
live	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
injury	1
I	1
would	1
bestow	1
every	1
benefit	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
gratitude	1
at	1
his	1
acceptance	1
But	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
human	1
senses	1
are	1
insurmountable	1
barriers	1
to	1
our	1
union	1
Yet	1
mine	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
abject	1
slavery	1
I	1
will	1
revenge	1
my	1
injuries	1
if	1
I	1
cannot	1
inspire	1
love	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
fear	1
and	1
chiefly	1
towards	1
you	1
my	1
arch	1
enemy	1
because	1
my	1
creator	1
do	1
I	1
swear	1
inextinguishable	1
hatred	1
Have	1
a	1
care	1
I	1
will	1
work	1
at	1
your	1
destruction	1
nor	1
finish	1
until	1
I	1
desolate	1
your	1
heart	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
curse	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
your	1
birth	1
A	1
fiendish	1
rage	1
animated	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
wrinkled	1
into	1
contortions	1
too	1
horrible	1
for	1
human	1
eyes	1
to	1
behold	1
but	1
presently	1
he	1
calmed	1
himself	1
and	1
proceeded	1
I	1
intended	1
to	1
reason	1
This	1
passion	1
is	1
detrimental	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
reflect	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
its	1
excess	1
If	1
any	1
being	1
felt	1
emotions	1
of	1
benevolence	1
towards	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
return	1
them	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
a	1
hundredfold	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
creature	1
s	1
sake	1
I	1
would	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
kind	1
But	1
I	1
now	1
indulge	1
in	1
dreams	1
of	1
bliss	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
realised	1
What	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
reasonable	1
and	1
moderate	1
I	1
demand	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
another	1
sex	1
but	1
as	1
hideous	1
as	1
myself	1
the	1
gratification	1
is	1
small	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
receive	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
content	1
me	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
monsters	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
attached	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
Our	1
lives	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
happy	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
harmless	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
misery	1
I	1
now	1
feel	1
Oh	1
My	1
creator	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
let	1
me	1
feel	1
gratitude	1
towards	1
you	1
for	1
one	1
benefit	1
Let	1
me	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
excite	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
some	1
existing	1
thing	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
me	1
my	1
request	1
I	1
was	1
moved	1
I	1
shuddered	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
possible	1
consequences	1
of	1
my	1
consent	1
but	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
justice	1
in	1
his	1
argument	1
His	1
tale	1
and	1
the	1
feelings	1
he	1
now	1
expressed	1
proved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
fine	1
sensations	1
and	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
as	1
his	1
maker	1
owe	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
bestow	1
He	1
saw	1
my	1
change	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
continued	1
If	1
you	1
consent	1
neither	1
you	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
human	1
being	1
shall	1
ever	1
see	1
us	1
again	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
vast	1
wilds	1
of	1
South	1
America	1
My	1
food	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
man	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
lamb	1
and	1
the	1
kid	1
to	1
glut	1
my	1
appetite	1
acorns	1
and	1
berries	1
afford	1
me	1
sufficient	1
nourishment	1
My	1
companion	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
nature	1
as	1
myself	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
fare	1
We	1
shall	1
make	1
our	1
bed	1
of	1
dried	1
leaves	1
the	1
sun	1
will	1
shine	1
on	1
us	1
as	1
on	1
man	1
and	1
will	1
ripen	1
our	1
food	1
The	1
picture	1
I	1
present	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
peaceful	1
and	1
human	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
deny	1
it	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
wantonness	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
cruelty	1
Pitiless	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
towards	1
me	1
I	1
now	1
see	1
compassion	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
let	1
me	1
seize	1
the	1
favourable	1
moment	1
and	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
promise	1
what	1
I	1
so	1
ardently	1
desire	1
You	1
propose	1
replied	1
I	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
man	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
those	1
wilds	1
where	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
only	1
companions	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
who	1
long	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
sympathy	1
of	1
man	1
persevere	1
in	1
this	1
exile	1
You	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
again	1
seek	1
their	1
kindness	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
their	1
detestation	1
your	1
evil	1
passions	1
will	1
be	1
renewed	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
then	1
have	1
a	1
companion	1
to	1
aid	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
destruction	1
This	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
cease	1
to	1
argue	1
the	1
point	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
consent	1
How	1
inconstant	1
are	1
your	1
feelings	1
But	1
a	1
moment	1
ago	1
you	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
my	1
representations	1
and	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
again	1
harden	1
yourself	1
to	1
my	1
complaints	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
I	1
inhabit	1
and	1
by	1
you	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
companion	1
you	1
bestow	1
I	1
will	1
quit	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
dwell	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
chance	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
savage	1
of	1
places	1
My	1
evil	1
passions	1
will	1
have	1
fled	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
meet	1
with	1
sympathy	1
My	1
life	1
will	1
flow	1
quietly	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
dying	1
moments	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
curse	1
my	1
maker	1
His	1
words	1
had	1
a	1
strange	1
effect	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
compassionated	1
him	1
and	1
sometimes	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
console	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
him	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
filthy	1
mass	1
that	1
moved	1
and	1
talked	1
my	1
heart	1
sickened	1
and	1
my	1
feelings	1
were	1
altered	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
hatred	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
stifle	1
these	1
sensations	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
sympathise	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
withhold	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
small	1
portion	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
bestow	1
You	1
swear	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
harmless	1
but	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
already	1
shown	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
malice	1
that	1
should	1
reasonably	1
make	1
me	1
distrust	1
you	1
May	1
not	1
even	1
this	1
be	1
a	1
feint	1
that	1
will	1
increase	1
your	1
triumph	1
by	1
affording	1
a	1
wider	1
scope	1
for	1
your	1
revenge	1
How	1
is	1
this	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
trifled	1
with	1
and	1
I	1
demand	1
an	1
answer	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
ties	1
and	1
no	1
affections	1
hatred	1
and	1
vice	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
portion	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
another	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
crimes	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
whose	1
existence	1
everyone	1
will	1
be	1
ignorant	1
My	1
vices	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
forced	1
solitude	1
that	1
I	1
abhor	1
and	1
my	1
virtues	1
will	1
necessarily	1
arise	1
when	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
communion	1
with	1
an	1
equal	1
I	1
shall	1
feel	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
a	1
sensitive	1
being	1
and	1
become	1
linked	1
to	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
existence	1
and	1
events	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
excluded	1
I	1
paused	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
related	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
arguments	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
employed	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
virtues	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
displayed	1
on	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
the	1
subsequent	1
blight	1
of	1
all	1
kindly	1
feeling	1
by	1
the	1
loathing	1
and	1
scorn	1
which	1
his	1
protectors	1
had	1
manifested	1
towards	1
him	1
His	1
power	1
and	1
threats	1
were	1
not	1
omitted	1
in	1
my	1
calculations	1
a	1
creature	1
who	1
could	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
ice	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
glaciers	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
from	1
pursuit	1
among	1
the	1
ridges	1
of	1
inaccessible	1
precipices	1
was	1
a	1
being	1
possessing	1
faculties	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
vain	1
to	1
cope	1
with	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
pause	1
of	1
reflection	1
I	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
justice	1
due	1
both	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
demanded	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
request	1
Turning	1
to	1
him	1
therefore	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
consent	1
to	1
your	1
demand	1
on	1
your	1
solemn	1
oath	1
to	1
quit	1
Europe	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
deliver	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
a	1
female	1
who	1
will	1
accompany	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
exile	1
I	1
swear	1
he	1
cried	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
blue	1
sky	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
love	1
that	1
burns	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
grant	1
my	1
prayer	1
while	1
they	1
exist	1
you	1
shall	1
never	1
behold	1
me	1
again	1
Depart	1
to	1
your	1
home	1
and	1
commence	1
your	1
labours	1
I	1
shall	1
watch	1
their	1
progress	1
with	1
unutterable	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
ready	1
I	1
shall	1
appear	1
Saying	1
this	1
he	1
suddenly	1
quitted	1
me	1
fearful	1
perhaps	1
of	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
sentiments	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
descend	1
the	1
mountain	1
with	1
greater	1
speed	1
than	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
an	1
eagle	1
and	1
quickly	1
lost	1
among	1
the	1
undulations	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
His	1
tale	1
had	1
occupied	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
the	1
horizon	1
when	1
he	1
departed	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
hasten	1
my	1
descent	1
towards	1
the	1
valley	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
be	1
encompassed	1
in	1
darkness	1
but	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
heavy	1
and	1
my	1
steps	1
slow	1
The	1
labour	1
of	1
winding	1
among	1
the	1
little	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
and	1
fixing	1
my	1
feet	1
firmly	1
as	1
I	1
advanced	1
perplexed	1
me	1
occupied	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
emotions	1
which	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
had	1
produced	1
Night	1
was	1
far	1
advanced	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
halfway	1
resting	1
place	1
and	1
seated	1
myself	1
beside	1
the	1
fountain	1
The	1
stars	1
shone	1
at	1
intervals	1
as	1
the	1
clouds	1
passed	1
from	1
over	1
them	1
the	1
dark	1
pines	1
rose	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
every	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
broken	1
tree	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
wonderful	1
solemnity	1
and	1
stirred	1
strange	1
thoughts	1
within	1
me	1
I	1
wept	1
bitterly	1
and	1
clasping	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
agony	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
Oh	1
stars	1
and	1
clouds	1
and	1
winds	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
about	1
to	1
mock	1
me	1
if	1
ye	1
really	1
pity	1
me	1
crush	1
sensation	1
and	1
memory	1
let	1
me	1
become	1
as	1
nought	1
but	1
if	1
not	1
depart	1
depart	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
darkness	1
These	1
were	1
wild	1
and	1
miserable	1
thoughts	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
the	1
eternal	1
twinkling	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
weighed	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
every	1
blast	1
of	1
wind	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
dull	1
ugly	1
siroc	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
consume	1
me	1
Morning	1
dawned	1
before	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Chamounix	1
I	1
took	1
no	1
rest	1
but	1
returned	1
immediately	1
to	1
Geneva	1
Even	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
expression	1
to	1
my	1
sensations	1
they	1
weighed	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
mountain	1
s	1
weight	1
and	1
their	1
excess	1
destroyed	1
my	1
agony	1
beneath	1
them	1
Thus	1
I	1
returned	1
home	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
presented	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
My	1
haggard	1
and	1
wild	1
appearance	1
awoke	1
intense	1
alarm	1
but	1
I	1
answered	1
no	1
question	1
scarcely	1
did	1
I	1
speak	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
placed	1
under	1
a	1
ban	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
claim	1
their	1
sympathies	1
as	1
if	1
never	1
more	1
might	1
I	1
enjoy	1
companionship	1
with	1
them	1
Yet	1
even	1
thus	1
I	1
loved	1
them	1
to	1
adoration	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
dedicate	1
myself	1
to	1
my	1
most	1
abhorred	1
task	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
occupation	1
made	1
every	1
other	1
circumstance	1
of	1
existence	1
pass	1
before	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
only	1
had	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
life	1
Chapter	1

Day	1
after	1
day	1
week	1
after	1
week	1
passed	1
away	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
Geneva	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
collect	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
recommence	1
my	1
work	1
I	1
feared	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
disappointed	1
fiend	1
yet	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
overcome	1
my	1
repugnance	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
which	1
was	1
enjoined	1
me	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
compose	1
a	1
female	1
without	1
again	1
devoting	1
several	1
months	1
to	1
profound	1
study	1
and	1
laborious	1
disquisition	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
some	1
discoveries	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
an	1
English	1
philosopher	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
material	1
to	1
my	1
success	1
and	1
I	1
sometimes	1
thought	1
of	1
obtaining	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
consent	1
to	1
visit	1
England	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
but	1
I	1
clung	1
to	1
every	1
pretence	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
shrank	1
from	1
taking	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
in	1
an	1
undertaking	1
whose	1
immediate	1
necessity	1
began	1
to	1
appear	1
less	1
absolute	1
to	1
me	1
A	1
change	1
indeed	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
me	1
my	1
health	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
declined	1
was	1
now	1
much	1
restored	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
when	1
unchecked	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
my	1
unhappy	1
promise	1
rose	1
proportionably	1
My	1
father	1
saw	1
this	1
change	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
thoughts	1
towards	1
the	1
best	1
method	1
of	1
eradicating	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
my	1
melancholy	1
which	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
would	1
return	1
by	1
fits	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
devouring	1
blackness	1
overcast	1
the	1
approaching	1
sunshine	1
At	1
these	1
moments	1
I	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
solitude	1
I	1
passed	1
whole	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
lake	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
watching	1
the	1
clouds	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
rippling	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
silent	1
and	1
listless	1
But	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
and	1
bright	1
sun	1
seldom	1
failed	1
to	1
restore	1
me	1
to	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
I	1
met	1
the	1
salutations	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
with	1
a	1
readier	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
heart	1
It	1
was	1
after	1
my	1
return	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
rambles	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
calling	1
me	1
aside	1
thus	1
addressed	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
to	1
remark	1
my	1
dear	1
son	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
resumed	1
your	1
former	1
pleasures	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
returning	1
to	1
yourself	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
unhappy	1
and	1
still	1
avoid	1
our	1
society	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
conjecture	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
yesterday	1
an	1
idea	1
struck	1
me	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
founded	1
I	1
conjure	1
you	1
to	1
avow	1
it	1
Reserve	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
would	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
useless	1
but	1
draw	1
down	1
treble	1
misery	1
on	1
us	1
all	1
I	1
trembled	1
violently	1
at	1
his	1
exordium	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
continued	1
I	1
confess	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
your	1
marriage	1
with	1
our	1
dear	1
Elizabeth	1
as	1
the	1
tie	1
of	1
our	1
domestic	1
comfort	1
and	1
the	1
stay	1
of	1
my	1
declining	1
years	1
You	1
were	1
attached	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
from	1
your	1
earliest	1
infancy	1
you	1
studied	1
together	1
and	1
appeared	1
in	1
dispositions	1
and	1
tastes	1
entirely	1
suited	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
But	1
so	1
blind	1
is	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
conceived	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
assistants	1
to	1
my	1
plan	1
may	1
have	1
entirely	1
destroyed	1
it	1
You	1
perhaps	1
regard	1
her	1
as	1
your	1
sister	1
without	1
any	1
wish	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
become	1
your	1
wife	1
Nay	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
another	1
whom	1
you	1
may	1
love	1
and	1
considering	1
yourself	1
as	1
bound	1
in	1
honour	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
this	1
struggle	1
may	1
occasion	1
the	1
poignant	1
misery	1
which	1
you	1
appear	1
to	1
feel	1
My	1
dear	1
father	1
reassure	1
yourself	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
cousin	1
tenderly	1
and	1
sincerely	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
any	1
woman	1
who	1
excited	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
does	1
my	1
warmest	1
admiration	1
and	1
affection	1
My	1
future	1
hopes	1
and	1
prospects	1
are	1
entirely	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
our	1
union	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
your	1
sentiments	1
of	1
this	1
subject	1
my	1
dear	1
Victor	1
gives	1
me	1
more	1
pleasure	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
experienced	1
If	1
you	1
feel	1
thus	1
we	1
shall	1
assuredly	1
be	1
happy	1
however	1
present	1
events	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
gloom	1
over	1
us	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
gloom	1
which	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
so	1
strong	1
a	1
hold	1
of	1
your	1
mind	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
dissipate	1
Tell	1
me	1
therefore	1
whether	1
you	1
object	1
to	1
an	1
immediate	1
solemnisation	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
recent	1
events	1
have	1
drawn	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
everyday	1
tranquillity	1
befitting	1
my	1
years	1
and	1
infirmities	1
You	1
are	1
younger	1
yet	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
possessed	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
competent	1
fortune	1
that	1
an	1
early	1
marriage	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
interfere	1
with	1
any	1
future	1
plans	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
utility	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
formed	1
Do	1
not	1
suppose	1
however	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
dictate	1
happiness	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
that	1
a	1
delay	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
would	1
cause	1
me	1
any	1
serious	1
uneasiness	1
Interpret	1
my	1
words	1
with	1
candour	1
and	1
answer	1
me	1
I	1
conjure	1
you	1
with	1
confidence	1
and	1
sincerity	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
incapable	1
of	1
offering	1
any	1
reply	1
I	1
revolved	1
rapidly	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
thoughts	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
some	1
conclusion	1
Alas	1
To	1
me	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
immediate	1
union	1
with	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
dismay	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
by	1
a	1
solemn	1
promise	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
dared	1
not	1
break	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
what	1
manifold	1
miseries	1
might	1
not	1
impend	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
devoted	1
family	1
Could	1
I	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
festival	1
with	1
this	1
deadly	1
weight	1
yet	1
hanging	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
bowing	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
I	1
must	1
perform	1
my	1
engagement	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
monster	1
depart	1
with	1
his	1
mate	1
before	1
I	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
a	1
union	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
expected	1
peace	1
I	1
remembered	1
also	1
the	1
necessity	1
imposed	1
upon	1
me	1
of	1
either	1
journeying	1
to	1
England	1
or	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
correspondence	1
with	1
those	1
philosophers	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
whose	1
knowledge	1
and	1
discoveries	1
were	1
of	1
indispensable	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
present	1
undertaking	1
The	1
latter	1
method	1
of	1
obtaining	1
the	1
desired	1
intelligence	1
was	1
dilatory	1
and	1
unsatisfactory	1
besides	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
insurmountable	1
aversion	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
engaging	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
loathsome	1
task	1
in	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
house	1
while	1
in	1
habits	1
of	1
familiar	1
intercourse	1
with	1
those	1
I	1
loved	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
a	1
thousand	1
fearful	1
accidents	1
might	1
occur	1
the	1
slightest	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
disclose	1
a	1
tale	1
to	1
thrill	1
all	1
connected	1
with	1
me	1
with	1
horror	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
often	1
lose	1
all	1
self	1
command	1
all	1
capacity	1
of	1
hiding	1
the	1
harrowing	1
sensations	1
that	1
would	1
possess	1
me	1
during	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
my	1
unearthly	1
occupation	1
I	1
must	1
absent	1
myself	1
from	1
all	1
I	1
loved	1
while	1
thus	1
employed	1
Once	1
commenced	1
it	1
would	1
quickly	1
be	1
achieved	1
and	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
my	1
family	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness	1
My	1
promise	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
monster	1
would	1
depart	1
for	1
ever	1
Or	1
so	1
my	1
fond	1
fancy	1
imaged	1
some	1
accident	1
might	1
meanwhile	1
occur	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
my	1
slavery	1
for	1
ever	1
These	1
feelings	1
dictated	1
my	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
visit	1
England	1
but	1
concealing	1
the	1
true	1
reasons	1
of	1
this	1
request	1
I	1
clothed	1
my	1
desires	1
under	1
a	1
guise	1
which	1
excited	1
no	1
suspicion	1
while	1
I	1
urged	1
my	1
desire	1
with	1
an	1
earnestness	1
that	1
easily	1
induced	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
comply	1
After	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
an	1
absorbing	1
melancholy	1
that	1
resembled	1
madness	1
in	1
its	1
intensity	1
and	1
effects	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
taking	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
journey	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
change	1
of	1
scene	1
and	1
varied	1
amusement	1
would	1
before	1
my	1
return	1
have	1
restored	1
me	1
entirely	1
to	1
myself	1
The	1
duration	1
of	1
my	1
absence	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
choice	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
or	1
at	1
most	1
a	1
year	1
was	1
the	1
period	1
contemplated	1
One	1
paternal	1
kind	1
precaution	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
ensure	1
my	1
having	1
a	1
companion	1
Without	1
previously	1
communicating	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
concert	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
arranged	1
that	1
Clerval	1
should	1
join	1
me	1
at	1
Strasburgh	1
This	1
interfered	1
with	1
the	1
solitude	1
I	1
coveted	1
for	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
my	1
task	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
could	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
be	1
an	1
impediment	1
and	1
truly	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
thus	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
lonely	1
maddening	1
reflection	1
Nay	1
Henry	1
might	1
stand	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
intrusion	1
of	1
my	1
foe	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
alone	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
at	1
times	1
force	1
his	1
abhorred	1
presence	1
on	1
me	1
to	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
task	1
or	1
to	1
contemplate	1
its	1
progress	1
To	1
England	1
therefore	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
that	1
my	1
union	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
immediately	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
My	1
father	1
s	1
age	1
rendered	1
him	1
extremely	1
averse	1
to	1
delay	1
For	1
myself	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
reward	1
I	1
promised	1
myself	1
from	1
my	1
detested	1
toils	1
one	1
consolation	1
for	1
my	1
unparalleled	1
sufferings	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
enfranchised	1
from	1
my	1
miserable	1
slavery	1
I	1
might	1
claim	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
forget	1
the	1
past	1
in	1
my	1
union	1
with	1
her	1
I	1
now	1
made	1
arrangements	1
for	1
my	1
journey	1
but	1
one	1
feeling	1
haunted	1
me	1
which	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
agitation	1
During	1
my	1
absence	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
my	1
friends	1
unconscious	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
their	1
enemy	1
and	1
unprotected	1
from	1
his	1
attacks	1
exasperated	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
by	1
my	1
departure	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
follow	1
me	1
wherever	1
I	1
might	1
go	1
and	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
accompany	1
me	1
to	1
England	1
This	1
imagination	1
was	1
dreadful	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
soothing	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
supposed	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
I	1
was	1
agonised	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
this	1
might	1
happen	1
But	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
during	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
my	1
creature	1
I	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
the	1
impulses	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
my	1
present	1
sensations	1
strongly	1
intimated	1
that	1
the	1
fiend	1
would	1
follow	1
me	1
and	1
exempt	1
my	1
family	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
his	1
machinations	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
September	1
that	1
I	1
again	1
quitted	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
My	1
journey	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
own	1
suggestion	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
therefore	1
acquiesced	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
disquiet	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
my	1
suffering	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
inroads	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
grief	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
care	1
which	1
provided	1
me	1
a	1
companion	1
in	1
Clerval	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
blind	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
minute	1
circumstances	1
which	1
call	1
forth	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
sedulous	1
attention	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
bid	1
me	1
hasten	1
my	1
return	1
a	1
thousand	1
conflicting	1
emotions	1
rendered	1
her	1
mute	1
as	1
she	1
bade	1
me	1
a	1
tearful	1
silent	1
farewell	1
I	1
threw	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
me	1
away	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
whither	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
careless	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
around	1
I	1
remembered	1
only	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
bitter	1
anguish	1
that	1
I	1
reflected	1
on	1
it	1
to	1
order	1
that	1
my	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
should	1
be	1
packed	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
Filled	1
with	1
dreary	1
imaginations	1
I	1
passed	1
through	1
many	1
beautiful	1
and	1
majestic	1
scenes	1
but	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
and	1
unobserving	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
bourne	1
of	1
my	1
travels	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
occupy	1
me	1
whilst	1
they	1
endured	1
After	1
some	1
days	1
spent	1
in	1
listless	1
indolence	1
during	1
which	1
I	1
traversed	1
many	1
leagues	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
Strasburgh	1
where	1
I	1
waited	1
two	1
days	1
for	1
Clerval	1
He	1
came	1
Alas	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
us	1
He	1
was	1
alive	1
to	1
every	1
new	1
scene	1
joyful	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
and	1
more	1
happy	1
when	1
he	1
beheld	1
it	1
rise	1
and	1
recommence	1
a	1
new	1
day	1
He	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
shifting	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
landscape	1
and	1
the	1
appearances	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
he	1
cried	1
now	1
I	1
enjoy	1
existence	1
But	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
Frankenstein	1
wherefore	1
are	1
you	1
desponding	1
and	1
sorrowful	1
In	1
truth	1
I	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
and	1
neither	1
saw	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
star	1
nor	1
the	1
golden	1
sunrise	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
Rhine	1
And	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
amused	1
with	1
the	1
journal	1
of	1
Clerval	1
who	1
observed	1
the	1
scenery	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
delight	1
than	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
my	1
reflections	1
I	1
a	1
miserable	1
wretch	1
haunted	1
by	1
a	1
curse	1
that	1
shut	1
up	1
every	1
avenue	1
to	1
enjoyment	1
We	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
descend	1
the	1
Rhine	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
from	1
Strasburgh	1
to	1
Rotterdam	1
whence	1
we	1
might	1
take	1
shipping	1
for	1
London	1
During	1
this	1
voyage	1
we	1
passed	1
many	1
willowy	1
islands	1
and	1
saw	1
several	1
beautiful	1
towns	1
We	1
stayed	1
a	1
day	1
at	1
Mannheim	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
from	1
our	1
departure	1
from	1
Strasburgh	1
arrived	1
at	1
Mainz	1
The	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
below	1
Mainz	1
becomes	1
much	1
more	1
picturesque	1
The	1
river	1
descends	1
rapidly	1
and	1
winds	1
between	1
hills	1
not	1
high	1
but	1
steep	1
and	1
of	1
beautiful	1
forms	1
We	1
saw	1
many	1
ruined	1
castles	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
precipices	1
surrounded	1
by	1
black	1
woods	1
high	1
and	1
inaccessible	1
This	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
indeed	1
presents	1
a	1
singularly	1
variegated	1
landscape	1
In	1
one	1
spot	1
you	1
view	1
rugged	1
hills	1
ruined	1
castles	1
overlooking	1
tremendous	1
precipices	1
with	1
the	1
dark	1
Rhine	1
rushing	1
beneath	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
sudden	1
turn	1
of	1
a	1
promontory	1
flourishing	1
vineyards	1
with	1
green	1
sloping	1
banks	1
and	1
a	1
meandering	1
river	1
and	1
populous	1
towns	1
occupy	1
the	1
scene	1
We	1
travelled	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
vintage	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
labourers	1
as	1
we	1
glided	1
down	1
the	1
stream	1
Even	1
I	1
depressed	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
continually	1
agitated	1
by	1
gloomy	1
feelings	1
even	1
I	1
was	1
pleased	1
I	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
gazed	1
on	1
the	1
cloudless	1
blue	1
sky	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
a	1
tranquillity	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
stranger	1
And	1
if	1
these	1
were	1
my	1
sensations	1
who	1
can	1
describe	1
those	1
of	1
Henry	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
transported	1
to	1
Fairy	1
land	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
happiness	1
seldom	1
tasted	1
by	1
man	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
scenes	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
country	1
I	1
have	1
visited	1
the	1
lakes	1
of	1
Lucerne	1
and	1
Uri	1
where	1
the	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
descend	1
almost	1
perpendicularly	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
casting	1
black	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
shades	1
which	1
would	1
cause	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
mournful	1
appearance	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
verdant	1
islands	1
that	1
relieve	1
the	1
eye	1
by	1
their	1
gay	1
appearance	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
lake	1
agitated	1
by	1
a	1
tempest	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
tore	1
up	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
gave	1
you	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
water	1
spout	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
ocean	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
dash	1
with	1
fury	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
where	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
his	1
mistress	1
were	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
an	1
avalanche	1
and	1
where	1
their	1
dying	1
voices	1
are	1
still	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
amid	1
the	1
pauses	1
of	1
the	1
nightly	1
wind	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
La	1
Valais	1
and	1
the	1
Pays	1
de	1
Vaud	1
but	1
this	1
country	1
Victor	1
pleases	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
those	1
wonders	1
The	1
mountains	1
of	1
Switzerland	1
are	1
more	1
majestic	1
and	1
strange	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
charm	1
in	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
this	1
divine	1
river	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
before	1
saw	1
equalled	1
Look	1
at	1
that	1
castle	1
which	1
overhangs	1
yon	1
precipice	1
and	1
that	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
island	1
almost	1
concealed	1
amongst	1
the	1
foliage	1
of	1
those	1
lovely	1
trees	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
group	1
of	1
labourers	1
coming	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
vines	1
and	1
that	1
village	1
half	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
Oh	1
surely	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
inhabits	1
and	1
guards	1
this	1
place	1
has	1
a	1
soul	1
more	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
man	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
pile	1
the	1
glacier	1
or	1
retire	1
to	1
the	1
inaccessible	1
peaks	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
country	1
Clerval	1
Beloved	1
friend	1
Even	1
now	1
it	1
delights	1
me	1
to	1
record	1
your	1
words	1
and	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
eminently	1
deserving	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
being	1
formed	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
poetry	1
of	1
nature	1
His	1
wild	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
imagination	1
was	1
chastened	1
by	1
the	1
sensibility	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
His	1
soul	1
overflowed	1
with	1
ardent	1
affections	1
and	1
his	1
friendship	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
devoted	1
and	1
wondrous	1
nature	1
that	1
the	1
worldly	1
minded	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
But	1
even	1
human	1
sympathies	1
were	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
eager	1
mind	1
The	1
scenery	1
of	1
external	1
nature	1
which	1
others	1
regard	1
only	1
with	1
admiration	1
he	1
loved	1
with	1
ardour	1
The	1
sounding	1
cataract	1
Haunted	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
passion	1
the	1
tall	1
rock	1
The	1
mountain	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
gloomy	1
wood	1
Their	1
colours	1
and	1
their	1
forms	1
were	1
then	1
to	1
him	1
An	1
appetite	1
a	1
feeling	1
and	1
a	1
love	1
That	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
remoter	1
charm	1
By	1
thought	1
supplied	1
or	1
any	1
interest	1
Unborrow	1
d	1
from	1
the	1
eye	1
Wordsworth	1
s	1
Tintern	1
Abbey	1
And	1
where	1
does	1
he	1
now	1
exist	1
Is	1
this	1
gentle	1
and	1
lovely	1
being	1
lost	1
for	1
ever	1
Has	1
this	1
mind	1
so	1
replete	1
with	1
ideas	1
imaginations	1
fanciful	1
and	1
magnificent	1
which	1
formed	1
a	1
world	1
whose	1
existence	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
its	1
creator	1
has	1
this	1
mind	1
perished	1
Does	1
it	1
now	1
only	1
exist	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
No	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
thus	1
your	1
form	1
so	1
divinely	1
wrought	1
and	1
beaming	1
with	1
beauty	1
has	1
decayed	1
but	1
your	1
spirit	1
still	1
visits	1
and	1
consoles	1
your	1
unhappy	1
friend	1
Pardon	1
this	1
gush	1
of	1
sorrow	1
these	1
ineffectual	1
words	1
are	1
but	1
a	1
slight	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
unexampled	1
worth	1
of	1
Henry	1
but	1
they	1
soothe	1
my	1
heart	1
overflowing	1
with	1
the	1
anguish	1
which	1
his	1
remembrance	1
creates	1
I	1
will	1
proceed	1
with	1
my	1
tale	1
Beyond	1
Cologne	1
we	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Holland	1
and	1
we	1
resolved	1
to	1
post	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary	1
and	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
was	1
too	1
gentle	1
to	1
aid	1
us	1
Our	1
journey	1
here	1
lost	1
the	1
interest	1
arising	1
from	1
beautiful	1
scenery	1
but	1
we	1
arrived	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
at	1
Rotterdam	1
whence	1
we	1
proceeded	1
by	1
sea	1
to	1
England	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
clear	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
of	1
December	1
that	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
the	1
white	1
cliffs	1
of	1
Britain	1
The	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Thames	1
presented	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
they	1
were	1
flat	1
but	1
fertile	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
town	1
was	1
marked	1
by	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
some	1
story	1
We	1
saw	1
Tilbury	1
Fort	1
and	1
remembered	1
the	1
Spanish	1
Armada	1
Gravesend	1
Woolwich	1
and	1
Greenwich	1
places	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
country	1
At	1
length	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
numerous	1
steeples	1
of	1
London	1
St	1
Paul	1
s	1
towering	1
above	1
all	1
and	1
the	1
Tower	1
famed	1
in	1
English	1
history	1
Chapter	1
19	1
London	1
was	1
our	1
present	1
point	1
of	1
rest	1
we	1
determined	1
to	1
remain	1
several	1
months	1
in	1
this	1
wonderful	1
and	1
celebrated	1
city	1
Clerval	1
desired	1
the	1
intercourse	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
genius	1
and	1
talent	1
who	1
flourished	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
secondary	1
object	1
I	1
was	1
principally	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
obtaining	1
the	1
information	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
my	1
promise	1
and	1
quickly	1
availed	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
introduction	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
me	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
natural	1
philosophers	1
If	1
this	1
journey	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
during	1
my	1
days	1
of	1
study	1
and	1
happiness	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
afforded	1
me	1
inexpressible	1
pleasure	1
But	1
a	1
blight	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
my	1
existence	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
visited	1
these	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
information	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
interest	1
was	1
so	1
terribly	1
profound	1
Company	1
was	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
alone	1
I	1
could	1
fill	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
the	1
sights	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Henry	1
soothed	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
thus	1
cheat	1
myself	1
into	1
a	1
transitory	1
peace	1
But	1
busy	1
uninteresting	1
joyous	1
faces	1
brought	1
back	1
despair	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
insurmountable	1
barrier	1
placed	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
fellow	1
men	1
this	1
barrier	1
was	1
sealed	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
William	1
and	1
Justine	1
and	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
events	1
connected	1
with	1
those	1
names	1
filled	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
anguish	1
But	1
in	1
Clerval	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
self	1
he	1
was	1
inquisitive	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
gain	1
experience	1
and	1
instruction	1
The	1
difference	1
of	1
manners	1
which	1
he	1
observed	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
source	1
of	1
instruction	1
and	1
amusement	1
He	1
was	1
also	1
pursuing	1
an	1
object	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
His	1
design	1
was	1
to	1
visit	1
India	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
its	1
various	1
languages	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
of	1
its	1
society	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
materially	1
assisting	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
European	1
colonization	1
and	1
trade	1
In	1
Britain	1
only	1
could	1
he	1
further	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
plan	1
He	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
busy	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
check	1
to	1
his	1
enjoyments	1
was	1
my	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
dejected	1
mind	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
this	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
debar	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
pleasures	1
natural	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
entering	1
on	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
of	1
life	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
any	1
care	1
or	1
bitter	1
recollection	1
I	1
often	1
refused	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
alleging	1
another	1
engagement	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
remain	1
alone	1
I	1
now	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
collect	1
the	1
materials	1
necessary	1
for	1
my	1
new	1
creation	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
single	1
drops	1
of	1
water	1
continually	1
falling	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
Every	1
thought	1
that	1
was	1
devoted	1
to	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
extreme	1
anguish	1
and	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
spoke	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
it	1
caused	1
my	1
lips	1
to	1
quiver	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
palpitate	1
After	1
passing	1
some	1
months	1
in	1
London	1
we	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
Scotland	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
our	1
visitor	1
at	1
Geneva	1
He	1
mentioned	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
asked	1
us	1
if	1
those	1
were	1
not	1
sufficient	1
allurements	1
to	1
induce	1
us	1
to	1
prolong	1
our	1
journey	1
as	1
far	1
north	1
as	1
Perth	1
where	1
he	1
resided	1
Clerval	1
eagerly	1
desired	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
invitation	1
and	1
I	1
although	1
I	1
abhorred	1
society	1
wished	1
to	1
view	1
again	1
mountains	1
and	1
streams	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wondrous	1
works	1
with	1
which	1
Nature	1
adorns	1
her	1
chosen	1
dwelling	1
places	1
We	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
England	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
October	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
February	1
We	1
accordingly	1
determined	1
to	1
commence	1
our	1
journey	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
at	1
the	1
expiration	1
of	1
another	1
month	1
In	1
this	1
expedition	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
great	1
road	1
to	1
Edinburgh	1
but	1
to	1
visit	1
Windsor	1
Oxford	1
Matlock	1
and	1
the	1
Cumberland	1
lakes	1
resolving	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
this	1
tour	1
about	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
July	1
I	1
packed	1
up	1
my	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
and	1
the	1
materials	1
I	1
had	1
collected	1
resolving	1
to	1
finish	1
my	1
labours	1
in	1
some	1
obscure	1
nook	1
in	1
the	1
northern	1
highlands	1
of	1
Scotland	1
We	1
quitted	1
London	1
on	1
the	1
27th	1
of	1
March	1
and	1
remained	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
at	1
Windsor	1
rambling	1
in	1
its	1
beautiful	1
forest	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
to	1
us	1
mountaineers	1
the	1
majestic	1
oaks	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
game	1
and	1
the	1
herds	1
of	1
stately	1
deer	1
were	1
all	1
novelties	1
to	1
us	1
From	1
thence	1
we	1
proceeded	1
to	1
Oxford	1
As	1
we	1
entered	1
this	1
city	1
our	1
minds	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
transacted	1
there	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
century	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
before	1
It	1
was	1
here	1
that	1
Charles	1
I	1
had	1
collected	1
his	1
forces	1
This	1
city	1
had	1
remained	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
had	1
forsaken	1
his	1
cause	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
Parliament	1
and	1
liberty	1
The	1
memory	1
of	1
that	1
unfortunate	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
the	1
amiable	1
Falkland	1
the	1
insolent	1
Goring	1
his	1
queen	1
and	1
son	1
gave	1
a	1
peculiar	1
interest	1
to	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
inhabited	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
elder	1
days	1
found	1
a	1
dwelling	1
here	1
and	1
we	1
delighted	1
to	1
trace	1
its	1
footsteps	1
If	1
these	1
feelings	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
an	1
imaginary	1
gratification	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
yet	1
in	1
itself	1
sufficient	1
beauty	1
to	1
obtain	1
our	1
admiration	1
The	1
colleges	1
are	1
ancient	1
and	1
picturesque	1
the	1
streets	1
are	1
almost	1
magnificent	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1
Isis	1
which	1
flows	1
beside	1
it	1
through	1
meadows	1
of	1
exquisite	1
verdure	1
is	1
spread	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
placid	1
expanse	1
of	1
waters	1
which	1
reflects	1
its	1
majestic	1
assemblage	1
of	1
towers	1
and	1
spires	1
and	1
domes	1
embosomed	1
among	1
aged	1
trees	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
this	1
scene	1
and	1
yet	1
my	1
enjoyment	1
was	1
embittered	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
I	1
was	1
formed	1
for	1
peaceful	1
happiness	1
During	1
my	1
youthful	1
days	1
discontent	1
never	1
visited	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
ever	1
overcome	1
by	1
ennui	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
beautiful	1
in	1
nature	1
or	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
excellent	1
and	1
sublime	1
in	1
the	1
productions	1
of	1
man	1
could	1
always	1
interest	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
communicate	1
elasticity	1
to	1
my	1
spirits	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
blasted	1
tree	1
the	1
bolt	1
has	1
entered	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
survive	1
to	1
exhibit	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
miserable	1
spectacle	1
of	1
wrecked	1
humanity	1
pitiable	1
to	1
others	1
and	1
intolerable	1
to	1
myself	1
We	1
passed	1
a	1
considerable	1
period	1
at	1
Oxford	1
rambling	1
among	1
its	1
environs	1
and	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
identify	1
every	1
spot	1
which	1
might	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
animating	1
epoch	1
of	1
English	1
history	1
Our	1
little	1
voyages	1
of	1
discovery	1
were	1
often	1
prolonged	1
by	1
the	1
successive	1
objects	1
that	1
presented	1
themselves	1
We	1
visited	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
the	1
illustrious	1
Hampden	1
and	1
the	1
field	1
on	1
which	1
that	1
patriot	1
fell	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
elevated	1
from	1
its	1
debasing	1
and	1
miserable	1
fears	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
divine	1
ideas	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
self	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
which	1
these	1
sights	1
were	1
the	1
monuments	1
and	1
the	1
remembrancers	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
I	1
dared	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
my	1
chains	1
and	1
look	1
around	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
free	1
and	1
lofty	1
spirit	1
but	1
the	1
iron	1
had	1
eaten	1
into	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
I	1
sank	1
again	1
trembling	1
and	1
hopeless	1
into	1
my	1
miserable	1
self	1
We	1
left	1
Oxford	1
with	1
regret	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
Matlock	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
next	1
place	1
of	1
rest	1
The	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
this	1
village	1
resembled	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
the	1
scenery	1
of	1
Switzerland	1
but	1
everything	1
is	1
on	1
a	1
lower	1
scale	1
and	1
the	1
green	1
hills	1
want	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
distant	1
white	1
Alps	1
which	1
always	1
attend	1
on	1
the	1
piny	1
mountains	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
We	1
visited	1
the	1
wondrous	1
cave	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
cabinets	1
of	1
natural	1
history	1
where	1
the	1
curiosities	1
are	1
disposed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
collections	1
at	1
Servox	1
and	1
Chamounix	1
The	1
latter	1
name	1
made	1
me	1
tremble	1
when	1
pronounced	1
by	1
Henry	1
and	1
I	1
hastened	1
to	1
quit	1
Matlock	1
with	1
which	1
that	1
terrible	1
scene	1
was	1
thus	1
associated	1
From	1
Derby	1
still	1
journeying	1
northwards	1
we	1
passed	1
two	1
months	1
in	1
Cumberland	1
and	1
Westmorland	1
I	1
could	1
now	1
almost	1
fancy	1
myself	1
among	1
the	1
Swiss	1
mountains	1
The	1
little	1
patches	1
of	1
snow	1
which	1
yet	1
lingered	1
on	1
the	1
northern	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
the	1
lakes	1
and	1
the	1
dashing	1
of	1
the	1
rocky	1
streams	1
were	1
all	1
familiar	1
and	1
dear	1
sights	1
to	1
me	1
Here	1
also	1
we	1
made	1
some	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
almost	1
contrived	1
to	1
cheat	1
me	1
into	1
happiness	1
The	1
delight	1
of	1
Clerval	1
was	1
proportionably	1
greater	1
than	1
mine	1
his	1
mind	1
expanded	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
talent	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
nature	1
greater	1
capacities	1
and	1
resources	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
possessed	1
while	1
he	1
associated	1
with	1
his	1
inferiors	1
I	1
could	1
pass	1
my	1
life	1
here	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
among	1
these	1
mountains	1
I	1
should	1
scarcely	1
regret	1
Switzerland	1
and	1
the	1
Rhine	1
But	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
traveller	1
s	1
life	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
includes	1
much	1
pain	1
amidst	1
its	1
enjoyments	1
His	1
feelings	1
are	1
for	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
stretch	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
sink	1
into	1
repose	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
quit	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
rests	1
in	1
pleasure	1
for	1
something	1
new	1
which	1
again	1
engages	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
which	1
also	1
he	1
forsakes	1
for	1
other	1
novelties	1
We	1
had	1
scarcely	1
visited	1
the	1
various	1
lakes	1
of	1
Cumberland	1
and	1
Westmorland	1
and	1
conceived	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
when	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
our	1
appointment	1
with	1
our	1
Scotch	1
friend	1
approached	1
and	1
we	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
travel	1
on	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
I	1
had	1
now	1
neglected	1
my	1
promise	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
I	1
feared	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
s	1
disappointment	1
He	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
Switzerland	1
and	1
wreak	1
his	1
vengeance	1
on	1
my	1
relatives	1
This	1
idea	1
pursued	1
me	1
and	1
tormented	1
me	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
snatched	1
repose	1
and	1
peace	1
I	1
waited	1
for	1
my	1
letters	1
with	1
feverish	1
impatience	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
delayed	1
I	1
was	1
miserable	1
and	1
overcome	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
fears	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
arrived	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
superscription	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
or	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
hardly	1
dared	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
ascertain	1
my	1
fate	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
fiend	1
followed	1
me	1
and	1
might	1
expedite	1
my	1
remissness	1
by	1
murdering	1
my	1
companion	1
When	1
these	1
thoughts	1
possessed	1
me	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
quit	1
Henry	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
followed	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
shadow	1
to	1
protect	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
fancied	1
rage	1
of	1
his	1
destroyer	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
committed	1
some	1
great	1
crime	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
which	1
haunted	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
guiltless	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
indeed	1
drawn	1
down	1
a	1
horrible	1
curse	1
upon	1
my	1
head	1
as	1
mortal	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
crime	1
I	1
visited	1
Edinburgh	1
with	1
languid	1
eyes	1
and	1
mind	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
city	1
might	1
have	1
interested	1
the	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
being	1
Clerval	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
Oxford	1
for	1
the	1
antiquity	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
city	1
was	1
more	1
pleasing	1
to	1
him	1
But	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
regularity	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
town	1
of	1
Edinburgh	1
its	1
romantic	1
castle	1
and	1
its	1
environs	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
Arthur	1
s	1
Seat	1
St	1
Bernard	1
s	1
Well	1
and	1
the	1
Pentland	1
Hills	1
compensated	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
change	1
and	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
cheerfulness	1
and	1
admiration	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
We	1
left	1
Edinburgh	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
passing	1
through	1
Coupar	1
St	1
Andrew	1
s	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Tay	1
to	1
Perth	1
where	1
our	1
friend	1
expected	1
us	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
mood	1
to	1
laugh	1
and	1
talk	1
with	1
strangers	1
or	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
feelings	1
or	1
plans	1
with	1
the	1
good	1
humour	1
expected	1
from	1
a	1
guest	1
and	1
accordingly	1
I	1
told	1
Clerval	1
that	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tour	1
of	1
Scotland	1
alone	1
Do	1
you	1
said	1
I	1
enjoy	1
yourself	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
be	1
our	1
rendezvous	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
absent	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
two	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
interfere	1
with	1
my	1
motions	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
solitude	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
return	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
lighter	1
heart	1
more	1
congenial	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
temper	1
Henry	1
wished	1
to	1
dissuade	1
me	1
but	1
seeing	1
me	1
bent	1
on	1
this	1
plan	1
ceased	1
to	1
remonstrate	1
He	1
entreated	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
often	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
your	1
solitary	1
rambles	1
than	1
with	1
these	1
Scotch	1
people	1
whom	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
hasten	1
then	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
to	1
return	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
again	1
feel	1
myself	1
somewhat	1
at	1
home	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
in	1
your	1
absence	1
Having	1
parted	1
from	1
my	1
friend	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
visit	1
some	1
remote	1
spot	1
of	1
Scotland	1
and	1
finish	1
my	1
work	1
in	1
solitude	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
followed	1
me	1
and	1
would	1
discover	1
himself	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
finished	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
his	1
companion	1
With	1
this	1
resolution	1
I	1
traversed	1
the	1
northern	1
highlands	1
and	1
fixed	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
remotest	1
of	1
the	1
Orkneys	1
as	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
my	1
labours	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
work	1
being	1
hardly	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
rock	1
whose	1
high	1
sides	1
were	1
continually	1
beaten	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
The	1
soil	1
was	1
barren	1
scarcely	1
affording	1
pasture	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
miserable	1
cows	1
and	1
oatmeal	1
for	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
five	1
persons	1
whose	1
gaunt	1
and	1
scraggy	1
limbs	1
gave	1
tokens	1
of	1
their	1
miserable	1
fare	1
Vegetables	1
and	1
bread	1
when	1
they	1
indulged	1
in	1
such	1
luxuries	1
and	1
even	1
fresh	1
water	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
procured	1
from	1
the	1
mainland	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
miles	1
distant	1
On	1
the	1
whole	1
island	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
three	1
miserable	1
huts	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
vacant	1
when	1
I	1
arrived	1
This	1
I	1
hired	1
It	1
contained	1
but	1
two	1
rooms	1
and	1
these	1
exhibited	1
all	1
the	1
squalidness	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
penury	1
The	1
thatch	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
unplastered	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
off	1
its	1
hinges	1
I	1
ordered	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
repaired	1
bought	1
some	1
furniture	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
an	1
incident	1
which	1
would	1
doubtless	1
have	1
occasioned	1
some	1
surprise	1
had	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
senses	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
been	1
benumbed	1
by	1
want	1
and	1
squalid	1
poverty	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
lived	1
ungazed	1
at	1
and	1
unmolested	1
hardly	1
thanked	1
for	1
the	1
pittance	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
clothes	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
so	1
much	1
does	1
suffering	1
blunt	1
even	1
the	1
coarsest	1
sensations	1
of	1
men	1
In	1
this	1
retreat	1
I	1
devoted	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
labour	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
weather	1
permitted	1
I	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
stony	1
beach	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
waves	1
as	1
they	1
roared	1
and	1
dashed	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
monotonous	1
yet	1
ever	1
changing	1
scene	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
Switzerland	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
different	1
from	1
this	1
desolate	1
and	1
appalling	1
landscape	1
Its	1
hills	1
are	1
covered	1
with	1
vines	1
and	1
its	1
cottages	1
are	1
scattered	1
thickly	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
Its	1
fair	1
lakes	1
reflect	1
a	1
blue	1
and	1
gentle	1
sky	1
and	1
when	1
troubled	1
by	1
the	1
winds	1
their	1
tumult	1
is	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
a	1
lively	1
infant	1
when	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
roarings	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
ocean	1
In	1
this	1
manner	1
I	1
distributed	1
my	1
occupations	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
arrived	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
proceeded	1
in	1
my	1
labour	1
it	1
became	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
horrible	1
and	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
myself	1
to	1
enter	1
my	1
laboratory	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
and	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
I	1
toiled	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
complete	1
my	1
work	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
filthy	1
process	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
During	1
my	1
first	1
experiment	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
enthusiastic	1
frenzy	1
had	1
blinded	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
employment	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
intently	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
consummation	1
of	1
my	1
labour	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
proceedings	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
cold	1
blood	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
often	1
sickened	1
at	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
Thus	1
situated	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
detestable	1
occupation	1
immersed	1
in	1
a	1
solitude	1
where	1
nothing	1
could	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
call	1
my	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
actual	1
scene	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
my	1
spirits	1
became	1
unequal	1
I	1
grew	1
restless	1
and	1
nervous	1
Every	1
moment	1
I	1
feared	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
persecutor	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
sat	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
fearing	1
to	1
raise	1
them	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
encounter	1
the	1
object	1
which	1
I	1
so	1
much	1
dreaded	1
to	1
behold	1
I	1
feared	1
to	1
wander	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
lest	1
when	1
alone	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
claim	1
his	1
companion	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
time	1
I	1
worked	1
on	1
and	1
my	1
labour	1
was	1
already	1
considerably	1
advanced	1
I	1
looked	1
towards	1
its	1
completion	1
with	1
a	1
tremulous	1
and	1
eager	1
hope	1
which	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
trust	1
myself	1
to	1
question	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
intermixed	1
with	1
obscure	1
forebodings	1
of	1
evil	1
that	1
made	1
my	1
heart	1
sicken	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
Chapter	1
20	1
I	1
sat	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1
my	1
laboratory	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
set	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
just	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
sufficient	1
light	1
for	1
my	1
employment	1
and	1
I	1
remained	1
idle	1
in	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
consideration	1
of	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
my	1
labour	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
or	1
hasten	1
its	1
conclusion	1
by	1
an	1
unremitting	1
attention	1
to	1
it	1
As	1
I	1
sat	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
reflection	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
which	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
now	1
doing	1
Three	1
years	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
and	1
had	1
created	1
a	1
fiend	1
whose	1
unparalleled	1
barbarity	1
had	1
desolated	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
with	1
the	1
bitterest	1
remorse	1
I	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
form	1
another	1
being	1
of	1
whose	1
dispositions	1
I	1
was	1
alike	1
ignorant	1
she	1
might	1
become	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
more	1
malignant	1
than	1
her	1
mate	1
and	1
delight	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake	1
in	1
murder	1
and	1
wretchedness	1
He	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
deserts	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
and	1
she	1
who	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
was	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
thinking	1
and	1
reasoning	1
animal	1
might	1
refuse	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
a	1
compact	1
made	1
before	1
her	1
creation	1
They	1
might	1
even	1
hate	1
each	1
other	1
the	1
creature	1
who	1
already	1
lived	1
loathed	1
his	1
own	1
deformity	1
and	1
might	1
he	1
not	1
conceive	1
a	1
greater	1
abhorrence	1
for	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
female	1
form	1
She	1
also	1
might	1
turn	1
with	1
disgust	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
superior	1
beauty	1
of	1
man	1
she	1
might	1
quit	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
again	1
alone	1
exasperated	1
by	1
the	1
fresh	1
provocation	1
of	1
being	1
deserted	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
species	1
Even	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
leave	1
Europe	1
and	1
inhabit	1
the	1
deserts	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
world	1
yet	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
results	1
of	1
those	1
sympathies	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
daemon	1
thirsted	1
would	1
be	1
children	1
and	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
devils	1
would	1
be	1
propagated	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
who	1
might	1
make	1
the	1
very	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
man	1
a	1
condition	1
precarious	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
terror	1
Had	1
I	1
right	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
benefit	1
to	1
inflict	1
this	1
curse	1
upon	1
everlasting	1
generations	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
sophisms	1
of	1
the	1
being	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
senseless	1
by	1
his	1
fiendish	1
threats	1
but	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
my	1
promise	1
burst	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
shuddered	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
future	1
ages	1
might	1
curse	1
me	1
as	1
their	1
pest	1
whose	1
selfishness	1
had	1
not	1
hesitated	1
to	1
buy	1
its	1
own	1
peace	1
at	1
the	1
price	1
perhaps	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race	1
I	1
trembled	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
failed	1
within	1
me	1
when	1
on	1
looking	1
up	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
the	1
daemon	1
at	1
the	1
casement	1
A	1
ghastly	1
grin	1
wrinkled	1
his	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
on	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
sat	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
task	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
allotted	1
to	1
me	1
Yes	1
he	1
had	1
followed	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
travels	1
he	1
had	1
loitered	1
in	1
forests	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
caves	1
or	1
taken	1
refuge	1
in	1
wide	1
and	1
desert	1
heaths	1
and	1
he	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
mark	1
my	1
progress	1
and	1
claim	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
my	1
promise	1
As	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
him	1
his	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
the	1
utmost	1
extent	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
treachery	1
I	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
madness	1
on	1
my	1
promise	1
of	1
creating	1
another	1
like	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
trembling	1
with	1
passion	1
tore	1
to	1
pieces	1
the	1
thing	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
The	1
wretch	1
saw	1
me	1
destroy	1
the	1
creature	1
on	1
whose	1
future	1
existence	1
he	1
depended	1
for	1
happiness	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
howl	1
of	1
devilish	1
despair	1
and	1
revenge	1
withdrew	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
locking	1
the	1
door	1
made	1
a	1
solemn	1
vow	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
never	1
to	1
resume	1
my	1
labours	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
trembling	1
steps	1
I	1
sought	1
my	1
own	1
apartment	1
I	1
was	1
alone	1
none	1
were	1
near	1
me	1
to	1
dissipate	1
the	1
gloom	1
and	1
relieve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sickening	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
reveries	1
Several	1
hours	1
passed	1
and	1
I	1
remained	1
near	1
my	1
window	1
gazing	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
motionless	1
for	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
hushed	1
and	1
all	1
nature	1
reposed	1
under	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
moon	1
A	1
few	1
fishing	1
vessels	1
alone	1
specked	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
wafted	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
as	1
the	1
fishermen	1
called	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
silence	1
although	1
I	1
was	1
hardly	1
conscious	1
of	1
its	1
extreme	1
profundity	1
until	1
my	1
ear	1
was	1
suddenly	1
arrested	1
by	1
the	1
paddling	1
of	1
oars	1
near	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
a	1
person	1
landed	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
my	1
door	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
one	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
softly	1
I	1
trembled	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
presentiment	1
of	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
rouse	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
cottage	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
mine	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
helplessness	1
so	1
often	1
felt	1
in	1
frightful	1
dreams	1
when	1
you	1
in	1
vain	1
endeavour	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
an	1
impending	1
danger	1
and	1
was	1
rooted	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
Presently	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
I	1
dreaded	1
appeared	1
Shutting	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
approached	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
smothered	1
voice	1
You	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
you	1
began	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
intend	1
Do	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
break	1
your	1
promise	1
I	1
have	1
endured	1
toil	1
and	1
misery	1
I	1
left	1
Switzerland	1
with	1
you	1
I	1
crept	1
along	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
among	1
its	1
willow	1
islands	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
summits	1
of	1
its	1
hills	1
I	1
have	1
dwelt	1
many	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
heaths	1
of	1
England	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
deserts	1
of	1
Scotland	1
I	1
have	1
endured	1
incalculable	1
fatigue	1
and	1
cold	1
and	1
hunger	1
do	1
you	1
dare	1
destroy	1
my	1
hopes	1
Begone	1
I	1
do	1
break	1
my	1
promise	1
never	1
will	1
I	1
create	1
another	1
like	1
yourself	1
equal	1
in	1
deformity	1
and	1
wickedness	1
Slave	1
I	1
before	1
reasoned	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
proved	1
yourself	1
unworthy	1
of	1
my	1
condescension	1
Remember	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
you	1
believe	1
yourself	1
miserable	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
you	1
so	1
wretched	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
will	1
be	1
hateful	1
to	1
you	1
You	1
are	1
my	1
creator	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
master	1
obey	1
The	1
hour	1
of	1
my	1
irresolution	1
is	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
your	1
power	1
is	1
arrived	1
Your	1
threats	1
cannot	1
move	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
wickedness	1
but	1
they	1
confirm	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
determination	1
of	1
not	1
creating	1
you	1
a	1
companion	1
in	1
vice	1
Shall	1
I	1
in	1
cool	1
blood	1
set	1
loose	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
a	1
daemon	1
whose	1
delight	1
is	1
in	1
death	1
and	1
wretchedness	1
Begone	1
I	1
am	1
firm	1
and	1
your	1
words	1
will	1
only	1
exasperate	1
my	1
rage	1
The	1
monster	1
saw	1
my	1
determination	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
and	1
gnashed	1
his	1
teeth	1
in	1
the	1
impotence	1
of	1
anger	1
Shall	1
each	1
man	1
cried	1
he	1
find	1
a	1
wife	1
for	1
his	1
bosom	1
and	1
each	1
beast	1
have	1
his	1
mate	1
and	1
I	1
be	1
alone	1
I	1
had	1
feelings	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
requited	1
by	1
detestation	1
and	1
scorn	1
Man	1
You	1
may	1
hate	1
but	1
beware	1
Your	1
hours	1
will	1
pass	1
in	1
dread	1
and	1
misery	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
bolt	1
will	1
fall	1
which	1
must	1
ravish	1
from	1
you	1
your	1
happiness	1
for	1
ever	1
Are	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
while	1
I	1
grovel	1
in	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
my	1
wretchedness	1
You	1
can	1
blast	1
my	1
other	1
passions	1
but	1
revenge	1
remains	1
revenge	1
henceforth	1
dearer	1
than	1
light	1
or	1
food	1
I	1
may	1
die	1
but	1
first	1
you	1
my	1
tyrant	1
and	1
tormentor	1
shall	1
curse	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
gazes	1
on	1
your	1
misery	1
Beware	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
fearless	1
and	1
therefore	1
powerful	1
I	1
will	1
watch	1
with	1
the	1
wiliness	1
of	1
a	1
snake	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
sting	1
with	1
its	1
venom	1
Man	1
you	1
shall	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
injuries	1
you	1
inflict	1
Devil	1
cease	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
poison	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
these	1
sounds	1
of	1
malice	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
my	1
resolution	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
coward	1
to	1
bend	1
beneath	1
words	1
Leave	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
inexorable	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
I	1
go	1
but	1
remember	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
I	1
started	1
forward	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
Villain	1
Before	1
you	1
sign	1
my	1
death	1
warrant	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
yourself	1
safe	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
seized	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
me	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
precipitation	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
which	1
shot	1
across	1
the	1
waters	1
with	1
an	1
arrowy	1
swiftness	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
lost	1
amidst	1
the	1
waves	1
All	1
was	1
again	1
silent	1
but	1
his	1
words	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
I	1
burned	1
with	1
rage	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
my	1
peace	1
and	1
precipitate	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ocean	1
I	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
my	1
room	1
hastily	1
and	1
perturbed	1
while	1
my	1
imagination	1
conjured	1
up	1
a	1
thousand	1
images	1
to	1
torment	1
and	1
sting	1
me	1
Why	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
closed	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
mortal	1
strife	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
suffered	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
directed	1
his	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
mainland	1
I	1
shuddered	1
to	1
think	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
victim	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
his	1
insatiate	1
revenge	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
thought	1
again	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
	1
That	1
then	1
was	1
the	1
period	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
my	1
destiny	1
In	1
that	1
hour	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
satisfy	1
and	1
extinguish	1
his	1
malice	1
The	1
prospect	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
me	1
to	1
fear	1
yet	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
Elizabeth	1
of	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
endless	1
sorrow	1
when	1
she	1
should	1
find	1
her	1
lover	1
so	1
barbarously	1
snatched	1
from	1
her	1
tears	1
the	1
first	1
I	1
had	1
shed	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
streamed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
I	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
fall	1
before	1
my	1
enemy	1
without	1
a	1
bitter	1
struggle	1
The	1
night	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
ocean	1
my	1
feelings	1
became	1
calmer	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
calmness	1
when	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
rage	1
sinks	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
despair	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
horrid	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
night	1
s	1
contention	1
and	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
beach	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
I	1
almost	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
insuperable	1
barrier	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
nay	1
a	1
wish	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
prove	1
the	1
fact	1
stole	1
across	1
me	1
I	1
desired	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
pass	1
my	1
life	1
on	1
that	1
barren	1
rock	1
wearily	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
uninterrupted	1
by	1
any	1
sudden	1
shock	1
of	1
misery	1
If	1
I	1
returned	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
or	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
whom	1
I	1
most	1
loved	1
die	1
under	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
a	1
daemon	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
myself	1
created	1
I	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
isle	1
like	1
a	1
restless	1
spectre	1
separated	1
from	1
all	1
it	1
loved	1
and	1
miserable	1
in	1
the	1
separation	1
When	1
it	1
became	1
noon	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
higher	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
awake	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
my	1
nerves	1
were	1
agitated	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
inflamed	1
by	1
watching	1
and	1
misery	1
The	1
sleep	1
into	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
sank	1
refreshed	1
me	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
awoke	1
I	1
again	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
like	1
myself	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
upon	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
with	1
greater	1
composure	1
yet	1
still	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
like	1
a	1
death	1
knell	1
they	1
appeared	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
yet	1
distinct	1
and	1
oppressive	1
as	1
a	1
reality	1
The	1
sun	1
had	1
far	1
descended	1
and	1
I	1
still	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
satisfying	1
my	1
appetite	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
ravenous	1
with	1
an	1
oaten	1
cake	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
fishing	1
boat	1
land	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
packet	1
it	1
contained	1
letters	1
from	1
Geneva	1
and	1
one	1
from	1
Clerval	1
entreating	1
me	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wearing	1
away	1
his	1
time	1
fruitlessly	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
friends	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
in	1
London	1
desired	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
negotiation	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
for	1
his	1
Indian	1
enterprise	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
any	1
longer	1
delay	1
his	1
departure	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
London	1
might	1
be	1
followed	1
even	1
sooner	1
than	1
he	1
now	1
conjectured	1
by	1
his	1
longer	1
voyage	1
he	1
entreated	1
me	1
to	1
bestow	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
my	1
society	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
spare	1
He	1
besought	1
me	1
therefore	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
solitary	1
isle	1
and	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
Perth	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
proceed	1
southwards	1
together	1
This	1
letter	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
recalled	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
quit	1
my	1
island	1
at	1
the	1
expiration	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
Yet	1
before	1
I	1
departed	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
task	1
to	1
perform	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
shuddered	1
to	1
reflect	1
I	1
must	1
pack	1
up	1
my	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
I	1
must	1
enter	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
my	1
odious	1
work	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
handle	1
those	1
utensils	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
sickening	1
to	1
me	1
The	1
next	1
morning	1
at	1
daybreak	1
I	1
summoned	1
sufficient	1
courage	1
and	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
laboratory	1
The	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
finished	1
creature	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
destroyed	1
lay	1
scattered	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
I	1
almost	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
mangled	1
the	1
living	1
flesh	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
I	1
paused	1
to	1
collect	1
myself	1
and	1
then	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber	1
With	1
trembling	1
hand	1
I	1
conveyed	1
the	1
instruments	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
I	1
reflected	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
my	1
work	1
to	1
excite	1
the	1
horror	1
and	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
I	1
accordingly	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
basket	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
laying	1
them	1
up	1
determined	1
to	1
throw	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
that	1
very	1
night	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
I	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
employed	1
in	1
cleaning	1
and	1
arranging	1
my	1
chemical	1
apparatus	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
complete	1
than	1
the	1
alteration	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
feelings	1
since	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
regarded	1
my	1
promise	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
despair	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
with	1
whatever	1
consequences	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
but	1
I	1
now	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
film	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
saw	1
clearly	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
renewing	1
my	1
labours	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
occur	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
threat	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
weighed	1
on	1
my	1
thoughts	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
reflect	1
that	1
a	1
voluntary	1
act	1
of	1
mine	1
could	1
avert	1
it	1
I	1
had	1
resolved	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
to	1
create	1
another	1
like	1
the	1
fiend	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
made	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
basest	1
and	1
most	1
atrocious	1
selfishness	1
and	1
I	1
banished	1
from	1
my	1
mind	1
every	1
thought	1
that	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
conclusion	1
Between	1
two	1
and	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
moon	1
rose	1
and	1
I	1
then	1
putting	1
my	1
basket	1
aboard	1
a	1
little	1
skiff	1
sailed	1
out	1
about	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
The	1
scene	1
was	1
perfectly	1
solitary	1
a	1
few	1
boats	1
were	1
returning	1
towards	1
land	1
but	1
I	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
a	1
dreadful	1
crime	1
and	1
avoided	1
with	1
shuddering	1
anxiety	1
any	1
encounter	1
with	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
the	1
moon	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
clear	1
was	1
suddenly	1
overspread	1
by	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
cast	1
my	1
basket	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
gurgling	1
sound	1
as	1
it	1
sank	1
and	1
then	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
The	1
sky	1
became	1
clouded	1
but	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
pure	1
although	1
chilled	1
by	1
the	1
northeast	1
breeze	1
that	1
was	1
then	1
rising	1
But	1
it	1
refreshed	1
me	1
and	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
agreeable	1
sensations	1
that	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
prolong	1
my	1
stay	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
fixing	1
the	1
rudder	1
in	1
a	1
direct	1
position	1
stretched	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
Clouds	1
hid	1
the	1
moon	1
everything	1
was	1
obscure	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
only	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
as	1
its	1
keel	1
cut	1
through	1
the	1
waves	1
the	1
murmur	1
lulled	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
I	1
slept	1
soundly	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
I	1
remained	1
in	1
this	1
situation	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
awoke	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
already	1
mounted	1
considerably	1
The	1
wind	1
was	1
high	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
continually	1
threatened	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
skiff	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
northeast	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
driven	1
me	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
coast	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
embarked	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
course	1
but	1
quickly	1
found	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
again	1
made	1
the	1
attempt	1
the	1
boat	1
would	1
be	1
instantly	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
Thus	1
situated	1
my	1
only	1
resource	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
few	1
sensations	1
of	1
terror	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
compass	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
slenderly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
geography	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
of	1
little	1
benefit	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
Atlantic	1
and	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
starvation	1
or	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
immeasurable	1
waters	1
that	1
roared	1
and	1
buffeted	1
around	1
me	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
out	1
many	1
hours	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
thirst	1
a	1
prelude	1
to	1
my	1
other	1
sufferings	1
I	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
heavens	1
which	1
were	1
covered	1
by	1
clouds	1
that	1
flew	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
replaced	1
by	1
others	1
I	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
grave	1
Fiend	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
your	1
task	1
is	1
already	1
fulfilled	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
Clerval	1
all	1
left	1
behind	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
monster	1
might	1
satisfy	1
his	1
sanguinary	1
and	1
merciless	1
passions	1
This	1
idea	1
plunged	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
so	1
despairing	1
and	1
frightful	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
scene	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
closing	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
ever	1
I	1
shudder	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
it	1
Some	1
hours	1
passed	1
thus	1
but	1
by	1
degrees	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
declined	1
towards	1
the	1
horizon	1
the	1
wind	1
died	1
away	1
into	1
a	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
free	1
from	1
breakers	1
But	1
these	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
a	1
heavy	1
swell	1
I	1
felt	1
sick	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
rudder	1
when	1
suddenly	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
high	1
land	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
Almost	1
spent	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
the	1
dreadful	1
suspense	1
I	1
endured	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
this	1
sudden	1
certainty	1
of	1
life	1
rushed	1
like	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
warm	1
joy	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
tears	1
gushed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
How	1
mutable	1
are	1
our	1
feelings	1
and	1
how	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
clinging	1
love	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
life	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
misery	1
I	1
constructed	1
another	1
sail	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
dress	1
and	1
eagerly	1
steered	1
my	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
It	1
had	1
a	1
wild	1
and	1
rocky	1
appearance	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
approached	1
nearer	1
I	1
easily	1
perceived	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
cultivation	1
I	1
saw	1
vessels	1
near	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
suddenly	1
transported	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
civilised	1
man	1
I	1
carefully	1
traced	1
the	1
windings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
hailed	1
a	1
steeple	1
which	1
I	1
at	1
length	1
saw	1
issuing	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
small	1
promontory	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
extreme	1
debility	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
sail	1
directly	1
towards	1
the	1
town	1
as	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
most	1
easily	1
procure	1
nourishment	1
Fortunately	1
I	1
had	1
money	1
with	1
me	1
As	1
I	1
turned	1
the	1
promontory	1
I	1
perceived	1
a	1
small	1
neat	1
town	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
harbour	1
which	1
I	1
entered	1
my	1
heart	1
bounding	1
with	1
joy	1
at	1
my	1
unexpected	1
escape	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
fixing	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
arranging	1
the	1
sails	1
several	1
people	1
crowded	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
They	1
seemed	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
my	1
appearance	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
offering	1
me	1
any	1
assistance	1
whispered	1
together	1
with	1
gestures	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time	1
might	1
have	1
produced	1
in	1
me	1
a	1
slight	1
sensation	1
of	1
alarm	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
merely	1
remarked	1
that	1
they	1
spoke	1
English	1
and	1
I	1
therefore	1
addressed	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
language	1
My	1
good	1
friends	1
said	1
I	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
town	1
and	1
inform	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
You	1
will	1
know	1
that	1
soon	1
enough	1
replied	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
Maybe	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
prove	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
taste	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
consulted	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
quarters	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
I	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
surprised	1
on	1
receiving	1
so	1
rude	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
also	1
disconcerted	1
on	1
perceiving	1
the	1
frowning	1
and	1
angry	1
countenances	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
answer	1
me	1
so	1
roughly	1
I	1
replied	1
Surely	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
Englishmen	1
to	1
receive	1
strangers	1
so	1
inhospitably	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
what	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
Irish	1
to	1
hate	1
villains	1
While	1
this	1
strange	1
dialogue	1
continued	1
I	1
perceived	1
the	1
crowd	1
rapidly	1
increase	1
Their	1
faces	1
expressed	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
anger	1
which	1
annoyed	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
alarmed	1
me	1
I	1
inquired	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
replied	1
I	1
then	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
a	1
murmuring	1
sound	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
crowd	1
as	1
they	1
followed	1
and	1
surrounded	1
me	1
when	1
an	1
ill	1
looking	1
man	1
approaching	1
tapped	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
said	1
Come	1
sir	1
you	1
must	1
follow	1
me	1
to	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
s	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
yourself	1
Who	1
is	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
Why	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
myself	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
a	1
free	1
country	1
Ay	1
sir	1
free	1
enough	1
for	1
honest	1
folks	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
is	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
found	1
murdered	1
here	1
last	1
night	1
This	1
answer	1
startled	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
presently	1
recovered	1
myself	1
I	1
was	1
innocent	1
that	1
could	1
easily	1
be	1
proved	1
accordingly	1
I	1
followed	1
my	1
conductor	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
I	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sink	1
from	1
fatigue	1
and	1
hunger	1
but	1
being	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
crowd	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
politic	1
to	1
rouse	1
all	1
my	1
strength	1
that	1
no	1
physical	1
debility	1
might	1
be	1
construed	1
into	1
apprehension	1
or	1
conscious	1
guilt	1
Little	1
did	1
I	1
then	1
expect	1
the	1
calamity	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
me	1
and	1
extinguish	1
in	1
horror	1
and	1
despair	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
ignominy	1
or	1
death	1
I	1
must	1
pause	1
here	1
for	1
it	1
requires	1
all	1
my	1
fortitude	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
frightful	1
events	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
relate	1
in	1
proper	1
detail	1
to	1
my	1
recollection	1
Chapter	1
21	1
I	1
was	1
soon	1
introduced	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate	1
an	1
old	1
benevolent	1
man	1
with	1
calm	1
and	1
mild	1
manners	1
He	1
looked	1
upon	1
me	1
however	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
severity	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
towards	1
my	1
conductors	1
he	1
asked	1
who	1
appeared	1
as	1
witnesses	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
About	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
men	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
one	1
being	1
selected	1
by	1
the	1
magistrate	1
he	1
deposed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
fishing	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
Daniel	1
Nugent	1
when	1
about	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
they	1
observed	1
a	1
strong	1
northerly	1
blast	1
rising	1
and	1
they	1
accordingly	1
put	1
in	1
for	1
port	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
dark	1
night	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
risen	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
land	1
at	1
the	1
harbour	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
at	1
a	1
creek	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
below	1
He	1
walked	1
on	1
first	1
carrying	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fishing	1
tackle	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
followed	1
him	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
proceeding	1
along	1
the	1
sands	1
he	1
struck	1
his	1
foot	1
against	1
something	1
and	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
length	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
His	1
companions	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
their	1
lantern	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
dead	1
Their	1
first	1
supposition	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
some	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
drowned	1
and	1
was	1
thrown	1
on	1
shore	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
but	1
on	1
examination	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
clothes	1
were	1
not	1
wet	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
was	1
not	1
then	1
cold	1
They	1
instantly	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
life	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
handsome	1
young	1
man	1
about	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
He	1
had	1
apparently	1
been	1
strangled	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
violence	1
except	1
the	1
black	1
mark	1
of	1
fingers	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
The	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
deposition	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interest	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
fingers	1
was	1
mentioned	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
felt	1
myself	1
extremely	1
agitated	1
my	1
limbs	1
trembled	1
and	1
a	1
mist	1
came	1
over	1
my	1
eyes	1
which	1
obliged	1
me	1
to	1
lean	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
support	1
The	1
magistrate	1
observed	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
keen	1
eye	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
drew	1
an	1
unfavourable	1
augury	1
from	1
my	1
manner	1
The	1
son	1
confirmed	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
account	1
but	1
when	1
Daniel	1
Nugent	1
was	1
called	1
he	1
swore	1
positively	1
that	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
his	1
companion	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
boat	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
stars	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
boat	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
landed	1
A	1
woman	1
deposed	1
that	1
she	1
lived	1
near	1
the	1
beach	1
and	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
cottage	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
fishermen	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
boat	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
push	1
off	1
from	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
where	1
the	1
corpse	1
was	1
afterwards	1
found	1
Another	1
woman	1
confirmed	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
fishermen	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
body	1
into	1
her	1
house	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
cold	1
They	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
bed	1
and	1
rubbed	1
it	1
and	1
Daniel	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
for	1
an	1
apothecary	1
but	1
life	1
was	1
quite	1
gone	1
Several	1
other	1
men	1
were	1
examined	1
concerning	1
my	1
landing	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
strong	1
north	1
wind	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
probable	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
beaten	1
about	1
for	1
many	1
hours	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
return	1
nearly	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
departed	1
Besides	1
they	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
body	1
from	1
another	1
place	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
likely	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
shore	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
harbour	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
deposited	1
the	1
corpse	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
evidence	1
desired	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
lay	1
for	1
interment	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
observed	1
what	1
effect	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
produce	1
upon	1
me	1
This	1
idea	1
was	1
probably	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
extreme	1
agitation	1
I	1
had	1
exhibited	1
when	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
been	1
described	1
I	1
was	1
accordingly	1
conducted	1
by	1
the	1
magistrate	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
persons	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
coincidences	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
during	1
this	1
eventful	1
night	1
but	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
conversing	1
with	1
several	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
I	1
had	1
inhabited	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
I	1
was	1
perfectly	1
tranquil	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
corpse	1
lay	1
and	1
was	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
coffin	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
describe	1
my	1
sensations	1
on	1
beholding	1
it	1
I	1
feel	1
yet	1
parched	1
with	1
horror	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
reflect	1
on	1
that	1
terrible	1
moment	1
without	1
shuddering	1
and	1
agony	1
The	1
examination	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate	1
and	1
witnesses	1
passed	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
from	1
my	1
memory	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
lifeless	1
form	1
of	1
Henry	1
Clerval	1
stretched	1
before	1
me	1
I	1
gasped	1
for	1
breath	1
and	1
throwing	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
Have	1
my	1
murderous	1
machinations	1
deprived	1
you	1
also	1
my	1
dearest	1
Henry	1
of	1
life	1
Two	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
destroyed	1
other	1
victims	1
await	1
their	1
destiny	1
but	1
you	1
Clerval	1
my	1
friend	1
my	1
benefactor	1
The	1
human	1
frame	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
support	1
the	1
agonies	1
that	1
I	1
endured	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
strong	1
convulsions	1
A	1
fever	1
succeeded	1
to	1
this	1
I	1
lay	1
for	1
two	1
months	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death	1
my	1
ravings	1
as	1
I	1
afterwards	1
heard	1
were	1
frightful	1
I	1
called	1
myself	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
William	1
of	1
Justine	1
and	1
of	1
Clerval	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
entreated	1
my	1
attendants	1
to	1
assist	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
by	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
tormented	1
and	1
at	1
others	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
fingers	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
already	1
grasping	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
screamed	1
aloud	1
with	1
agony	1
and	1
terror	1
Fortunately	1
as	1
I	1
spoke	1
my	1
native	1
language	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
alone	1
understood	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
gestures	1
and	1
bitter	1
cries	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
affright	1
the	1
other	1
witnesses	1
Why	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
die	1
More	1
miserable	1
than	1
man	1
ever	1
was	1
before	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
sink	1
into	1
forgetfulness	1
and	1
rest	1
Death	1
snatches	1
away	1
many	1
blooming	1
children	1
the	1
only	1
hopes	1
of	1
their	1
doting	1
parents	1
how	1
many	1
brides	1
and	1
youthful	1
lovers	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
health	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
a	1
prey	1
for	1
worms	1
and	1
the	1
decay	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
Of	1
what	1
materials	1
was	1
I	1
made	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
thus	1
resist	1
so	1
many	1
shocks	1
which	1
like	1
the	1
turning	1
of	1
the	1
wheel	1
continually	1
renewed	1
the	1
torture	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
doomed	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
months	1
found	1
myself	1
as	1
awaking	1
from	1
a	1
dream	1
in	1
a	1
prison	1
stretched	1
on	1
a	1
wretched	1
bed	1
surrounded	1
by	1
gaolers	1
turnkeys	1
bolts	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
miserable	1
apparatus	1
of	1
a	1
dungeon	1
It	1
was	1
morning	1
I	1
remember	1
when	1
I	1
thus	1
awoke	1
to	1
understanding	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
only	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
great	1
misfortune	1
had	1
suddenly	1
overwhelmed	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
around	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
barred	1
windows	1
and	1
the	1
squalidness	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
all	1
flashed	1
across	1
my	1
memory	1
and	1
I	1
groaned	1
bitterly	1
This	1
sound	1
disturbed	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
sleeping	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
beside	1
me	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
hired	1
nurse	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
turnkeys	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
all	1
those	1
bad	1
qualities	1
which	1
often	1
characterise	1
that	1
class	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
were	1
hard	1
and	1
rude	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
persons	1
accustomed	1
to	1
see	1
without	1
sympathising	1
in	1
sights	1
of	1
misery	1
Her	1
tone	1
expressed	1
her	1
entire	1
indifference	1
she	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
English	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
during	1
my	1
sufferings	1
Are	1
you	1
better	1
now	1
sir	1
said	1
she	1
I	1
replied	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
language	1
with	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
all	1
true	1
if	1
indeed	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dream	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
alive	1
to	1
feel	1
this	1
misery	1
and	1
horror	1
For	1
that	1
matter	1
replied	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
if	1
you	1
mean	1
about	1
the	1
gentleman	1
you	1
murdered	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
dead	1
for	1
I	1
fancy	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
hard	1
with	1
you	1
However	1
that	1
s	1
none	1
of	1
my	1
business	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
nurse	1
you	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
well	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
with	1
a	1
safe	1
conscience	1
it	1
were	1
well	1
if	1
everybody	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
turned	1
with	1
loathing	1
from	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
utter	1
so	1
unfeeling	1
a	1
speech	1
to	1
a	1
person	1
just	1
saved	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
edge	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
I	1
felt	1
languid	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
The	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
dream	1
I	1
sometimes	1
doubted	1
if	1
indeed	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
true	1
for	1
it	1
never	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
reality	1
As	1
the	1
images	1
that	1
floated	1
before	1
me	1
became	1
more	1
distinct	1
I	1
grew	1
feverish	1
a	1
darkness	1
pressed	1
around	1
me	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
near	1
me	1
who	1
soothed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
gentle	1
voice	1
of	1
love	1
no	1
dear	1
hand	1
supported	1
me	1
The	1
physician	1
came	1
and	1
prescribed	1
medicines	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
prepared	1
them	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
utter	1
carelessness	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
brutality	1
was	1
strongly	1
marked	1
in	1
the	1
visage	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
Who	1
could	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
a	1
murderer	1
but	1
the	1
hangman	1
who	1
would	1
gain	1
his	1
fee	1
These	1
were	1
my	1
first	1
reflections	1
but	1
I	1
soon	1
learned	1
that	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
had	1
shown	1
me	1
extreme	1
kindness	1
He	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
best	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
me	1
wretched	1
indeed	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
provided	1
a	1
physician	1
and	1
a	1
nurse	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
he	1
seldom	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
for	1
although	1
he	1
ardently	1
desired	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
every	1
human	1
creature	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
agonies	1
and	1
miserable	1
ravings	1
of	1
a	1
murderer	1
He	1
came	1
therefore	1
sometimes	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
neglected	1
but	1
his	1
visits	1
were	1
short	1
and	1
with	1
long	1
intervals	1
One	1
day	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
gradually	1
recovering	1
I	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
my	1
eyes	1
half	1
open	1
and	1
my	1
cheeks	1
livid	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
death	1
I	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
gloom	1
and	1
misery	1
and	1
often	1
reflected	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
seek	1
death	1
than	1
desire	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
which	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
replete	1
with	1
wretchedness	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
I	1
considered	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
declare	1
myself	1
guilty	1
and	1
suffer	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
less	1
innocent	1
than	1
poor	1
Justine	1
had	1
been	1
Such	1
were	1
my	1
thoughts	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
apartment	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
entered	1
His	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
sympathy	1
and	1
compassion	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
mine	1
and	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
French	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
very	1
shocking	1
to	1
you	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
anything	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
more	1
comfortable	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
mention	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
comfort	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
capable	1
of	1
receiving	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
a	1
stranger	1
can	1
be	1
but	1
of	1
little	1
relief	1
to	1
one	1
borne	1
down	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
by	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
misfortune	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
I	1
hope	1
soon	1
quit	1
this	1
melancholy	1
abode	1
for	1
doubtless	1
evidence	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
free	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
criminal	1
charge	1
That	1
is	1
my	1
least	1
concern	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
strange	1
events	1
become	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
of	1
mortals	1
Persecuted	1
and	1
tortured	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
can	1
death	1
be	1
any	1
evil	1
to	1
me	1
Nothing	1
indeed	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
agonising	1
than	1
the	1
strange	1
chances	1
that	1
have	1
lately	1
occurred	1
You	1
were	1
thrown	1
by	1
some	1
surprising	1
accident	1
on	1
this	1
shore	1
renowned	1
for	1
its	1
hospitality	1
seized	1
immediately	1
and	1
charged	1
with	1
murder	1
The	1
first	1
sight	1
that	1
was	1
presented	1
to	1
your	1
eyes	1
was	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
your	1
friend	1
murdered	1
in	1
so	1
unaccountable	1
a	1
manner	1
and	1
placed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
some	1
fiend	1
across	1
your	1
path	1
As	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
said	1
this	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
agitation	1
I	1
endured	1
on	1
this	1
retrospect	1
of	1
my	1
sufferings	1
I	1
also	1
felt	1
considerable	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
knowledge	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
possess	1
concerning	1
me	1
I	1
suppose	1
some	1
astonishment	1
was	1
exhibited	1
in	1
my	1
countenance	1
for	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
hastened	1
to	1
say	1
Immediately	1
upon	1
your	1
being	1
taken	1
ill	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
your	1
person	1
were	1
brought	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
examined	1
them	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
discover	1
some	1
trace	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
send	1
to	1
your	1
relations	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
your	1
misfortune	1
and	1
illness	1
I	1
found	1
several	1
letters	1
and	1
among	1
others	1
one	1
which	1
I	1
discovered	1
from	1
its	1
commencement	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
your	1
father	1
I	1
instantly	1
wrote	1
to	1
Geneva	1
nearly	1
two	1
months	1
have	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
my	1
letter	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
ill	1
even	1
now	1
you	1
tremble	1
you	1
are	1
unfit	1
for	1
agitation	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
This	1
suspense	1
is	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
event	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
new	1
scene	1
of	1
death	1
has	1
been	1
acted	1
and	1
whose	1
murder	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
to	1
lament	1
Your	1
family	1
is	1
perfectly	1
well	1
said	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
with	1
gentleness	1
and	1
someone	1
a	1
friend	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
visit	1
you	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
by	1
what	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
the	1
idea	1
presented	1
itself	1
but	1
it	1
instantly	1
darted	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
murderer	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
mock	1
at	1
my	1
misery	1
and	1
taunt	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Clerval	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
incitement	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
hellish	1
desires	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
hand	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
agony	1
Oh	1
Take	1
him	1
away	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
him	1
for	1
God	1
s	1
sake	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
enter	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
regarded	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
troubled	1
countenance	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
regarding	1
my	1
exclamation	1
as	1
a	1
presumption	1
of	1
my	1
guilt	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
severe	1
tone	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
welcome	1
instead	1
of	1
inspiring	1
such	1
violent	1
repugnance	1
My	1
father	1
cried	1
I	1
while	1
every	1
feature	1
and	1
every	1
muscle	1
was	1
relaxed	1
from	1
anguish	1
to	1
pleasure	1
Is	1
my	1
father	1
indeed	1
come	1
How	1
kind	1
how	1
very	1
kind	1
But	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
not	1
hasten	1
to	1
me	1
My	1
change	1
of	1
manner	1
surprised	1
and	1
pleased	1
the	1
magistrate	1
perhaps	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
former	1
exclamation	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
return	1
of	1
delirium	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
instantly	1
resumed	1
his	1
former	1
benevolence	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
my	1
nurse	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
it	1
Nothing	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
than	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
stretched	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
cried	1
Are	1
you	1
then	1
safe	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Ernest	1
My	1
father	1
calmed	1
me	1
with	1
assurances	1
of	1
their	1
welfare	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
these	1
subjects	1
so	1
interesting	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
raise	1
my	1
desponding	1
spirits	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
prison	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
abode	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
What	1
a	1
place	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
you	1
inhabit	1
my	1
son	1
said	1
he	1
looking	1
mournfully	1
at	1
the	1
barred	1
windows	1
and	1
wretched	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
You	1
travelled	1
to	1
seek	1
happiness	1
but	1
a	1
fatality	1
seems	1
to	1
pursue	1
you	1
And	1
poor	1
Clerval	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
murdered	1
friend	1
was	1
an	1
agitation	1
too	1
great	1
to	1
be	1
endured	1
in	1
my	1
weak	1
state	1
I	1
shed	1
tears	1
Alas	1
Yes	1
my	1
father	1
replied	1
I	1
some	1
destiny	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
kind	1
hangs	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
live	1
to	1
fulfil	1
it	1
or	1
surely	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
died	1
on	1
the	1
coffin	1
of	1
Henry	1
We	1
were	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
converse	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
precarious	1
state	1
of	1
my	1
health	1
rendered	1
every	1
precaution	1
necessary	1
that	1
could	1
ensure	1
tranquillity	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
insisted	1
that	1
my	1
strength	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
exhausted	1
by	1
too	1
much	1
exertion	1
But	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
angel	1
and	1
I	1
gradually	1
recovered	1
my	1
health	1
As	1
my	1
sickness	1
quitted	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
absorbed	1
by	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
black	1
melancholy	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
dissipate	1
The	1
image	1
of	1
Clerval	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
me	1
ghastly	1
and	1
murdered	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
the	1
agitation	1
into	1
which	1
these	1
reflections	1
threw	1
me	1
made	1
my	1
friends	1
dread	1
a	1
dangerous	1
relapse	1
Alas	1
Why	1
did	1
they	1
preserve	1
so	1
miserable	1
and	1
detested	1
a	1
life	1
It	1
was	1
surely	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
fulfil	1
my	1
destiny	1
which	1
is	1
now	1
drawing	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
Soon	1
oh	1
very	1
soon	1
will	1
death	1
extinguish	1
these	1
throbbings	1
and	1
relieve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
mighty	1
weight	1
of	1
anguish	1
that	1
bears	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
in	1
executing	1
the	1
award	1
of	1
justice	1
I	1
shall	1
also	1
sink	1
to	1
rest	1
Then	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
death	1
was	1
distant	1
although	1
the	1
wish	1
was	1
ever	1
present	1
to	1
my	1
thoughts	1
and	1
I	1
often	1
sat	1
for	1
hours	1
motionless	1
and	1
speechless	1
wishing	1
for	1
some	1
mighty	1
revolution	1
that	1
might	1
bury	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
destroyer	1
in	1
its	1
ruins	1
The	1
season	1
of	1
the	1
assizes	1
approached	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
prison	1
and	1
although	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
weak	1
and	1
in	1
continual	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
relapse	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
travel	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
miles	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
town	1
where	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
held	1
Mr	1
Kirwin	1
charged	1
himself	1
with	1
every	1
care	1
of	1
collecting	1
witnesses	1
and	1
arranging	1
my	1
defence	1
I	1
was	1
spared	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
appearing	1
publicly	1
as	1
a	1
criminal	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
not	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
court	1
that	1
decides	1
on	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
The	1
grand	1
jury	1
rejected	1
the	1
bill	1
on	1
its	1
being	1
proved	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
Orkney	1
Islands	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
was	1
found	1
and	1
a	1
fortnight	1
after	1
my	1
removal	1
I	1
was	1
liberated	1
from	1
prison	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
enraptured	1
on	1
finding	1
me	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
vexations	1
of	1
a	1
criminal	1
charge	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
again	1
allowed	1
to	1
breathe	1
the	1
fresh	1
atmosphere	1
and	1
permitted	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
participate	1
in	1
these	1
feelings	1
for	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
dungeon	1
or	1
a	1
palace	1
were	1
alike	1
hateful	1
The	1
cup	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
poisoned	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
upon	1
the	1
happy	1
and	1
gay	1
of	1
heart	1
I	1
saw	1
around	1
me	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
dense	1
and	1
frightful	1
darkness	1
penetrated	1
by	1
no	1
light	1
but	1
the	1
glimmer	1
of	1
two	1
eyes	1
that	1
glared	1
upon	1
me	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
expressive	1
eyes	1
of	1
Henry	1
languishing	1
in	1
death	1
the	1
dark	1
orbs	1
nearly	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
lids	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
black	1
lashes	1
that	1
fringed	1
them	1
sometimes	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
watery	1
clouded	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
as	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
chamber	1
at	1
Ingolstadt	1
My	1
father	1
tried	1
to	1
awaken	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
affection	1
He	1
talked	1
of	1
Geneva	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
visit	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Ernest	1
but	1
these	1
words	1
only	1
drew	1
deep	1
groans	1
from	1
me	1
Sometimes	1
indeed	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
for	1
happiness	1
and	1
thought	1
with	1
melancholy	1
delight	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
cousin	1
or	1
longed	1
with	1
a	1
devouring	1
maladie	1
du	1
pays	1
to	1
see	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
blue	1
lake	1
and	1
rapid	1
Rhone	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
early	1
childhood	1
but	1
my	1
general	1
state	1
of	1
feeling	1
was	1
a	1
torpor	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
prison	1
was	1
as	1
welcome	1
a	1
residence	1
as	1
the	1
divinest	1
scene	1
in	1
nature	1
and	1
these	1
fits	1
were	1
seldom	1
interrupted	1
but	1
by	1
paroxysms	1
of	1
anguish	1
and	1
despair	1
At	1
these	1
moments	1
I	1
often	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
I	1
loathed	1
and	1
it	1
required	1
unceasing	1
attendance	1
and	1
vigilance	1
to	1
restrain	1
me	1
from	1
committing	1
some	1
dreadful	1
act	1
of	1
violence	1
Yet	1
one	1
duty	1
remained	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
which	1
finally	1
triumphed	1
over	1
my	1
selfish	1
despair	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
return	1
without	1
delay	1
to	1
Geneva	1
there	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
those	1
I	1
so	1
fondly	1
loved	1
and	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
murderer	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
chance	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
concealment	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
dared	1
again	1
to	1
blast	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
presence	1
I	1
might	1
with	1
unfailing	1
aim	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
monstrous	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
endued	1
with	1
the	1
mockery	1
of	1
a	1
soul	1
still	1
more	1
monstrous	1
My	1
father	1
still	1
desired	1
to	1
delay	1
our	1
departure	1
fearful	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
sustain	1
the	1
fatigues	1
of	1
a	1
journey	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
shattered	1
wreck	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
My	1
strength	1
was	1
gone	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
skeleton	1
and	1
fever	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
preyed	1
upon	1
my	1
wasted	1
frame	1
Still	1
as	1
I	1
urged	1
our	1
leaving	1
Ireland	1
with	1
such	1
inquietude	1
and	1
impatience	1
my	1
father	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
yield	1
We	1
took	1
our	1
passage	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
vessel	1
bound	1
for	1
Havre	1
de	1
Grace	1
and	1
sailed	1
with	1
a	1
fair	1
wind	1
from	1
the	1
Irish	1
shores	1
It	1
was	1
midnight	1
I	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
dashing	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
I	1
hailed	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
shut	1
Ireland	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
and	1
my	1
pulse	1
beat	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
joy	1
when	1
I	1
reflected	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
see	1
Geneva	1
The	1
past	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
frightful	1
dream	1
yet	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
blew	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
detested	1
shore	1
of	1
Ireland	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
surrounded	1
me	1
told	1
me	1
too	1
forcibly	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
deceived	1
by	1
no	1
vision	1
and	1
that	1
Clerval	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
dearest	1
companion	1
had	1
fallen	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
monster	1
of	1
my	1
creation	1
I	1
repassed	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
my	1
whole	1
life	1
my	1
quiet	1
happiness	1
while	1
residing	1
with	1
my	1
family	1
in	1
Geneva	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
departure	1
for	1
Ingolstadt	1
I	1
remembered	1
shuddering	1
the	1
mad	1
enthusiasm	1
that	1
hurried	1
me	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
my	1
hideous	1
enemy	1
and	1
I	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
first	1
lived	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
a	1
thousand	1
feelings	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
wept	1
bitterly	1
Ever	1
since	1
my	1
recovery	1
from	1
the	1
fever	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
taking	1
every	1
night	1
a	1
small	1
quantity	1
of	1
laudanum	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
this	1
drug	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
enabled	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
rest	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
life	1
Oppressed	1
by	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
my	1
various	1
misfortunes	1
I	1
now	1
swallowed	1
double	1
my	1
usual	1
quantity	1
and	1
soon	1
slept	1
profoundly	1
But	1
sleep	1
did	1
not	1
afford	1
me	1
respite	1
from	1
thought	1
and	1
misery	1
my	1
dreams	1
presented	1
a	1
thousand	1
objects	1
that	1
scared	1
me	1
Towards	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
nightmare	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
fiend	1
s	1
grasp	1
in	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
free	1
myself	1
from	1
it	1
groans	1
and	1
cries	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
My	1
father	1
who	1
was	1
watching	1
over	1
me	1
perceiving	1
my	1
restlessness	1
awoke	1
me	1
the	1
dashing	1
waves	1
were	1
around	1
the	1
cloudy	1
sky	1
above	1
the	1
fiend	1
was	1
not	1
here	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
security	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
a	1
truce	1
was	1
established	1
between	1
the	1
present	1
hour	1
and	1
the	1
irresistible	1
disastrous	1
future	1
imparted	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
calm	1
forgetfulness	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
is	1
by	1
its	1
structure	1
peculiarly	1
susceptible	1
Chapter	1
22	1
The	1
voyage	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
We	1
landed	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
Paris	1
I	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
overtaxed	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
repose	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
continue	1
my	1
journey	1
My	1
father	1
s	1
care	1
and	1
attentions	1
were	1
indefatigable	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
my	1
sufferings	1
and	1
sought	1
erroneous	1
methods	1
to	1
remedy	1
the	1
incurable	1
ill	1
He	1
wished	1
me	1
to	1
seek	1
amusement	1
in	1
society	1
I	1
abhorred	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
man	1
Oh	1
not	1
abhorred	1
They	1
were	1
my	1
brethren	1
my	1
fellow	1
beings	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
attracted	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
repulsive	1
among	1
them	1
as	1
to	1
creatures	1
of	1
an	1
angelic	1
nature	1
and	1
celestial	1
mechanism	1
But	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
share	1
their	1
intercourse	1
I	1
had	1
unchained	1
an	1
enemy	1
among	1
them	1
whose	1
joy	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
shed	1
their	1
blood	1
and	1
to	1
revel	1
in	1
their	1
groans	1
How	1
they	1
would	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
abhor	1
me	1
and	1
hunt	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
did	1
they	1
know	1
my	1
unhallowed	1
acts	1
and	1
the	1
crimes	1
which	1
had	1
their	1
source	1
in	1
me	1
My	1
father	1
yielded	1
at	1
length	1
to	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
avoid	1
society	1
and	1
strove	1
by	1
various	1
arguments	1
to	1
banish	1
my	1
despair	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
deeply	1
the	1
degradation	1
of	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
answer	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
murder	1
and	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
futility	1
of	1
pride	1
Alas	1
My	1
father	1
said	1
I	1
how	1
little	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
me	1
Human	1
beings	1
their	1
feelings	1
and	1
passions	1
would	1
indeed	1
be	1
degraded	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
wretch	1
as	1
I	1
felt	1
pride	1
Justine	1
poor	1
unhappy	1
Justine	1
was	1
as	1
innocent	1
as	1
I	1
and	1
she	1
suffered	1
the	1
same	1
charge	1
she	1
died	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
murdered	1
her	1
William	1
Justine	1
and	1
Henry	1
they	1
all	1
died	1
by	1
my	1
hands	1
My	1
father	1
had	1
often	1
during	1
my	1
imprisonment	1
heard	1
me	1
make	1
the	1
same	1
assertion	1
when	1
I	1
thus	1
accused	1
myself	1
he	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
to	1
desire	1
an	1
explanation	1
and	1
at	1
others	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
delirium	1
and	1
that	1
during	1
my	1
illness	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
had	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
imagination	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
preserved	1
in	1
my	1
convalescence	1
I	1
avoided	1
explanation	1
and	1
maintained	1
a	1
continual	1
silence	1
concerning	1
the	1
wretch	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
persuasion	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
supposed	1
mad	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
itself	1
would	1
for	1
ever	1
have	1
chained	1
my	1
tongue	1
But	1
besides	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
disclose	1
a	1
secret	1
which	1
would	1
fill	1
my	1
hearer	1
with	1
consternation	1
and	1
make	1
fear	1
and	1
unnatural	1
horror	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
his	1
breast	1
I	1
checked	1
therefore	1
my	1
impatient	1
thirst	1
for	1
sympathy	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
have	1
confided	1
the	1
fatal	1
secret	1
Yet	1
still	1
words	1
like	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
recorded	1
would	1
burst	1
uncontrollably	1
from	1
me	1
I	1
could	1
offer	1
no	1
explanation	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
their	1
truth	1
in	1
part	1
relieved	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
my	1
mysterious	1
woe	1
Upon	1
this	1
occasion	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
unbounded	1
wonder	1
My	1
dearest	1
Victor	1
what	1
infatuation	1
is	1
this	1
My	1
dear	1
son	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
assertion	1
again	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mad	1
I	1
cried	1
energetically	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
who	1
have	1
viewed	1
my	1
operations	1
can	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
my	1
truth	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
assassin	1
of	1
those	1
most	1
innocent	1
victims	1
they	1
died	1
by	1
my	1
machinations	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
shed	1
my	1
own	1
blood	1
drop	1
by	1
drop	1
to	1
have	1
saved	1
their	1
lives	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
my	1
father	1
indeed	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race	1
The	1
conclusion	1
of	1
this	1
speech	1
convinced	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
my	1
ideas	1
were	1
deranged	1
and	1
he	1
instantly	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
conversation	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
alter	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
thoughts	1
He	1
wished	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
obliterate	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
scenes	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
Ireland	1
and	1
never	1
alluded	1
to	1
them	1
or	1
suffered	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
As	1
time	1
passed	1
away	1
I	1
became	1
more	1
calm	1
misery	1
had	1
her	1
dwelling	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
but	1
I	1
no	1
longer	1
talked	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
incoherent	1
manner	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
crimes	1
sufficient	1
for	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
them	1
By	1
the	1
utmost	1
self	1
violence	1
I	1
curbed	1
the	1
imperious	1
voice	1
of	1
wretchedness	1
which	1
sometimes	1
desired	1
to	1
declare	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
and	1
my	1
manners	1
were	1
calmer	1
and	1
more	1
composed	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
since	1
my	1
journey	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
we	1
left	1
Paris	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
Switzerland	1
I	1
received	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
from	1
Elizabeth	1
My	1
dear	1
Friend	1
It	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
uncle	1
dated	1
at	1
Paris	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
at	1
a	1
formidable	1
distance	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
fortnight	1
My	1
poor	1
cousin	1
how	1
much	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
I	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
looking	1
even	1
more	1
ill	1
than	1
when	1
you	1
quitted	1
Geneva	1
This	1
winter	1
has	1
been	1
passed	1
most	1
miserably	1
tortured	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
anxious	1
suspense	1
yet	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
countenance	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
your	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
totally	1
void	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
Yet	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
now	1
exist	1
that	1
made	1
you	1
so	1
miserable	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
even	1
perhaps	1
augmented	1
by	1
time	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
disturb	1
you	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
when	1
so	1
many	1
misfortunes	1
weigh	1
upon	1
you	1
but	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
with	1
my	1
uncle	1
previous	1
to	1
his	1
departure	1
renders	1
some	1
explanation	1
necessary	1
before	1
we	1
meet	1
Explanation	1
You	1
may	1
possibly	1
say	1
What	1
can	1
Elizabeth	1
have	1
to	1
explain	1
If	1
you	1
really	1
say	1
this	1
my	1
questions	1
are	1
answered	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
doubts	1
satisfied	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
distant	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
dread	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
explanation	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
probability	1
of	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
any	1
longer	1
postpone	1
writing	1
what	1
during	1
your	1
absence	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
wished	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
begin	1
You	1
well	1
know	1
Victor	1
that	1
our	1
union	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
plan	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
ever	1
since	1
our	1
infancy	1
We	1
were	1
told	1
this	1
when	1
young	1
and	1
taught	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
event	1
that	1
would	1
certainly	1
take	1
place	1
We	1
were	1
affectionate	1
playfellows	1
during	1
childhood	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
dear	1
and	1
valued	1
friends	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
we	1
grew	1
older	1
But	1
as	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
often	1
entertain	1
a	1
lively	1
affection	1
towards	1
each	1
other	1
without	1
desiring	1
a	1
more	1
intimate	1
union	1
may	1
not	1
such	1
also	1
be	1
our	1
case	1
Tell	1
me	1
dearest	1
Victor	1
Answer	1
me	1
I	1
conjure	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
mutual	1
happiness	1
with	1
simple	1
truth	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
love	1
another	1
You	1
have	1
travelled	1
you	1
have	1
spent	1
several	1
years	1
of	1
your	1
life	1
at	1
Ingolstadt	1
and	1
I	1
confess	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
last	1
autumn	1
so	1
unhappy	1
flying	1
to	1
solitude	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
every	1
creature	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
supposing	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
regret	1
our	1
connection	1
and	1
believe	1
yourself	1
bound	1
in	1
honour	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
although	1
they	1
opposed	1
themselves	1
to	1
your	1
inclinations	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
false	1
reasoning	1
I	1
confess	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
airy	1
dreams	1
of	1
futurity	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
constant	1
friend	1
and	1
companion	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
happiness	1
I	1
desire	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
when	1
I	1
declare	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
our	1
marriage	1
would	1
render	1
me	1
eternally	1
miserable	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
dictate	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
free	1
choice	1
Even	1
now	1
I	1
weep	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
borne	1
down	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
by	1
the	1
cruellest	1
misfortunes	1
you	1
may	1
stifle	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
honour	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
and	1
happiness	1
which	1
would	1
alone	1
restore	1
you	1
to	1
yourself	1
I	1
who	1
have	1
so	1
disinterested	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
you	1
may	1
increase	1
your	1
miseries	1
tenfold	1
by	1
being	1
an	1
obstacle	1
to	1
your	1
wishes	1
Ah	1
Victor	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
your	1
cousin	1
and	1
playmate	1
has	1
too	1
sincere	1
a	1
love	1
for	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
miserable	1
by	1
this	1
supposition	1
Be	1
happy	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
obey	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
one	1
request	1
remain	1
satisfied	1
that	1
nothing	1
on	1
earth	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
interrupt	1
my	1
tranquillity	1
Do	1
not	1
let	1
this	1
letter	1
disturb	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
answer	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
or	1
even	1
until	1
you	1

it	1

you	1

My	1
uncle	1
will	1

me	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
health	1

if	1
I	1
see	1
but	1
one	1
smile	1
on	1
your	1
lips	1
when	1
we	1
meet	1
occasioned	1
by	1
this	1
or	1
any	1
other	1

mine	1

shall	1
need	1
no	1
other	1

This	1
letter	1
revived	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
forgotten	1
the	1
threat	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
	1
Such	1
was	1
my	1
sentence	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
night	1
would	1
the	1
daemon	1
employ	1
every	1
art	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
and	1
tear	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
glimpse	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
promised	1
partly	1
to	1
console	1
my	1
sufferings	1
On	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
consummate	1
his	1
crimes	1
by	1
my	1
death	1
Well	1
be	1
it	1
so	1
a	1
deadly	1
struggle	1
would	1
then	1
assuredly	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
which	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
victorious	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
his	1
power	1
over	1
me	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
vanquished	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
free	1
man	1
Alas	1
What	1
freedom	1
Such	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
enjoys	1
when	1
his	1
family	1
have	1
been	1
massacred	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
his	1
cottage	1
burnt	1
his	1
lands	1
laid	1
waste	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
turned	1
adrift	1
homeless	1
penniless	1
and	1
alone	1
but	1
free	1
Such	1
would	1
be	1
my	1
liberty	1
except	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
possessed	1
a	1
treasure	1
alas	1
balanced	1
by	1
those	1
horrors	1
of	1
remorse	1
and	1
guilt	1
which	1
would	1
pursue	1
me	1
until	1
death	1
Sweet	1
and	1
beloved	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
read	1
and	1
reread	1
her	1
letter	1
and	1
some	1
softened	1
feelings	1
stole	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
dared	1
to	1
whisper	1
paradisiacal	1
dreams	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
joy	1
but	1
the	1
apple	1
was	1
already	1
eaten	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
s	1
arm	1
bared	1
to	1
drive	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
hope	1
Yet	1
I	1
would	1
die	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
happy	1
If	1
the	1
monster	1
executed	1
his	1
threat	1
death	1
was	1
inevitable	1
yet	1
again	1
I	1
considered	1
whether	1
my	1
marriage	1
would	1
hasten	1
my	1
fate	1
My	1
destruction	1
might	1
indeed	1
arrive	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
sooner	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
torturer	1
should	1
suspect	1
that	1
I	1
postponed	1
it	1
influenced	1
by	1
his	1
menaces	1
he	1
would	1
surely	1
find	1
other	1
and	1
perhaps	1
more	1
dreadful	1
means	1
of	1
revenge	1
He	1
had	1
vowed	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
wedding	1
night	1
yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
threat	1
as	1
binding	1
him	1
to	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
for	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
satiated	1
with	1
blood	1
he	1
had	1
murdered	1
Clerval	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
enunciation	1
of	1
his	1
threats	1
I	1
resolved	1
therefore	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
immediate	1
union	1
with	1
my	1
cousin	1
would	1
conduce	1
either	1
to	1
hers	1
or	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
happiness	1
my	1
adversary	1
s	1
designs	1
against	1
my	1
life	1
should	1
not	1
retard	1
it	1
a	1
single	1
hour	1
In	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
My	1
letter	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
affectionate	1
I	1
fear	1
my	1
beloved	1
girl	1
I	1
said	1
little	1
happiness	1
remains	1
for	1
us	1
on	1
earth	1
yet	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
one	1
day	1
enjoy	1
is	1
centred	1
in	1
you	1
Chase	1
away	1
your	1
idle	1
fears	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
do	1
I	1
consecrate	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
endeavours	1
for	1
contentment	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
secret	1
Elizabeth	1
a	1
dreadful	1
one	1
when	1
revealed	1
to	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
chill	1
your	1
frame	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
then	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
surprised	1
at	1
my	1
misery	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
I	1
survive	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
endured	1
I	1
will	1
confide	1
this	1
tale	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
terror	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
our	1
marriage	1
shall	1
take	1
place	1
for	1
my	1
sweet	1
cousin	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
perfect	1
confidence	1
between	1
us	1
But	1
until	1
then	1
I	1
conjure	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
mention	1
or	1
allude	1
to	1
it	1
This	1
I	1
most	1
earnestly	1
entreat	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
comply	1
In	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
letter	1
we	1
returned	1
to	1
Geneva	1
The	1
sweet	1
girl	1
welcomed	1
me	1
with	1
warm	1
affection	1
yet	1
tears	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
beheld	1
my	1
emaciated	1
frame	1
and	1
feverish	1
cheeks	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
also	1
She	1
was	1
thinner	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
heavenly	1
vivacity	1
that	1
had	1
before	1
charmed	1
me	1
but	1
her	1
gentleness	1
and	1
soft	1
looks	1
of	1
compassion	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
more	1
fit	1
companion	1
for	1
one	1
blasted	1
and	1
miserable	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
The	1
tranquillity	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
enjoyed	1
did	1
not	1
endure	1
Memory	1
brought	1
madness	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
real	1
insanity	1
possessed	1
me	1
sometimes	1
I	1
was	1
furious	1
and	1
burnt	1
with	1
rage	1
sometimes	1
low	1
and	1
despondent	1
I	1
neither	1
spoke	1
nor	1
looked	1
at	1
anyone	1
but	1
sat	1
motionless	1
bewildered	1
by	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
miseries	1
that	1
overcame	1
me	1
Elizabeth	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
draw	1
me	1
from	1
these	1
fits	1
her	1
gentle	1
voice	1
would	1
soothe	1
me	1
when	1
transported	1
by	1
passion	1
and	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
human	1
feelings	1
when	1
sunk	1
in	1
torpor	1
She	1
wept	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
When	1
reason	1
returned	1
she	1
would	1
remonstrate	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
resignation	1
Ah	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
to	1
be	1
resigned	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
guilty	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace	1
The	1
agonies	1
of	1
remorse	1
poison	1
the	1
luxury	1
there	1
is	1
otherwise	1
sometimes	1
found	1
in	1
indulging	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
grief	1
Soon	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
my	1
father	1
spoke	1
of	1
my	1
immediate	1
marriage	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
I	1
remained	1
silent	1
Have	1
you	1
then	1
some	1
other	1
attachment	1
None	1
on	1
earth	1
I	1
love	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
our	1
union	1
with	1
delight	1
Let	1
the	1
day	1
therefore	1
be	1
fixed	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
consecrate	1
myself	1
in	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
my	1
cousin	1
My	1
dear	1
Victor	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
thus	1
Heavy	1
misfortunes	1
have	1
befallen	1
us	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
only	1
cling	1
closer	1
to	1
what	1
remains	1
and	1
transfer	1
our	1
love	1
for	1
those	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
lost	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
yet	1
live	1
Our	1
circle	1
will	1
be	1
small	1
but	1
bound	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
ties	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
mutual	1
misfortune	1
And	1
when	1
time	1
shall	1
have	1
softened	1
your	1
despair	1
new	1
and	1
dear	1
objects	1
of	1
care	1
will	1
be	1
born	1
to	1
replace	1
those	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
cruelly	1
deprived	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
But	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
threat	1
returned	1
nor	1
can	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
omnipotent	1
as	1
the	1
fiend	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
deeds	1
of	1
blood	1
I	1
should	1
almost	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
invincible	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
pronounced	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
I	1
should	1
regard	1
the	1
threatened	1
fate	1
as	1
unavoidable	1
But	1
death	1
was	1
no	1
evil	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
balanced	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
therefore	1
with	1
a	1
contented	1
and	1
even	1
cheerful	1
countenance	1
agreed	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
cousin	1
would	1
consent	1
the	1
ceremony	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
ten	1
days	1
and	1
thus	1
put	1
as	1
I	1
imagined	1
the	1
seal	1
to	1
my	1
fate	1
Great	1
God	1
If	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
I	1
had	1
thought	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
hellish	1
intention	1
of	1
my	1
fiendish	1
adversary	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
banished	1
myself	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
wandered	1
a	1
friendless	1
outcast	1
over	1
the	1
earth	1
than	1
have	1
consented	1
to	1
this	1
miserable	1
marriage	1
But	1
as	1
if	1
possessed	1
of	1
magic	1
powers	1
the	1
monster	1
had	1
blinded	1
me	1
to	1
his	1
real	1
intentions	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
prepared	1
only	1
my	1
own	1
death	1
I	1
hastened	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
far	1
dearer	1
victim	1
As	1
the	1
period	1
fixed	1
for	1
our	1
marriage	1
drew	1
nearer	1
whether	1
from	1
cowardice	1
or	1
a	1
prophetic	1
feeling	1
I	1
felt	1
my	1
heart	1
sink	1
within	1
me	1
But	1
I	1
concealed	1
my	1
feelings	1
by	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
hilarity	1
that	1
brought	1
smiles	1
and	1
joy	1
to	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
but	1
hardly	1
deceived	1
the	1
ever	1
watchful	1
and	1
nicer	1
eye	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
She	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
our	1
union	1
with	1
placid	1
contentment	1
not	1
unmingled	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
fear	1
which	1
past	1
misfortunes	1
had	1
impressed	1
that	1
what	1
now	1
appeared	1
certain	1
and	1
tangible	1
happiness	1
might	1
soon	1
dissipate	1
into	1
an	1
airy	1
dream	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
trace	1
but	1
deep	1
and	1
everlasting	1
regret	1
Preparations	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
event	1
congratulatory	1
visits	1
were	1
received	1
and	1
all	1
wore	1
a	1
smiling	1
appearance	1
I	1
shut	1
up	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
the	1
anxiety	1
that	1
preyed	1
there	1
and	1
entered	1
with	1
seeming	1
earnestness	1
into	1
the	1
plans	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
although	1
they	1
might	1
only	1
serve	1
as	1
the	1
decorations	1
of	1
my	1
tragedy	1
Through	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
exertions	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
restored	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
government	1
A	1
small	1
possession	1
on	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
Como	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
It	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
immediately	1
after	1
our	1
union	1
we	1
should	1
proceed	1
to	1
Villa	1
Lavenza	1
and	1
spend	1
our	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
happiness	1
beside	1
the	1
beautiful	1
lake	1
near	1
which	1
it	1
stood	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
I	1
took	1
every	1
precaution	1
to	1
defend	1
my	1
person	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
fiend	1
should	1
openly	1
attack	1
me	1
I	1
carried	1
pistols	1
and	1
a	1
dagger	1
constantly	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
was	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
to	1
prevent	1
artifice	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
gained	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
Indeed	1
as	1
the	1
period	1
approached	1
the	1
threat	1
appeared	1
more	1
as	1
a	1
delusion	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
worthy	1
to	1
disturb	1
my	1
peace	1
while	1
the	1
happiness	1
I	1
hoped	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
marriage	1
wore	1
a	1
greater	1
appearance	1
of	1
certainty	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
for	1
its	1
solemnisation	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
continually	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
an	1
occurrence	1
which	1
no	1
accident	1
could	1
possibly	1
prevent	1
Elizabeth	1
seemed	1
happy	1
my	1
tranquil	1
demeanour	1
contributed	1
greatly	1
to	1
calm	1
her	1
mind	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
fulfil	1
my	1
wishes	1
and	1
my	1
destiny	1
she	1
was	1
melancholy	1
and	1
a	1
presentiment	1
of	1
evil	1
pervaded	1
her	1
and	1
perhaps	1
also	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
dreadful	1
secret	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
overjoyed	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bustle	1
of	1
preparation	1
only	1
recognised	1
in	1
the	1
melancholy	1
of	1
his	1
niece	1
the	1
diffidence	1
of	1
a	1
bride	1
After	1
the	1
ceremony	1
was	1
performed	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
assembled	1
at	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
commence	1
our	1
journey	1
by	1
water	1
sleeping	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
Evian	1
and	1
continuing	1
our	1
voyage	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
fair	1
the	1
wind	1
favourable	1
all	1
smiled	1
on	1
our	1
nuptial	1
embarkation	1
Those	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
during	1
which	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
happiness	1
We	1
passed	1
rapidly	1
along	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
hot	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
sheltered	1
from	1
its	1
rays	1
by	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
canopy	1
while	1
we	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
sometimes	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
where	1
we	1
saw	1
Mont	1
Sal^eve	1
the	1
pleasant	1
banks	1
of	1
Montal`egre	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
surmounting	1
all	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
and	1
the	1
assemblage	1
of	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
that	1
in	1
vain	1
endeavour	1
to	1
emulate	1
her	1
sometimes	1
coasting	1
the	1
opposite	1
banks	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
mighty	1
Jura	1
opposing	1
its	1
dark	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
ambition	1
that	1
would	1
quit	1
its	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
an	1
almost	1
insurmountable	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
invader	1
who	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
enslave	1
it	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
You	1
are	1
sorrowful	1
my	1
love	1
Ah	1
If	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
may	1
yet	1
endure	1
you	1
would	1
endeavour	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
taste	1
the	1
quiet	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
despair	1
that	1
this	1
one	1
day	1
at	1
least	1
permits	1
me	1
to	1
enjoy	1
Be	1
happy	1
my	1
dear	1
Victor	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
there	1
is	1
I	1
hope	1
nothing	1
to	1
distress	1
you	1
and	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
lively	1
joy	1
is	1
not	1
painted	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
contented	1
Something	1
whispers	1
to	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
depend	1
too	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
that	1
is	1
opened	1
before	1
us	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
sinister	1
voice	1
Observe	1
how	1
fast	1
we	1
move	1
along	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
clouds	1
which	1
sometimes	1
obscure	1
and	1
sometimes	1
rise	1
above	1
the	1
dome	1
of	1
Mont	1
Blanc	1
render	1
this	1
scene	1
of	1
beauty	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
Look	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
innumerable	1
fish	1
that	1
are	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
waters	1
where	1
we	1
can	1
distinguish	1
every	1
pebble	1
that	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
What	1
a	1
divine	1
day	1
How	1
happy	1
and	1
serene	1
all	1
nature	1
appears	1
Thus	1
Elizabeth	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
divert	1
her	1
thoughts	1
and	1
mine	1
from	1
all	1
reflection	1
upon	1
melancholy	1
subjects	1
But	1
her	1
temper	1
was	1
fluctuating	1
joy	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
instants	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
it	1
continually	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
distraction	1
and	1
reverie	1
The	1
sun	1
sank	1
lower	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
we	1
passed	1
the	1
river	1
Drance	1
and	1
observed	1
its	1
path	1
through	1
the	1
chasms	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
and	1
the	1
glens	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
hills	1
The	1
Alps	1
here	1
come	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
lake	1
and	1
we	1
approached	1
the	1
amphitheatre	1
of	1
mountains	1
which	1
forms	1
its	1
eastern	1
boundary	1
The	1
spire	1
of	1
Evian	1
shone	1
under	1
the	1
woods	1
that	1
surrounded	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
mountain	1
above	1
mountain	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
overhung	1
The	1
wind	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
carried	1
us	1
along	1
with	1
amazing	1
rapidity	1
sank	1
at	1
sunset	1
to	1
a	1
light	1
breeze	1
the	1
soft	1
air	1
just	1
ruffled	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
caused	1
a	1
pleasant	1
motion	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
as	1
we	1
approached	1
the	1
shore	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
wafted	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
hay	1
The	1
sun	1
sank	1
beneath	1
the	1
horizon	1
as	1
we	1
landed	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
touched	1
the	1
shore	1
I	1
felt	1
those	1
cares	1
and	1
fears	1
revive	1
which	1
soon	1
were	1
to	1
clasp	1
me	1
and	1
cling	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
ever	1
Chapter	1
23	1
It	1
was	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
we	1
landed	1
we	1
walked	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
enjoying	1
the	1
transitory	1
light	1
and	1
then	1
retired	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
and	1
contemplated	1
the	1
lovely	1
scene	1
of	1
waters	1
woods	1
and	1
mountains	1
obscured	1
in	1
darkness	1
yet	1
still	1
displaying	1
their	1
black	1
outlines	1
The	1
wind	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
now	1
rose	1
with	1
great	1
violence	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
The	1
moon	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
summit	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
descend	1
the	1
clouds	1
swept	1
across	1
it	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
vulture	1
and	1
dimmed	1
her	1
rays	1
while	1
the	1
lake	1
reflected	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
busy	1
heavens	1
rendered	1
still	1
busier	1
by	1
the	1
restless	1
waves	1
that	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
rise	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
heavy	1
storm	1
of	1
rain	1
descended	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
calm	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
but	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
night	1
obscured	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
objects	1
a	1
thousand	1
fears	1
arose	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
I	1
was	1
anxious	1
and	1
watchful	1
while	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
grasped	1
a	1
pistol	1
which	1
was	1
hidden	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
every	1
sound	1
terrified	1
me	1
but	1
I	1
resolved	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
sell	1
my	1
life	1
dearly	1
and	1
not	1
shrink	1
from	1
the	1
conflict	1
until	1
my	1
own	1
life	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
adversary	1
was	1
extinguished	1
Elizabeth	1
observed	1
my	1
agitation	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
timid	1
and	1
fearful	1
silence	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
my	1
glance	1
which	1
communicated	1
terror	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
trembling	1
she	1
asked	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
agitates	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
Victor	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
fear	1
Oh	1
Peace	1
peace	1
my	1
love	1
replied	1
I	1
this	1
night	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
safe	1
but	1
this	1
night	1
is	1
dreadful	1
very	1
dreadful	1
I	1
passed	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
when	1
suddenly	1
I	1
reflected	1
how	1
fearful	1
the	1
combat	1
which	1
I	1
momentarily	1
expected	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
I	1
earnestly	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
retire	1
resolving	1
not	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
obtained	1
some	1
knowledge	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
my	1
enemy	1
She	1
left	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
continued	1
some	1
time	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
passages	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
inspecting	1
every	1
corner	1
that	1
might	1
afford	1
a	1
retreat	1
to	1
my	1
adversary	1
But	1
I	1
discovered	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
conjecture	1
that	1
some	1
fortunate	1
chance	1
had	1
intervened	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
menaces	1
when	1
suddenly	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
shrill	1
and	1
dreadful	1
scream	1
It	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
into	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
retired	1
As	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
rushed	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
my	1
arms	1
dropped	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
every	1
muscle	1
and	1
fibre	1
was	1
suspended	1
I	1
could	1
feel	1
the	1
blood	1
trickling	1
in	1
my	1
veins	1
and	1
tingling	1
in	1
the	1
extremities	1
of	1
my	1
limbs	1
This	1
state	1
lasted	1
but	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
scream	1
was	1
repeated	1
and	1
I	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
Great	1
God	1
Why	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
then	1
expire	1
Why	1
am	1
I	1
here	1
to	1
relate	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
purest	1
creature	1
on	1
earth	1
She	1
was	1
there	1
lifeless	1
and	1
inanimate	1
thrown	1
across	1
the	1
bed	1
her	1
head	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
her	1
pale	1
and	1
distorted	1
features	1
half	1
covered	1
by	1
her	1
hair	1
Everywhere	1
I	1
turn	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
figure	1
her	1
bloodless	1
arms	1
and	1
relaxed	1
form	1
flung	1
by	1
the	1
murderer	1
on	1
its	1
bridal	1
bier	1
Could	1
I	1
behold	1
this	1
and	1
live	1
Alas	1
Life	1
is	1
obstinate	1
and	1
clings	1
closest	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
hated	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
only	1
did	1
I	1
lose	1
recollection	1
I	1
fell	1
senseless	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
When	1
I	1
recovered	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
their	1
countenances	1
expressed	1
a	1
breathless	1
terror	1
but	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
others	1
appeared	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
mockery	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
feelings	1
that	1
oppressed	1
me	1
I	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
lay	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
my	1
love	1
my	1
wife	1
so	1
lately	1
living	1
so	1
dear	1
so	1
worthy	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
posture	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
beheld	1
her	1
and	1
now	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
her	1
head	1
upon	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
thrown	1
across	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
supposed	1
her	1
asleep	1
I	1
rushed	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
with	1
ardour	1
but	1
the	1
deadly	1
languor	1
and	1
coldness	1
of	1
the	1
limbs	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
held	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Elizabeth	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
loved	1
and	1
cherished	1
The	1
murderous	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
s	1
grasp	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
issue	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
While	1
I	1
still	1
hung	1
over	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
despair	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
The	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
darkened	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
panic	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
pale	1
yellow	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
illuminate	1
the	1
chamber	1
The	1
shutters	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
back	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
horror	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
described	1
I	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
a	1
figure	1
the	1
most	1
hideous	1
and	1
abhorred	1
A	1
grin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
jeer	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
fiendish	1
finger	1
he	1
pointed	1
towards	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
I	1
rushed	1
towards	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
pistol	1
from	1
my	1
bosom	1
fired	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
me	1
leaped	1
from	1
his	1
station	1
and	1
running	1
with	1
the	1
swiftness	1
of	1
lightning	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
The	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
pistol	1
brought	1
a	1
crowd	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
I	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
we	1
followed	1
the	1
track	1
with	1
boats	1
nets	1
were	1
cast	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
After	1
passing	1
several	1
hours	1
we	1
returned	1
hopeless	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
companions	1
believing	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
form	1
conjured	1
up	1
by	1
my	1
fancy	1
After	1
having	1
landed	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
country	1
parties	1
going	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
among	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
vines	1
I	1
attempted	1
to	1
accompany	1
them	1
and	1
proceeded	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
my	1
head	1
whirled	1
round	1
my	1
steps	1
were	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
drunken	1
man	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
utter	1
exhaustion	1
a	1
film	1
covered	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
my	1
skin	1
was	1
parched	1
with	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
fever	1
In	1
this	1
state	1
I	1
was	1
carried	1
back	1
and	1
placed	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
hardly	1
conscious	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
my	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
seek	1
something	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
lost	1
After	1
an	1
interval	1
I	1
arose	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
instinct	1
crawled	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
lay	1
There	1
were	1
women	1
weeping	1
around	1
I	1
hung	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
joined	1
my	1
sad	1
tears	1
to	1
theirs	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
no	1
distinct	1
idea	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
but	1
my	1
thoughts	1
rambled	1
to	1
various	1
subjects	1
reflecting	1
confusedly	1
on	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
their	1
cause	1
I	1
was	1
bewildered	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
horror	1
The	1
death	1
of	1
William	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
Justine	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
Clerval	1
and	1
lastly	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
my	1
only	1
remaining	1
friends	1
were	1
safe	1
from	1
the	1
malignity	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
my	1
father	1
even	1
now	1
might	1
be	1
writhing	1
under	1
his	1
grasp	1
and	1
Ernest	1
might	1
be	1
dead	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
This	1
idea	1
made	1
me	1
shudder	1
and	1
recalled	1
me	1
to	1
action	1
I	1
started	1
up	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Geneva	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
speed	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
procured	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
lake	1
but	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
unfavourable	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
fell	1
in	1
torrents	1
However	1
it	1
was	1
hardly	1
morning	1
and	1
I	1
might	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
arrive	1
by	1
night	1
I	1
hired	1
men	1
to	1
row	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
oar	1
myself	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
always	1
experienced	1
relief	1
from	1
mental	1
torment	1
in	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
But	1
the	1
overflowing	1
misery	1
I	1
now	1
felt	1
and	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
agitation	1
that	1
I	1
endured	1
rendered	1
me	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
exertion	1
I	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
oar	1
and	1
leaning	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
my	1
hands	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
every	1
gloomy	1
idea	1
that	1
arose	1
If	1
I	1
looked	1
up	1
I	1
saw	1
scenes	1
which	1
were	1
familiar	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
happier	1
time	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
contemplated	1
but	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
but	1
a	1
shadow	1
and	1
a	1
recollection	1
Tears	1
streamed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
The	1
rain	1
had	1
ceased	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
fish	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
then	1
been	1
observed	1
by	1
Elizabeth	1
Nothing	1
is	1
so	1
painful	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
sudden	1
change	1
The	1
sun	1
might	1
shine	1
or	1
the	1
clouds	1
might	1
lower	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
A	1
fiend	1
had	1
snatched	1
from	1
me	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
no	1
creature	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
so	1
miserable	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
frightful	1
an	1
event	1
is	1
single	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
man	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
incidents	1
that	1
followed	1
this	1
last	1
overwhelming	1
event	1
Mine	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
horrors	1
I	1
have	1
reached	1
their	1
acme	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
now	1
relate	1
can	1
but	1
be	1
tedious	1
to	1
you	1
Know	1
that	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
my	1
friends	1
were	1
snatched	1
away	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
desolate	1
My	1
own	1
strength	1
is	1
exhausted	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
what	1
remains	1
of	1
my	1
hideous	1
narration	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
Geneva	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
Ernest	1
yet	1
lived	1
but	1
the	1
former	1
sunk	1
under	1
the	1
tidings	1
that	1
I	1
bore	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
now	1
excellent	1
and	1
venerable	1
old	1
man	1
His	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
in	1
vacancy	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
charm	1
and	1
their	1
delight	1
his	1
Elizabeth	1
his	1
more	1
than	1
daughter	1
whom	1
he	1
doted	1
on	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
affection	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
life	1
having	1
few	1
affections	1
clings	1
more	1
earnestly	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
remain	1
Cursed	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
fiend	1
that	1
brought	1
misery	1
on	1
his	1
grey	1
hairs	1
and	1
doomed	1
him	1
to	1
waste	1
in	1
wretchedness	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
under	1
the	1
horrors	1
that	1
were	1
accumulated	1
around	1
him	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
existence	1
suddenly	1
gave	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
What	1
then	1
became	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
I	1
lost	1
sensation	1
and	1
chains	1
and	1
darkness	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
that	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
Sometimes	1
indeed	1
I	1
dreamt	1
that	1
I	1
wandered	1
in	1
flowery	1
meadows	1
and	1
pleasant	1
vales	1
with	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
my	1
youth	1
but	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
dungeon	1
Melancholy	1
followed	1
but	1
by	1
degrees	1
I	1
gained	1
a	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
my	1
miseries	1
and	1
situation	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
released	1
from	1
my	1
prison	1
For	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
me	1
mad	1
and	1
during	1
many	1
months	1
as	1
I	1
understood	1
a	1
solitary	1
cell	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
habitation	1
Liberty	1
however	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
useless	1
gift	1
to	1
me	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
awakened	1
to	1
reason	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
awakened	1
to	1
revenge	1
As	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
past	1
misfortunes	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
their	1
cause	1
the	1
monster	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
created	1
the	1
miserable	1
daemon	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
sent	1
abroad	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
my	1
destruction	1
I	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
a	1
maddening	1
rage	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
desired	1
and	1
ardently	1
prayed	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
him	1
within	1
my	1
grasp	1
to	1
wreak	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
signal	1
revenge	1
on	1
his	1
cursed	1
head	1
Nor	1
did	1
my	1
hate	1
long	1
confine	1
itself	1
to	1
useless	1
wishes	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
means	1
of	1
securing	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
about	1
a	1
month	1
after	1
my	1
release	1
I	1
repaired	1
to	1
a	1
criminal	1
judge	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
accusation	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
destroyer	1
of	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
required	1
him	1
to	1
exert	1
his	1
whole	1
authority	1
for	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
murderer	1
The	1
magistrate	1
listened	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
attention	1
and	1
kindness	1
Be	1
assured	1
sir	1
said	1
he	1
no	1
pains	1
or	1
exertions	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
spared	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
villain	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
replied	1
I	1
listen	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
deposition	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
It	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
tale	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
fear	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
credit	1
it	1
were	1
there	1
not	1
something	1
in	1
truth	1
which	1
however	1
wonderful	1
forces	1
conviction	1
The	1
story	1
is	1
too	1
connected	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
motive	1
for	1
falsehood	1
My	1
manner	1
as	1
I	1
thus	1
addressed	1
him	1
was	1
impressive	1
but	1
calm	1
I	1
had	1
formed	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
a	1
resolution	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
destroyer	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
this	1
purpose	1
quieted	1
my	1
agony	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
interval	1
reconciled	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
I	1
now	1
related	1
my	1
history	1
briefly	1
but	1
with	1
firmness	1
and	1
precision	1
marking	1
the	1
dates	1
with	1
accuracy	1
and	1
never	1
deviating	1
into	1
invective	1
or	1
exclamation	1
The	1
magistrate	1
appeared	1
at	1
first	1
perfectly	1
incredulous	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
continued	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
attentive	1
and	1
interested	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
sometimes	1
shudder	1
with	1
horror	1
at	1
others	1
a	1
lively	1
surprise	1
unmingled	1
with	1
disbelief	1
was	1
painted	1
on	1
his	1
countenance	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
concluded	1
my	1
narration	1
I	1
said	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
being	1
whom	1
I	1
accuse	1
and	1
for	1
whose	1
seizure	1
and	1
punishment	1
I	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
to	1
exert	1
your	1
whole	1
power	1
It	1
is	1
your	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
your	1
feelings	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
not	1
revolt	1
from	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
those	1
functions	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
This	1
address	1
caused	1
a	1
considerable	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
physiognomy	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
auditor	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
my	1
story	1
with	1
that	1
half	1
kind	1
of	1
belief	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
supernatural	1
events	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
act	1
officially	1
in	1
consequence	1
the	1
whole	1
tide	1
of	1
his	1
incredulity	1
returned	1
He	1
however	1
answered	1
mildly	1
I	1
would	1
willingly	1
afford	1
you	1
every	1
aid	1
in	1
your	1
pursuit	1
but	1
the	1
creature	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
speak	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
powers	1
which	1
would	1
put	1
all	1
my	1
exertions	1
to	1
defiance	1
Who	1
can	1
follow	1
an	1
animal	1
which	1
can	1
traverse	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
and	1
inhabit	1
caves	1
and	1
dens	1
where	1
no	1
man	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
intrude	1
Besides	1
some	1
months	1
have	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
his	1
crimes	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
conjecture	1
to	1
what	1
place	1
he	1
has	1
wandered	1
or	1
what	1
region	1
he	1
may	1
now	1
inhabit	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
hovers	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
which	1
I	1
inhabit	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
indeed	1
taken	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
Alps	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
hunted	1
like	1
the	1
chamois	1
and	1
destroyed	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
of	1
prey	1
But	1
I	1
perceive	1
your	1
thoughts	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
credit	1
my	1
narrative	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
enemy	1
with	1
the	1
punishment	1
which	1
is	1
his	1
desert	1
As	1
I	1
spoke	1
rage	1
sparkled	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
the	1
magistrate	1
was	1
intimidated	1
You	1
are	1
mistaken	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
will	1
exert	1
myself	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
monster	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
punishment	1
proportionate	1
to	1
his	1
crimes	1
But	1
I	1
fear	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
yourself	1
described	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
properties	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
impracticable	1
and	1
thus	1
while	1
every	1
proper	1
measure	1
is	1
pursued	1
you	1
should	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
disappointment	1
That	1
cannot	1
be	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
avail	1
My	1
revenge	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
moment	1
to	1
you	1
yet	1
while	1
I	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
vice	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
devouring	1
and	1
only	1
passion	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
My	1
rage	1
is	1
unspeakable	1
when	1
I	1
reflect	1
that	1
the	1
murderer	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
turned	1
loose	1
upon	1
society	1
still	1
exists	1
You	1
refuse	1
my	1
just	1
demand	1
I	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
resource	1
and	1
I	1
devote	1
myself	1
either	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
to	1
his	1
destruction	1
I	1
trembled	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
agitation	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
frenzy	1
in	1
my	1
manner	1
and	1
something	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
of	1
that	1
haughty	1
fierceness	1
which	1
the	1
martyrs	1
of	1
old	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
possessed	1
But	1
to	1
a	1
Genevan	1
magistrate	1
whose	1
mind	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
far	1
other	1
ideas	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
devotion	1
and	1
heroism	1
this	1
elevation	1
of	1
mind	1
had	1
much	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
madness	1
He	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
soothe	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
nurse	1
does	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
reverted	1
to	1
my	1
tale	1
as	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
delirium	1
Man	1
I	1
cried	1
how	1
ignorant	1
art	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
pride	1
of	1
wisdom	1
Cease	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
say	1
I	1
broke	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
angry	1
and	1
disturbed	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
meditate	1
on	1
some	1
other	1
mode	1
of	1
action	1
Chapter	1
24	1
My	1
present	1
situation	1
was	1
one	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
voluntary	1
thought	1
was	1
swallowed	1
up	1
and	1
lost	1
I	1
was	1
hurried	1
away	1
by	1
fury	1
revenge	1
alone	1
endowed	1
me	1
with	1
strength	1
and	1
composure	1
it	1
moulded	1
my	1
feelings	1
and	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
calculating	1
and	1
calm	1
at	1
periods	1
when	1
otherwise	1
delirium	1
or	1
death	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
portion	1
My	1
first	1
resolution	1
was	1
to	1
quit	1
Geneva	1
for	1
ever	1
my	1
country	1
which	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
happy	1
and	1
beloved	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
in	1
my	1
adversity	1
became	1
hateful	1
I	1
provided	1
myself	1
with	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
jewels	1
which	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
departed	1
And	1
now	1
my	1
wanderings	1
began	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
cease	1
but	1
with	1
life	1
I	1
have	1
traversed	1
a	1
vast	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
have	1
endured	1
all	1
the	1
hardships	1
which	1
travellers	1
in	1
deserts	1
and	1
barbarous	1
countries	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
meet	1
How	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
many	1
times	1
have	1
I	1
stretched	1
my	1
failing	1
limbs	1
upon	1
the	1
sandy	1
plain	1
and	1
prayed	1
for	1
death	1
But	1
revenge	1
kept	1
me	1
alive	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
die	1
and	1
leave	1
my	1
adversary	1
in	1
being	1
When	1
I	1
quitted	1
Geneva	1
my	1
first	1
labour	1
was	1
to	1
gain	1
some	1
clue	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
might	1
trace	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
my	1
fiendish	1
enemy	1
But	1
my	1
plan	1
was	1
unsettled	1
and	1
I	1
wandered	1
many	1
hours	1
round	1
the	1
confines	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
uncertain	1
what	1
path	1
I	1
should	1
pursue	1
As	1
night	1
approached	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
cemetery	1
where	1
William	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
reposed	1
I	1
entered	1
it	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
tomb	1
which	1
marked	1
their	1
graves	1
Everything	1
was	1
silent	1
except	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
which	1
were	1
gently	1
agitated	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
nearly	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
scene	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
solemn	1
and	1
affecting	1
even	1
to	1
an	1
uninterested	1
observer	1
The	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
departed	1
seemed	1
to	1
flit	1
around	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
shadow	1
which	1
was	1
felt	1
but	1
not	1
seen	1
around	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
mourner	1
The	1
deep	1
grief	1
which	1
this	1
scene	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
excited	1
quickly	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
rage	1
and	1
despair	1
They	1
were	1
dead	1
and	1
I	1
lived	1
their	1
murderer	1
also	1
lived	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
I	1
must	1
drag	1
out	1
my	1
weary	1
existence	1
I	1
knelt	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips	1
exclaimed	1
By	1
the	1
sacred	1
earth	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
kneel	1
by	1
the	1
shades	1
that	1
wander	1
near	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
eternal	1
grief	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
swear	1
and	1
by	1
thee	1
O	1
Night	1
and	1
the	1
spirits	1
that	1
preside	1
over	1
thee	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
daemon	1
who	1
caused	1
this	1
misery	1
until	1
he	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
perish	1
in	1
mortal	1
conflict	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
I	1
will	1
preserve	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
execute	1
this	1
dear	1
revenge	1
will	1
I	1
again	1
behold	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
tread	1
the	1
green	1
herbage	1
of	1
earth	1
which	1
otherwise	1
should	1
vanish	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
ever	1
And	1
I	1
call	1
on	1
you	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
on	1
you	1
wandering	1
ministers	1
of	1
vengeance	1
to	1
aid	1
and	1
conduct	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
work	1
Let	1
the	1
cursed	1
and	1
hellish	1
monster	1
drink	1
deep	1
of	1
agony	1
let	1
him	1
feel	1
the	1
despair	1
that	1
now	1
torments	1
me	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
my	1
adjuration	1
with	1
solemnity	1
and	1
an	1
awe	1
which	1
almost	1
assured	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
my	1
murdered	1
friends	1
heard	1
and	1
approved	1
my	1
devotion	1
but	1
the	1
furies	1
possessed	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
concluded	1
and	1
rage	1
choked	1
my	1
utterance	1
I	1
was	1
answered	1
through	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
fiendish	1
laugh	1
It	1
rang	1
on	1
my	1
ears	1
long	1
and	1
heavily	1
the	1
mountains	1
re	1
echoed	1
it	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
hell	1
surrounded	1
me	1
with	1
mockery	1
and	1
laughter	1
Surely	1
in	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
possessed	1
by	1
frenzy	1
and	1
have	1
destroyed	1
my	1
miserable	1
existence	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
vow	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
reserved	1
for	1
vengeance	1
The	1
laughter	1
died	1
away	1
when	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
and	1
abhorred	1
voice	1
apparently	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
an	1
audible	1
whisper	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
miserable	1
wretch	1
You	1
have	1
determined	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
I	1
darted	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sound	1
proceeded	1
but	1
the	1
devil	1
eluded	1
my	1
grasp	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
broad	1
disk	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
arose	1
and	1
shone	1
full	1
upon	1
his	1
ghastly	1
and	1
distorted	1
shape	1
as	1
he	1
fled	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
mortal	1
speed	1
I	1
pursued	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
task	1
Guided	1
by	1
a	1
slight	1
clue	1
I	1
followed	1
the	1
windings	1
of	1
the	1
Rhone	1
but	1
vainly	1
The	1
blue	1
Mediterranean	1
appeared	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
chance	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
fiend	1
enter	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
vessel	1
bound	1
for	1
the	1
Black	1
Sea	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
passage	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
ship	1
but	1
he	1
escaped	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
Amidst	1
the	1
wilds	1
of	1
Tartary	1
and	1
Russia	1
although	1
he	1
still	1
evaded	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
followed	1
in	1
his	1
track	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
peasants	1
scared	1
by	1
this	1
horrid	1
apparition	1
informed	1
me	1
of	1
his	1
path	1
sometimes	1
he	1
himself	1
who	1
feared	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
lost	1
all	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
should	1
despair	1
and	1
die	1
left	1
some	1
mark	1
to	1
guide	1
me	1
The	1
snows	1
descended	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
his	1
huge	1
step	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
plain	1
To	1
you	1
first	1
entering	1
on	1
life	1
to	1
whom	1
care	1
is	1
new	1
and	1
agony	1
unknown	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
and	1
still	1
feel	1
Cold	1
want	1
and	1
fatigue	1
were	1
the	1
least	1
pains	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
endure	1
I	1
was	1
cursed	1
by	1
some	1
devil	1
and	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
me	1
my	1
eternal	1
hell	1
yet	1
still	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
good	1
followed	1
and	1
directed	1
my	1
steps	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
most	1
murmured	1
would	1
suddenly	1
extricate	1
me	1
from	1
seemingly	1
insurmountable	1
difficulties	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
nature	1
overcome	1
by	1
hunger	1
sank	1
under	1
the	1
exhaustion	1
a	1
repast	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
that	1
restored	1
and	1
inspirited	1
me	1
The	1
fare	1
was	1
indeed	1
coarse	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
ate	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
spirits	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
invoked	1
to	1
aid	1
me	1
Often	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
dry	1
the	1
heavens	1
cloudless	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
parched	1
by	1
thirst	1
a	1
slight	1
cloud	1
would	1
bedim	1
the	1
sky	1
shed	1
the	1
few	1
drops	1
that	1
revived	1
me	1
and	1
vanish	1
I	1
followed	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
the	1
courses	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
but	1
the	1
daemon	1
generally	1
avoided	1
these	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
chiefly	1
collected	1
In	1
other	1
places	1
human	1
beings	1
were	1
seldom	1
seen	1
and	1
I	1
generally	1
subsisted	1
on	1
the	1
wild	1
animals	1
that	1
crossed	1
my	1
path	1
I	1
had	1
money	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
gained	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
villagers	1
by	1
distributing	1
it	1
or	1
I	1
brought	1
with	1
me	1
some	1
food	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
killed	1
which	1
after	1
taking	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
I	1
always	1
presented	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
provided	1
me	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
utensils	1
for	1
cooking	1
My	1
life	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
thus	1
was	1
indeed	1
hateful	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
during	1
sleep	1
alone	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
taste	1
joy	1
O	1
blessed	1
sleep	1
Often	1
when	1
most	1
miserable	1
I	1
sank	1
to	1
repose	1
and	1
my	1
dreams	1
lulled	1
me	1
even	1
to	1
rapture	1
The	1
spirits	1
that	1
guarded	1
me	1
had	1
provided	1
these	1
moments	1
or	1
rather	1
hours	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
retain	1
strength	1
to	1
fulfil	1
my	1
pilgrimage	1
Deprived	1
of	1
this	1
respite	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sunk	1
under	1
my	1
hardships	1
During	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
sustained	1
and	1
inspirited	1
by	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
night	1
for	1
in	1
sleep	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
friends	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
my	1
beloved	1
country	1
again	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
heard	1
the	1
silver	1
tones	1
of	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
beheld	1
Clerval	1
enjoying	1
health	1
and	1
youth	1
Often	1
when	1
wearied	1
by	1
a	1
toilsome	1
march	1
I	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
dreaming	1
until	1
night	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
then	1
enjoy	1
reality	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
my	1
dearest	1
friends	1
What	1
agonising	1
fondness	1
did	1
I	1
feel	1
for	1
them	1
How	1
did	1
I	1
cling	1
to	1
their	1
dear	1
forms	1
as	1
sometimes	1
they	1
haunted	1
even	1
my	1
waking	1
hours	1
and	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
they	1
still	1
lived	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
vengeance	1
that	1
burned	1
within	1
me	1
died	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
I	1
pursued	1
my	1
path	1
towards	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
more	1
as	1
a	1
task	1
enjoined	1
by	1
heaven	1
as	1
the	1
mechanical	1
impulse	1
of	1
some	1
power	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
unconscious	1
than	1
as	1
the	1
ardent	1
desire	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
What	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
whom	1
I	1
pursued	1
I	1
cannot	1
know	1
Sometimes	1
indeed	1
he	1
left	1
marks	1
in	1
writing	1
on	1
the	1
barks	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
or	1
cut	1
in	1
stone	1
that	1
guided	1
me	1
and	1
instigated	1
my	1
fury	1
My	1
reign	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
over	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
legible	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
inscriptions	1
you	1
live	1
and	1
my	1
power	1
is	1
complete	1
Follow	1
me	1
I	1
seek	1
the	1
everlasting	1
ices	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
frost	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
impassive	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
near	1
this	1
place	1
if	1
you	1
follow	1
not	1
too	1
tardily	1
a	1
dead	1
hare	1
eat	1
and	1
be	1
refreshed	1
Come	1
on	1
my	1
enemy	1
we	1
have	1
yet	1
to	1
wrestle	1
for	1
our	1
lives	1
but	1
many	1
hard	1
and	1
miserable	1
hours	1
must	1
you	1
endure	1
until	1
that	1
period	1
shall	1
arrive	1
Scoffing	1
devil	1
Again	1
do	1
I	1
vow	1
vengeance	1
again	1
do	1
I	1
devote	1
thee	1
miserable	1
fiend	1
to	1
torture	1
and	1
death	1
Never	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
my	1
search	1
until	1
he	1
or	1
I	1
perish	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
what	1
ecstasy	1
shall	1
I	1
join	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
my	1
departed	1
friends	1
who	1
even	1
now	1
prepare	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
my	1
tedious	1
toil	1
and	1
horrible	1
pilgrimage	1
As	1
I	1
still	1
pursued	1
my	1
journey	1
to	1
the	1
northward	1
the	1
snows	1
thickened	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
increased	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
almost	1
too	1
severe	1
to	1
support	1
The	1
peasants	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hovels	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
hardy	1
ventured	1
forth	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
animals	1
whom	1
starvation	1
had	1
forced	1
from	1
their	1
hiding	1
places	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
prey	1
The	1
rivers	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
ice	1
and	1
no	1
fish	1
could	1
be	1
procured	1
and	1
thus	1
I	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
my	1
chief	1
article	1
of	1
maintenance	1
The	1
triumph	1
of	1
my	1
enemy	1
increased	1
with	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
my	1
labours	1
One	1
inscription	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
Prepare	1
Your	1
toils	1
only	1
begin	1
wrap	1
yourself	1
in	1
furs	1
and	1
provide	1
food	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
enter	1
upon	1
a	1
journey	1
where	1
your	1
sufferings	1
will	1
satisfy	1
my	1
everlasting	1
hatred	1
My	1
courage	1
and	1
perseverance	1
were	1
invigorated	1
by	1
these	1
scoffing	1
words	1
I	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
fail	1
in	1
my	1
purpose	1
and	1
calling	1
on	1
Heaven	1
to	1
support	1
me	1
I	1
continued	1
with	1
unabated	1
fervour	1
to	1
traverse	1
immense	1
deserts	1
until	1
the	1
ocean	1
appeared	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
formed	1
the	1
utmost	1
boundary	1
of	1
the	1
horizon	1
Oh	1
How	1
unlike	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
blue	1
seasons	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
Covered	1
with	1
ice	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
from	1
land	1
by	1
its	1
superior	1
wildness	1
and	1
ruggedness	1
The	1
Greeks	1
wept	1
for	1
joy	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
from	1
the	1
hills	1
of	1
Asia	1
and	1
hailed	1
with	1
rapture	1
the	1
boundary	1
of	1
their	1
toils	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
weep	1
but	1
I	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
heart	1
thanked	1
my	1
guiding	1
spirit	1
for	1
conducting	1
me	1
in	1
safety	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
hoped	1
notwithstanding	1
my	1
adversary	1
s	1
gibe	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
grapple	1
with	1
him	1
Some	1
weeks	1
before	1
this	1
period	1
I	1
had	1
procured	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
dogs	1
and	1
thus	1
traversed	1
the	1
snows	1
with	1
inconceivable	1
speed	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
the	1
fiend	1
possessed	1
the	1
same	1
advantages	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
as	1
before	1
I	1
had	1
daily	1
lost	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
I	1
now	1
gained	1
on	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
the	1
ocean	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
day	1
s	1
journey	1
in	1
advance	1
and	1
I	1
hoped	1
to	1
intercept	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
should	1
reach	1
the	1
beach	1
With	1
new	1
courage	1
therefore	1
I	1
pressed	1
on	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
days	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
wretched	1
hamlet	1
on	1
the	1
seashore	1
I	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
concerning	1
the	1
fiend	1
and	1
gained	1
accurate	1
information	1
A	1
gigantic	1
monster	1
they	1
said	1
had	1
arrived	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
gun	1
and	1
many	1
pistols	1
putting	1
to	1
flight	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
a	1
solitary	1
cottage	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
his	1
terrific	1
appearance	1
He	1
had	1
carried	1
off	1
their	1
store	1
of	1
winter	1
food	1
and	1
placing	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
sledge	1
to	1
draw	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seized	1
on	1
a	1
numerous	1
drove	1
of	1
trained	1
dogs	1
he	1
had	1
harnessed	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
to	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
horror	1
struck	1
villagers	1
had	1
pursued	1
his	1
journey	1
across	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
direction	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
no	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
conjectured	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
speedily	1
be	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
or	1
frozen	1
by	1
the	1
eternal	1
frosts	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
information	1
I	1
suffered	1
a	1
temporary	1
access	1
of	1
despair	1
He	1
had	1
escaped	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
commence	1
a	1
destructive	1
and	1
almost	1
endless	1
journey	1
across	1
the	1
mountainous	1
ices	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
amidst	1
cold	1
that	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
could	1
long	1
endure	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
the	1
native	1
of	1
a	1
genial	1
and	1
sunny	1
climate	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
survive	1
Yet	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
fiend	1
should	1
live	1
and	1
be	1
triumphant	1
my	1
rage	1
and	1
vengeance	1
returned	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
tide	1
overwhelmed	1
every	1
other	1
feeling	1
After	1
a	1
slight	1
repose	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
hovered	1
round	1
and	1
instigated	1
me	1
to	1
toil	1
and	1
revenge	1
I	1
prepared	1
for	1
my	1
journey	1
I	1
exchanged	1
my	1
land	1
sledge	1
for	1
one	1
fashioned	1
for	1
the	1
inequalities	1
of	1
the	1
Frozen	1
Ocean	1
and	1
purchasing	1
a	1
plentiful	1
stock	1
of	1
provisions	1
I	1
departed	1
from	1
land	1
I	1
cannot	1
guess	1
how	1
many	1
days	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
then	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
endured	1
misery	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
eternal	1
sentiment	1
of	1
a	1
just	1
retribution	1
burning	1
within	1
my	1
heart	1
could	1
have	1
enabled	1
me	1
to	1
support	1
Immense	1
and	1
rugged	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
often	1
barred	1
up	1
my	1
passage	1
and	1
I	1
often	1
heard	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
sea	1
which	1
threatened	1
my	1
destruction	1
But	1
again	1
the	1
frost	1
came	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
secure	1
By	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
provision	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
consumed	1
I	1
should	1
guess	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
passed	1
three	1
weeks	1
in	1
this	1
journey	1
and	1
the	1
continual	1
protraction	1
of	1
hope	1
returning	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
heart	1
often	1
wrung	1
bitter	1
drops	1
of	1
despondency	1
and	1
grief	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
Despair	1
had	1
indeed	1
almost	1
secured	1
her	1
prey	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
sunk	1
beneath	1
this	1
misery	1
Once	1
after	1
the	1
poor	1
animals	1
that	1
conveyed	1
me	1
had	1
with	1
incredible	1
toil	1
gained	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
a	1
sloping	1
ice	1
mountain	1
and	1
one	1
sinking	1
under	1
his	1
fatigue	1
died	1
I	1
viewed	1
the	1
expanse	1
before	1
me	1
with	1
anguish	1
when	1
suddenly	1
my	1
eye	1
caught	1
a	1
dark	1
speck	1
upon	1
the	1
dusky	1
plain	1
I	1
strained	1
my	1
sight	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
wild	1
cry	1
of	1
ecstasy	1
when	1
I	1
distinguished	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
the	1
distorted	1
proportions	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
form	1
within	1
Oh	1
With	1
what	1
a	1
burning	1
gush	1
did	1
hope	1
revisit	1
my	1
heart	1
Warm	1
tears	1
filled	1
my	1
eyes	1
which	1
I	1
hastily	1
wiped	1
away	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
intercept	1
the	1
view	1
I	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
but	1
still	1
my	1
sight	1
was	1
dimmed	1
by	1
the	1
burning	1
drops	1
until	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
emotions	1
that	1
oppressed	1
me	1
I	1
wept	1
aloud	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
delay	1
I	1
disencumbered	1
the	1
dogs	1
of	1
their	1
dead	1
companion	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
plentiful	1
portion	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
hour	1
s	1
rest	1
which	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
and	1
yet	1
which	1
was	1
bitterly	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
continued	1
my	1
route	1
The	1
sledge	1
was	1
still	1
visible	1
nor	1
did	1
I	1
again	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
except	1
at	1
the	1
moments	1
when	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
some	1
ice	1
rock	1
concealed	1
it	1
with	1
its	1
intervening	1
crags	1
I	1
indeed	1
perceptibly	1
gained	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
after	1
nearly	1
two	1
days	1
journey	1
I	1
beheld	1
my	1
enemy	1
at	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
distant	1
my	1
heart	1
bounded	1
within	1
me	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
appeared	1
almost	1
within	1
grasp	1
of	1
my	1
foe	1
my	1
hopes	1
were	1
suddenly	1
extinguished	1
and	1
I	1
lost	1
all	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
more	1
utterly	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
before	1
A	1
ground	1
sea	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
its	1
progress	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
rolled	1
and	1
swelled	1
beneath	1
me	1
became	1
every	1
moment	1
more	1
ominous	1
and	1
terrific	1
I	1
pressed	1
on	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
The	1
wind	1
arose	1
the	1
sea	1
roared	1
and	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
mighty	1
shock	1
of	1
an	1
earthquake	1
it	1
split	1
and	1
cracked	1
with	1
a	1
tremendous	1
and	1
overwhelming	1
sound	1
The	1
work	1
was	1
soon	1
finished	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
a	1
tumultuous	1
sea	1
rolled	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
enemy	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
drifting	1
on	1
a	1
scattered	1
piece	1
of	1
ice	1
that	1
was	1
continually	1
lessening	1
and	1
thus	1
preparing	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
hideous	1
death	1
In	1
this	1
manner	1
many	1
appalling	1
hours	1
passed	1
several	1
of	1
my	1
dogs	1
died	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sink	1
under	1
the	1
accumulation	1
of	1
distress	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
your	1
vessel	1
riding	1
at	1
anchor	1
and	1
holding	1
forth	1
to	1
me	1
hopes	1
of	1
succour	1
and	1
life	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
that	1
vessels	1
ever	1
came	1
so	1
far	1
north	1
and	1
was	1
astounded	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
I	1
quickly	1
destroyed	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
sledge	1
to	1
construct	1
oars	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
was	1
enabled	1
with	1
infinite	1
fatigue	1
to	1
move	1
my	1
ice	1
raft	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
your	1
ship	1
I	1
had	1
determined	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
southwards	1
still	1
to	1
trust	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
rather	1
than	1
abandon	1
my	1
purpose	1
I	1
hoped	1
to	1
induce	1
you	1
to	1
grant	1
me	1
a	1
boat	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
pursue	1
my	1
enemy	1
But	1
your	1
direction	1
was	1
northwards	1
You	1
took	1
me	1
on	1
board	1
when	1
my	1
vigour	1
was	1
exhausted	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
sunk	1
under	1
my	1
multiplied	1
hardships	1
into	1
a	1
death	1
which	1
I	1
still	1
dread	1
for	1
my	1
task	1
is	1
unfulfilled	1
Oh	1
When	1
will	1
my	1
guiding	1
spirit	1
in	1
conducting	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
daemon	1
allow	1
me	1
the	1
rest	1
I	1
so	1
much	1
desire	1
or	1
must	1
I	1
die	1
and	1
he	1
yet	1
live	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
swear	1
to	1
me	1
Walton	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
escape	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
seek	1
him	1
and	1
satisfy	1
my	1
vengeance	1
in	1
his	1
death	1
And	1
do	1
I	1
dare	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
undertake	1
my	1
pilgrimage	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
hardships	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
undergone	1
No	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
selfish	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
dead	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
appear	1
if	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
vengeance	1
should	1
conduct	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
swear	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
swear	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
triumph	1
over	1
my	1
accumulated	1
woes	1
and	1
survive	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
his	1
dark	1
crimes	1
He	1
is	1
eloquent	1
and	1
persuasive	1
and	1
once	1
his	1
words	1
had	1
even	1
power	1
over	1
my	1
heart	1
but	1
trust	1
him	1
not	1
His	1
soul	1
is	1
as	1
hellish	1
as	1
his	1
form	1
full	1
of	1
treachery	1
and	1
fiend	1
like	1
malice	1
Hear	1
him	1
not	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
William	1
Justine	1
Clerval	1
Elizabeth	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wretched	1
Victor	1
and	1
thrust	1
your	1
sword	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
I	1
will	1
hover	1
near	1
and	1
direct	1
the	1

You	1
have	1
read	1
this	1
strange	1
and	1
terrific	1
story	1
Margaret	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
feel	1
your	1
blood	1
congeal	1
with	1
horror	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
even	1
now	1
curdles	1
mine	1
Sometimes	1
seized	1
with	1
sudden	1
agony	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
continue	1
his	1
tale	1
at	1
others	1
his	1
voice	1
broken	1
yet	1
piercing	1
uttered	1
with	1
difficulty	1
the	1
words	1
so	1
replete	1
with	1
anguish	1
His	1
fine	1
and	1
lovely	1
eyes	1
were	1
now	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
indignation	1
now	1
subdued	1
to	1
downcast	1
sorrow	1
and	1
quenched	1
in	1
infinite	1
wretchedness	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
commanded	1
his	1
countenance	1
and	1
tones	1
and	1
related	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
incidents	1
with	1
a	1
tranquil	1
voice	1
suppressing	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
agitation	1
then	1
like	1
a	1
volcano	1
bursting	1
forth	1
his	1
face	1
would	1
suddenly	1
change	1
to	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
wildest	1
rage	1
as	1
he	1
shrieked	1
out	1
imprecations	1
on	1
his	1
persecutor	1
His	1
tale	1
is	1
connected	1
and	1
told	1
with	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
simplest	1
truth	1
yet	1
I	1
own	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
Felix	1
and	1
Safie	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
seen	1
from	1
our	1
ship	1
brought	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
greater	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
narrative	1
than	1
his	1
asseverations	1
however	1
earnest	1
and	1
connected	1
Such	1
a	1
monster	1
has	1
then	1
really	1
existence	1
I	1
cannot	1
doubt	1
it	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
lost	1
in	1
surprise	1
and	1
admiration	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
gain	1
from	1
Frankenstein	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
his	1
creature	1
s	1
formation	1
but	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
he	1
was	1
impenetrable	1
Are	1
you	1
mad	1
my	1
friend	1
said	1
he	1
Or	1
whither	1
does	1
your	1
senseless	1
curiosity	1
lead	1
you	1
Would	1
you	1
also	1
create	1
for	1
yourself	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
demoniacal	1
enemy	1
Peace	1
peace	1
Learn	1
my	1
miseries	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
increase	1
your	1
own	1
Frankenstein	1
discovered	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
notes	1
concerning	1
his	1
history	1
he	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
corrected	1
and	1
augmented	1
them	1
in	1
many	1
places	1
but	1
principally	1
in	1
giving	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
spirit	1
to	1
the	1
conversations	1
he	1
held	1
with	1
his	1
enemy	1
Since	1
you	1
have	1
preserved	1
my	1
narration	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
mutilated	1
one	1
should	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
posterity	1
Thus	1
has	1
a	1
week	1
passed	1
away	1
while	1
I	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
strangest	1
tale	1
that	1
ever	1
imagination	1
formed	1
My	1
thoughts	1
and	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
have	1
been	1
drunk	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
interest	1
for	1
my	1
guest	1
which	1
this	1
tale	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
elevated	1
and	1
gentle	1
manners	1
have	1
created	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
soothe	1
him	1
yet	1
can	1
I	1
counsel	1
one	1
so	1
infinitely	1
miserable	1
so	1
destitute	1
of	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
consolation	1
to	1
live	1
Oh	1
no	1
The	1
only	1
joy	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
now	1
know	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
composes	1
his	1
shattered	1
spirit	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
death	1
Yet	1
he	1
enjoys	1
one	1
comfort	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
solitude	1
and	1
delirium	1
he	1
believes	1
that	1
when	1
in	1
dreams	1
he	1
holds	1
converse	1
with	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
derives	1
from	1
that	1
communion	1
consolation	1
for	1
his	1
miseries	1
or	1
excitements	1
to	1
his	1
vengeance	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
creations	1
of	1
his	1
fancy	1
but	1
the	1
beings	1
themselves	1
who	1
visit	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
a	1
remote	1
world	1
This	1
faith	1
gives	1
a	1
solemnity	1
to	1
his	1
reveries	1
that	1
render	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
almost	1
as	1
imposing	1
and	1
interesting	1
as	1
truth	1
Our	1
conversations	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
confined	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
history	1
and	1
misfortunes	1
On	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
general	1
literature	1
he	1
displays	1
unbounded	1
knowledge	1
and	1
a	1
quick	1
and	1
piercing	1
apprehension	1
His	1
eloquence	1
is	1
forcible	1
and	1
touching	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
hear	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
relates	1
a	1
pathetic	1
incident	1
or	1
endeavours	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
pity	1
or	1
love	1
without	1
tears	1
What	1
a	1
glorious	1
creature	1
must	1
he	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
prosperity	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
thus	1
noble	1
and	1
godlike	1
in	1
ruin	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
feel	1
his	1
own	1
worth	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
fall	1
When	1
younger	1
said	1
he	1
I	1
believed	1
myself	1
destined	1
for	1
some	1
great	1
enterprise	1
My	1
feelings	1
are	1
profound	1
but	1
I	1
possessed	1
a	1
coolness	1
of	1
judgment	1
that	1
fitted	1
me	1
for	1
illustrious	1
achievements	1
This	1
sentiment	1
of	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
supported	1
me	1
when	1
others	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
oppressed	1
for	1
I	1
deemed	1
it	1
criminal	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
in	1
useless	1
grief	1
those	1
talents	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
When	1
I	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
I	1
had	1
completed	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
one	1
than	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
sensitive	1
and	1
rational	1
animal	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
rank	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
common	1
projectors	1
But	1
this	1
thought	1
which	1
supported	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
my	1
career	1
now	1
serves	1
only	1
to	1
plunge	1
me	1
lower	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
All	1
my	1
speculations	1
and	1
hopes	1
are	1
as	1
nothing	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
archangel	1
who	1
aspired	1
to	1
omnipotence	1
I	1
am	1
chained	1
in	1
an	1
eternal	1
hell	1
My	1
imagination	1
was	1
vivid	1
yet	1
my	1
powers	1
of	1
analysis	1
and	1
application	1
were	1
intense	1
by	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
these	1
qualities	1
I	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
executed	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
Even	1
now	1
I	1
cannot	1
recollect	1
without	1
passion	1
my	1
reveries	1
while	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
incomplete	1
I	1
trod	1
heaven	1
in	1
my	1
thoughts	1
now	1
exulting	1
in	1
my	1
powers	1
now	1
burning	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
effects	1
From	1
my	1
infancy	1
I	1
was	1
imbued	1
with	1
high	1
hopes	1
and	1
a	1
lofty	1
ambition	1
but	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
sunk	1
Oh	1
My	1
friend	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
known	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
once	1
was	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
recognise	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
degradation	1
Despondency	1
rarely	1
visited	1
my	1
heart	1
a	1
high	1
destiny	1
seemed	1
to	1
bear	1
me	1
on	1
until	1
I	1
fell	1
never	1
never	1
again	1
to	1
rise	1
Must	1
I	1
then	1
lose	1
this	1
admirable	1
being	1
I	1
have	1
longed	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
sympathise	1
with	1
and	1
love	1
me	1
Behold	1
on	1
these	1
desert	1
seas	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
but	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
him	1
only	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
value	1
and	1
lose	1
him	1
I	1
would	1
reconcile	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
but	1
he	1
repulses	1
the	1
idea	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
Walton	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
your	1
kind	1
intentions	1
towards	1
so	1
miserable	1
a	1
wretch	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
new	1
ties	1
and	1
fresh	1
affections	1
think	1
you	1
that	1
any	1
can	1
replace	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
gone	1
Can	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
Clerval	1
was	1
or	1
any	1
woman	1
another	1
Elizabeth	1
Even	1
where	1
the	1
affections	1
are	1
not	1
strongly	1
moved	1
by	1
any	1
superior	1
excellence	1
the	1
companions	1
of	1
our	1
childhood	1
always	1
possess	1
a	1
certain	1
power	1
over	1
our	1
minds	1
which	1
hardly	1
any	1
later	1
friend	1
can	1
obtain	1
They	1
know	1
our	1
infantine	1
dispositions	1
which	1
however	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
afterwards	1
modified	1
are	1
never	1
eradicated	1
and	1
they	1
can	1
judge	1
of	1
our	1
actions	1
with	1
more	1
certain	1
conclusions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
our	1
motives	1
A	1
sister	1
or	1
a	1
brother	1
can	1
never	1
unless	1
indeed	1
such	1
symptoms	1
have	1
been	1
shown	1
early	1
suspect	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
fraud	1
or	1
false	1
dealing	1
when	1
another	1
friend	1
however	1
strongly	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
attached	1
may	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
be	1
contemplated	1
with	1
suspicion	1
But	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
friends	1
dear	1
not	1
only	1
through	1
habit	1
and	1
association	1
but	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
merits	1
and	1
wherever	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
soothing	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
Clerval	1
will	1
be	1
ever	1
whispered	1
in	1
my	1
ear	1
They	1
are	1
dead	1
and	1
but	1
one	1
feeling	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
solitude	1
can	1
persuade	1
me	1
to	1
preserve	1
my	1
life	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
any	1
high	1
undertaking	1
or	1
design	1
fraught	1
with	1
extensive	1
utility	1
to	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
then	1
could	1
I	1
live	1
to	1
fulfil	1
it	1
But	1
such	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
destiny	1
I	1
must	1
pursue	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
being	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
gave	1
existence	1
then	1
my	1
lot	1
on	1
earth	1
will	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
die	1
My	1
beloved	1
Sister	1
September	1
2d	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
encompassed	1
by	1
peril	1
and	1
ignorant	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
ever	1
doomed	1
to	1
see	1
again	1
dear	1
England	1
and	1
the	1
dearer	1
friends	1
that	1
inhabit	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
surrounded	1
by	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
which	1
admit	1
of	1
no	1
escape	1
and	1
threaten	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
crush	1
my	1
vessel	1
The	1
brave	1
fellows	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
persuaded	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
companions	1
look	1
towards	1
me	1
for	1
aid	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
bestow	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
terribly	1
appalling	1
in	1
our	1
situation	1
yet	1
my	1
courage	1
and	1
hopes	1
do	1
not	1
desert	1
me	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
terrible	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
are	1
endangered	1
through	1
me	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
lost	1
my	1
mad	1
schemes	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
And	1
what	1
Margaret	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
your	1
mind	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
my	1
destruction	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
anxiously	1
await	1
my	1
return	1
Years	1
will	1
pass	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
visitings	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
tortured	1
by	1
hope	1
Oh	1
My	1
beloved	1
sister	1
the	1
sickening	1
failing	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
felt	1
expectations	1
is	1
in	1
prospect	1
more	1
terrible	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
death	1
But	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
lovely	1
children	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
happy	1
Heaven	1
bless	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
so	1
My	1
unfortunate	1
guest	1
regards	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
tenderest	1
compassion	1
He	1
endeavours	1
to	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
hope	1
and	1
talks	1
as	1
if	1
life	1
were	1
a	1
possession	1
which	1
he	1
valued	1
He	1
reminds	1
me	1
how	1
often	1
the	1
same	1
accidents	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
other	1
navigators	1
who	1
have	1
attempted	1
this	1
sea	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
myself	1
he	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
cheerful	1
auguries	1
Even	1
the	1
sailors	1
feel	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
eloquence	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1
they	1
no	1
longer	1
despair	1
he	1
rouses	1
their	1
energies	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
they	1
believe	1
these	1
vast	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
are	1
mole	1
hills	1
which	1
will	1
vanish	1
before	1
the	1
resolutions	1
of	1
man	1
These	1
feelings	1
are	1
transitory	1
each	1
day	1
of	1
expectation	1
delayed	1
fills	1
them	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
I	1
almost	1
dread	1
a	1
mutiny	1
caused	1
by	1
this	1
despair	1
September	1
5th	1
A	1
scene	1
has	1
just	1
passed	1
of	1
such	1
uncommon	1
interest	1
that	1
although	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
these	1
papers	1
may	1
never	1
reach	1
you	1
yet	1
I	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
recording	1
it	1
We	1
are	1
still	1
surrounded	1
by	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
still	1
in	1
imminent	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
crushed	1
in	1
their	1
conflict	1
The	1
cold	1
is	1
excessive	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
comrades	1
have	1
already	1
found	1
a	1
grave	1
amidst	1
this	1
scene	1
of	1
desolation	1
Frankenstein	1
has	1
daily	1
declined	1
in	1
health	1
a	1
feverish	1
fire	1
still	1
glimmers	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
exhausted	1
and	1
when	1
suddenly	1
roused	1
to	1
any	1
exertion	1
he	1
speedily	1
sinks	1
again	1
into	1
apparent	1
lifelessness	1
I	1
mentioned	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
letter	1
the	1
fears	1
I	1
entertained	1
of	1
a	1
mutiny	1
This	1
morning	1
as	1
I	1
sat	1
watching	1
the	1
wan	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
his	1
eyes	1
half	1
closed	1
and	1
his	1
limbs	1
hanging	1
listlessly	1
I	1
was	1
roused	1
by	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
of	1
the	1
sailors	1
who	1
demanded	1
admission	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
They	1
entered	1
and	1
their	1
leader	1
addressed	1
me	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
sailors	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
deputation	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
requisition	1
which	1
in	1
justice	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
We	1
were	1
immured	1
in	1
ice	1
and	1
should	1
probably	1
never	1
escape	1
but	1
they	1
feared	1
that	1
if	1
as	1
was	1
possible	1
the	1
ice	1
should	1
dissipate	1
and	1
a	1
free	1
passage	1
be	1
opened	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
rash	1
enough	1
to	1
continue	1
my	1
voyage	1
and	1
lead	1
them	1
into	1
fresh	1
dangers	1
after	1
they	1
might	1
happily	1
have	1
surmounted	1
this	1
They	1
insisted	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
engage	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
promise	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
vessel	1
should	1
be	1
freed	1
I	1
would	1
instantly	1
direct	1
my	1
course	1
southwards	1
This	1
speech	1
troubled	1
me	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
despaired	1
nor	1
had	1
I	1
yet	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
returning	1
if	1
set	1
free	1
Yet	1
could	1
I	1
in	1
justice	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
possibility	1
refuse	1
this	1
demand	1
I	1
hesitated	1
before	1
I	1
answered	1
when	1
Frankenstein	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
silent	1
and	1
indeed	1
appeared	1
hardly	1
to	1
have	1
force	1
enough	1
to	1
attend	1
now	1
roused	1
himself	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
flushed	1
with	1
momentary	1
vigour	1
Turning	1
towards	1
the	1
men	1
he	1
said	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
demand	1
of	1
your	1
captain	1
Are	1
you	1
then	1
so	1
easily	1
turned	1
from	1
your	1
design	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
call	1
this	1
a	1
glorious	1
expedition	1
And	1
wherefore	1
was	1
it	1
glorious	1
Not	1
because	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
smooth	1
and	1
placid	1
as	1
a	1
southern	1
sea	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
dangers	1
and	1
terror	1
because	1
at	1
every	1
new	1
incident	1
your	1
fortitude	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
forth	1
and	1
your	1
courage	1
exhibited	1
because	1
danger	1
and	1
death	1
surrounded	1
it	1
and	1
these	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
brave	1
and	1
overcome	1
For	1
this	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
glorious	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
it	1
an	1
honourable	1
undertaking	1
You	1
were	1
hereafter	1
to	1
be	1
hailed	1
as	1
the	1
benefactors	1
of	1
your	1
species	1
your	1
names	1
adored	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
brave	1
men	1
who	1
encountered	1
death	1
for	1
honour	1
and	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
mankind	1
And	1
now	1
behold	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
imagination	1
of	1
danger	1
or	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
the	1
first	1
mighty	1
and	1
terrific	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
courage	1
you	1
shrink	1
away	1
and	1
are	1
content	1
to	1
be	1
handed	1
down	1
as	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
strength	1
enough	1
to	1
endure	1
cold	1
and	1
peril	1
and	1
so	1
poor	1
souls	1
they	1
were	1
chilly	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
warm	1
firesides	1
Why	1
that	1
requires	1
not	1
this	1
preparation	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
thus	1
far	1
and	1
dragged	1
your	1
captain	1
to	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
a	1
defeat	1
merely	1
to	1
prove	1
yourselves	1
cowards	1
Oh	1
Be	1
men	1
or	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
men	1
Be	1
steady	1
to	1
your	1
purposes	1
and	1
firm	1
as	1
a	1
rock	1
This	1
ice	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
such	1
stuff	1
as	1
your	1
hearts	1
may	1
be	1
it	1
is	1
mutable	1
and	1
cannot	1
withstand	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
Do	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
families	1
with	1
the	1
stigma	1
of	1
disgrace	1
marked	1
on	1
your	1
brows	1
Return	1
as	1
heroes	1
who	1
have	1
fought	1
and	1
conquered	1
and	1
who	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
on	1
the	1
foe	1
He	1
spoke	1
this	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
so	1
modulated	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
feelings	1
expressed	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
lofty	1
design	1
and	1
heroism	1
that	1
can	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
moved	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
reply	1
I	1
spoke	1
I	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
retire	1
and	1
consider	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
lead	1
them	1
farther	1
north	1
if	1
they	1
strenuously	1
desired	1
the	1
contrary	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
hoped	1
that	1
with	1
reflection	1
their	1
courage	1
would	1
return	1
They	1
retired	1
and	1
I	1
turned	1
towards	1
my	1
friend	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
sunk	1
in	1
languor	1
and	1
almost	1
deprived	1
of	1
life	1
How	1
all	1
this	1
will	1
terminate	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
die	1
than	1
return	1
shamefully	1
my	1
purpose	1
unfulfilled	1
Yet	1
I	1
fear	1
such	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
fate	1
the	1
men	1
unsupported	1
by	1
ideas	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
can	1
never	1
willingly	1
continue	1
to	1
endure	1
their	1
present	1
hardships	1
September	1
7th	1
The	1
die	1
is	1
cast	1
I	1
have	1
consented	1
to	1
return	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
destroyed	1
Thus	1
are	1
my	1
hopes	1
blasted	1
by	1
cowardice	1
and	1
indecision	1
I	1
come	1
back	1
ignorant	1
and	1
disappointed	1
It	1
requires	1
more	1
philosophy	1
than	1
I	1
possess	1
to	1
bear	1
this	1
injustice	1
with	1
patience	1
September	1
12th	1
It	1
is	1
past	1
I	1
am	1
returning	1
to	1
England	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
hopes	1
of	1
utility	1
and	1
glory	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
friend	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
detail	1
these	1
bitter	1
circumstances	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
and	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
wafted	1
towards	1
England	1
and	1
towards	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
despond	1
September	1
9th	1
the	1
ice	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
and	1
roarings	1
like	1
thunder	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
as	1
the	1
islands	1
split	1
and	1
cracked	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
We	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
imminent	1
peril	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
remain	1
passive	1
my	1
chief	1
attention	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
guest	1
whose	1
illness	1
increased	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
confined	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
The	1
ice	1
cracked	1
behind	1
us	1
and	1
was	1
driven	1
with	1
force	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
a	1
breeze	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
11th	1
the	1
passage	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
became	1
perfectly	1
free	1
When	1
the	1
sailors	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
native	1
country	1
was	1
apparently	1
assured	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
tumultuous	1
joy	1
broke	1
from	1
them	1
loud	1
and	1
long	1
continued	1
Frankenstein	1
who	1
was	1
dozing	1
awoke	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
tumult	1
They	1
shout	1
I	1
said	1
because	1
they	1
will	1
soon	1
return	1
to	1
England	1
Do	1
you	1
then	1
really	1
return	1
Alas	1
Yes	1
I	1
cannot	1
withstand	1
their	1
demands	1
I	1
cannot	1
lead	1
them	1
unwillingly	1
to	1
danger	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
return	1
Do	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
You	1
may	1
give	1
up	1
your	1
purpose	1
but	1
mine	1
is	1
assigned	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
Heaven	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
I	1
am	1
weak	1
but	1
surely	1
the	1
spirits	1
who	1
assist	1
my	1
vengeance	1
will	1
endow	1
me	1
with	1
sufficient	1
strength	1
Saying	1
this	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
spring	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
but	1
the	1
exertion	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
and	1
fainted	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
restored	1
and	1
I	1
often	1
thought	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
entirely	1
extinct	1
At	1
length	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
breathed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
The	1
surgeon	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
composing	1
draught	1
and	1
ordered	1
us	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
undisturbed	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
friend	1
had	1
certainly	1
not	1
many	1
hours	1
to	1
live	1
His	1
sentence	1
was	1
pronounced	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
grieve	1
and	1
be	1
patient	1
I	1
sat	1
by	1
his	1
bed	1
watching	1
him	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
slept	1
but	1
presently	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
and	1
bidding	1
me	1
come	1
near	1
said	1
Alas	1
The	1
strength	1
I	1
relied	1
on	1
is	1
gone	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
die	1
and	1
he	1
my	1
enemy	1
and	1
persecutor	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
being	1
Think	1
not	1
Walton	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
my	1
existence	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
burning	1
hatred	1
and	1
ardent	1
desire	1
of	1
revenge	1
I	1
once	1
expressed	1
but	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
justified	1
in	1
desiring	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
adversary	1
During	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
occupied	1
in	1
examining	1
my	1
past	1
conduct	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
find	1
it	1
blamable	1
In	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
enthusiastic	1
madness	1
I	1
created	1
a	1
rational	1
creature	1
and	1
was	1
bound	1
towards	1
him	1
to	1
assure	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
his	1
happiness	1
and	1
well	1
being	1
This	1
was	1
my	1
duty	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
still	1
paramount	1
to	1
that	1
My	1
duties	1
towards	1
the	1
beings	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
species	1
had	1
greater	1
claims	1
to	1
my	1
attention	1
because	1
they	1
included	1
a	1
greater	1
proportion	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
misery	1
Urged	1
by	1
this	1
view	1
I	1
refused	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
right	1
in	1
refusing	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
companion	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
creature	1
He	1
showed	1
unparalleled	1
malignity	1
and	1
selfishness	1
in	1
evil	1
he	1
destroyed	1
my	1
friends	1
he	1
devoted	1
to	1
destruction	1
beings	1
who	1
possessed	1
exquisite	1
sensations	1
happiness	1
and	1
wisdom	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
this	1
thirst	1
for	1
vengeance	1
may	1
end	1
Miserable	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
render	1
no	1
other	1
wretched	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die	1
The	1
task	1
of	1
his	1
destruction	1
was	1
mine	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
failed	1
When	1
actuated	1
by	1
selfish	1
and	1
vicious	1
motives	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
to	1
undertake	1
my	1
unfinished	1
work	1
and	1
I	1
renew	1
this	1
request	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
induced	1
by	1
reason	1
and	1
virtue	1
Yet	1
I	1
cannot	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
renounce	1
your	1
country	1
and	1
friends	1
to	1
fulfil	1
this	1
task	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
returning	1
to	1
England	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
little	1
chance	1
of	1
meeting	1
with	1
him	1
But	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
these	1
points	1
and	1
the	1
well	1
balancing	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
esteem	1
your	1
duties	1
I	1
leave	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
judgment	1
and	1
ideas	1
are	1
already	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
near	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
right	1
for	1
I	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
misled	1
by	1
passion	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
live	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
mischief	1
disturbs	1
me	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
this	1
hour	1
when	1
I	1
momentarily	1
expect	1
my	1
release	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
happy	1
one	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
The	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
beloved	1
dead	1
flit	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
hasten	1
to	1
their	1
arms	1
Farewell	1
Walton	1
Seek	1
happiness	1
in	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
avoid	1
ambition	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
the	1
apparently	1
innocent	1
one	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
yourself	1
in	1
science	1
and	1
discoveries	1
Yet	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
I	1
have	1
myself	1
been	1
blasted	1
in	1
these	1
hopes	1
yet	1
another	1
may	1
succeed	1
His	1
voice	1
became	1
fainter	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
exhausted	1
by	1
his	1
effort	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
silence	1
About	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
afterwards	1
he	1
attempted	1
again	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
he	1
pressed	1
my	1
hand	1
feebly	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
for	1
ever	1
while	1
the	1
irradiation	1
of	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1
Margaret	1
what	1
comment	1
can	1
I	1
make	1
on	1
the	1
untimely	1
extinction	1
of	1
this	1
glorious	1
spirit	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
will	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
my	1
sorrow	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
express	1
would	1
be	1
inadequate	1
and	1
feeble	1
My	1
tears	1
flow	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
overshadowed	1
by	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
disappointment	1
But	1
I	1
journey	1
towards	1
England	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
there	1
find	1
consolation	1
I	1
am	1
interrupted	1
What	1
do	1
these	1
sounds	1
portend	1
It	1
is	1
midnight	1
the	1
breeze	1
blows	1
fairly	1
and	1
the	1
watch	1
on	1
deck	1
scarcely	1
stir	1
Again	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
voice	1
but	1
hoarser	1
it	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
where	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
Frankenstein	1
still	1
lie	1
I	1
must	1
arise	1
and	1
examine	1
Good	1
night	1
my	1
sister	1
Great	1
God	1
what	1
a	1
scene	1
has	1
just	1
taken	1
place	1
I	1
am	1
yet	1
dizzy	1
with	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
detail	1
it	1
yet	1
the	1
tale	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
recorded	1
would	1
be	1
incomplete	1
without	1
this	1
final	1
and	1
wonderful	1
catastrophe	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
cabin	1
where	1
lay	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
my	1
ill	1
fated	1
and	1
admirable	1
friend	1
Over	1
him	1
hung	1
a	1
form	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
describe	1
gigantic	1
in	1
stature	1
yet	1
uncouth	1
and	1
distorted	1
in	1
its	1
proportions	1
As	1
he	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
coffin	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
concealed	1
by	1
long	1
locks	1
of	1
ragged	1
hair	1
but	1
one	1
vast	1
hand	1
was	1
extended	1
in	1
colour	1
and	1
apparent	1
texture	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
mummy	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
my	1
approach	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
utter	1
exclamations	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
horror	1
and	1
sprung	1
towards	1
the	1
window	1
Never	1
did	1
I	1
behold	1
a	1
vision	1
so	1
horrible	1
as	1
his	1
face	1
of	1
such	1
loathsome	1
yet	1
appalling	1
hideousness	1
I	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
involuntarily	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
recollect	1
what	1
were	1
my	1
duties	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
destroyer	1
I	1
called	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
He	1
paused	1
looking	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
again	1
turning	1
towards	1
the	1
lifeless	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
creator	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
forget	1
my	1
presence	1
and	1
every	1
feature	1
and	1
gesture	1
seemed	1
instigated	1
by	1
the	1
wildest	1
rage	1
of	1
some	1
uncontrollable	1
passion	1
That	1
is	1
also	1
my	1
victim	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
In	1
his	1
murder	1
my	1
crimes	1
are	1
consummated	1
the	1
miserable	1
series	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
is	1
wound	1
to	1
its	1
close	1
Oh	1
Frankenstein	1
Generous	1
and	1
self	1
devoted	1
being	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
avail	1
that	1
I	1
now	1
ask	1
thee	1
to	1
pardon	1
me	1
I	1
who	1
irretrievably	1
destroyed	1
thee	1
by	1
destroying	1
all	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
Alas	1
He	1
is	1
cold	1
he	1
cannot	1
answer	1
me	1
His	1
voice	1
seemed	1
suffocated	1
and	1
my	1
first	1
impulses	1
which	1
had	1
suggested	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
obeying	1
the	1
dying	1
request	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
in	1
destroying	1
his	1
enemy	1
were	1
now	1
suspended	1
by	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
compassion	1
I	1
approached	1
this	1
tremendous	1
being	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
again	1
raise	1
my	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
so	1
scaring	1
and	1
unearthly	1
in	1
his	1
ugliness	1
I	1
attempted	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
died	1
away	1
on	1
my	1
lips	1
The	1
monster	1
continued	1
to	1
utter	1
wild	1
and	1
incoherent	1
self	1
reproaches	1
At	1
length	1
I	1
gathered	1
resolution	1
to	1
address	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
the	1
tempest	1
of	1
his	1
passion	1
Your	1
repentance	1
I	1
said	1
is	1
now	1
superfluous	1
If	1
you	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
conscience	1
and	1
heeded	1
the	1
stings	1
of	1
remorse	1
before	1
you	1
had	1
urged	1
your	1
diabolical	1
vengeance	1
to	1
this	1
extremity	1
Frankenstein	1
would	1
yet	1
have	1
lived	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
dream	1
said	1
the	1
daemon	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
dead	1
to	1
agony	1
and	1
remorse	1
He	1
he	1
continued	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
corpse	1
he	1
suffered	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
consummation	1
of	1
the	1
deed	1
Oh	1
Not	1
the	1
ten	1
thousandth	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
anguish	1
that	1
was	1
mine	1
during	1
the	1
lingering	1
detail	1
of	1
its	1
execution	1
A	1
frightful	1
selfishness	1
hurried	1
me	1
on	1
while	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
poisoned	1
with	1
remorse	1
Think	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
groans	1
of	1
Clerval	1
were	1
music	1
to	1
my	1
ears	1
My	1
heart	1
was	1
fashioned	1
to	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
sympathy	1
and	1
when	1
wrenched	1
by	1
misery	1
to	1
vice	1
and	1
hatred	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
endure	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
without	1
torture	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
cannot	1
even	1
imagine	1
After	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
Clerval	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
Switzerland	1
heart	1
broken	1
and	1
overcome	1
I	1
pitied	1
Frankenstein	1
my	1
pity	1
amounted	1
to	1
horror	1
I	1
abhorred	1
myself	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
the	1
author	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
my	1
existence	1
and	1
of	1
its	1
unspeakable	1
torments	1
dared	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
happiness	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
accumulated	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
despair	1
upon	1
me	1
he	1
sought	1
his	1
own	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
feelings	1
and	1
passions	1
from	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
for	1
ever	1
barred	1
then	1
impotent	1
envy	1
and	1
bitter	1
indignation	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
an	1
insatiable	1
thirst	1
for	1
vengeance	1
I	1
recollected	1
my	1
threat	1
and	1
resolved	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
accomplished	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
preparing	1
for	1
myself	1
a	1
deadly	1
torture	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
slave	1
not	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
an	1
impulse	1
which	1
I	1
detested	1
yet	1
could	1
not	1
disobey	1
Yet	1
when	1
she	1
died	1
Nay	1
then	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
miserable	1
I	1
had	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
feeling	1
subdued	1
all	1
anguish	1
to	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
my	1
despair	1
Evil	1
thenceforth	1
became	1
my	1
good	1
Urged	1
thus	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
adapt	1
my	1
nature	1
to	1
an	1
element	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
willingly	1
chosen	1
The	1
completion	1
of	1
my	1
demoniacal	1
design	1
became	1
an	1
insatiable	1
passion	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
ended	1
there	1
is	1
my	1
last	1
victim	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
touched	1
by	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
misery	1
yet	1
when	1
I	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
what	1
Frankenstein	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
powers	1
of	1
eloquence	1
and	1
persuasion	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
again	1
cast	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
lifeless	1
form	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
indignation	1
was	1
rekindled	1
within	1
me	1
Wretch	1
I	1
said	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
that	1
you	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
whine	1
over	1
the	1
desolation	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
You	1
throw	1
a	1
torch	1
into	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
buildings	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
consumed	1
you	1
sit	1
among	1
the	1
ruins	1
and	1
lament	1
the	1
fall	1
Hypocritical	1
fiend	1
If	1
he	1
whom	1
you	1
mourn	1
still	1
lived	1
still	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
object	1
again	1
would	1
he	1
become	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
your	1
accursed	1
vengeance	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
pity	1
that	1
you	1
feel	1
you	1
lament	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
your	1
malignity	1
is	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
your	1
power	1
Oh	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
thus	1
not	1
thus	1
interrupted	1
the	1
being	1
Yet	1
such	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
impression	1
conveyed	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
my	1
actions	1
Yet	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
a	1
fellow	1
feeling	1
in	1
my	1
misery	1
No	1
sympathy	1
may	1
I	1
ever	1
find	1
When	1
I	1
first	1
sought	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
virtue	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
affection	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
whole	1
being	1
overflowed	1
that	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
participated	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
virtue	1
has	1
become	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
shadow	1
and	1
that	1
happiness	1
and	1
affection	1
are	1
turned	1
into	1
bitter	1
and	1
loathing	1
despair	1
in	1
what	1
should	1
I	1
seek	1
for	1
sympathy	1
I	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
suffer	1
alone	1
while	1
my	1
sufferings	1
shall	1
endure	1
when	1
I	1
die	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
satisfied	1
that	1
abhorrence	1
and	1
opprobrium	1
should	1
load	1
my	1
memory	1
Once	1
my	1
fancy	1
was	1
soothed	1
with	1
dreams	1
of	1
virtue	1
of	1
fame	1
and	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
Once	1
I	1
falsely	1
hoped	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
beings	1
who	1
pardoning	1
my	1
outward	1
form	1
would	1
love	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
excellent	1
qualities	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
unfolding	1
I	1
was	1
nourished	1
with	1
high	1
thoughts	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
devotion	1
But	1
now	1
crime	1
has	1
degraded	1
me	1
beneath	1
the	1
meanest	1
animal	1
No	1
guilt	1
no	1
mischief	1
no	1
malignity	1
no	1
misery	1
can	1
be	1
found	1
comparable	1
to	1
mine	1
When	1
I	1
run	1
over	1
the	1
frightful	1
catalogue	1
of	1
my	1
sins	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
creature	1
whose	1
thoughts	1
were	1
once	1
filled	1
with	1
sublime	1
and	1
transcendent	1
visions	1
of	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
goodness	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
fallen	1
angel	1
becomes	1
a	1
malignant	1
devil	1
Yet	1
even	1
that	1
enemy	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
man	1
had	1
friends	1
and	1
associates	1
in	1
his	1
desolation	1
I	1
am	1
alone	1
You	1
who	1
call	1
Frankenstein	1
your	1
friend	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
crimes	1
and	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
detail	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
you	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sum	1
up	1
the	1
hours	1
and	1
months	1
of	1
misery	1
which	1
I	1
endured	1
wasting	1
in	1
impotent	1
passions	1
For	1
while	1
I	1
destroyed	1
his	1
hopes	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
satisfy	1
my	1
own	1
desires	1
They	1
were	1
for	1
ever	1
ardent	1
and	1
craving	1
still	1
I	1
desired	1
love	1
and	1
fellowship	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
spurned	1
Was	1
there	1
no	1
injustice	1
in	1
this	1
Am	1
I	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
the	1
only	1
criminal	1
when	1
all	1
humankind	1
sinned	1
against	1
me	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
hate	1
Felix	1
who	1
drove	1
his	1
friend	1
from	1
his	1
door	1
with	1
contumely	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
execrate	1
the	1
rustic	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
saviour	1
of	1
his	1
child	1
Nay	1
these	1
are	1
virtuous	1
and	1
immaculate	1
beings	1
I	1
the	1
miserable	1
and	1
the	1
abandoned	1
am	1
an	1
abortion	1
to	1
be	1
spurned	1
at	1
and	1
kicked	1
and	1
trampled	1
on	1
Even	1
now	1
my	1
blood	1
boils	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
this	1
injustice	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
wretch	1
I	1
have	1
murdered	1
the	1
lovely	1
and	1
the	1
helpless	1
I	1
have	1
strangled	1
the	1
innocent	1
as	1
they	1
slept	1
and	1
grasped	1
to	1
death	1
his	1
throat	1
who	1
never	1
injured	1
me	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
living	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
devoted	1
my	1
creator	1
the	1
select	1
specimen	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
admiration	1
among	1
men	1
to	1
misery	1
I	1
have	1
pursued	1
him	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
irremediable	1
ruin	1
There	1
he	1
lies	1
white	1
and	1
cold	1
in	1
death	1
You	1
hate	1
me	1
but	1
your	1
abhorrence	1
cannot	1
equal	1
that	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
regard	1
myself	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
executed	1
the	1
deed	1
I	1
think	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
conceived	1
and	1
long	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
these	1
hands	1
will	1
meet	1
my	1
eyes	1
when	1
that	1
imagination	1
will	1
haunt	1
my	1
thoughts	1
no	1
more	1
Fear	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
future	1
mischief	1
My	1
work	1
is	1
nearly	1
complete	1
Neither	1
yours	1
nor	1
any	1
man	1
s	1
death	1
is	1
needed	1
to	1
consummate	1
the	1
series	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
and	1
accomplish	1
that	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
it	1
requires	1
my	1
own	1
Do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
slow	1
to	1
perform	1
this	1
sacrifice	1
I	1
shall	1
quit	1
your	1
vessel	1
on	1
the	1
ice	1
raft	1
which	1
brought	1
me	1
thither	1
and	1
shall	1
seek	1
the	1
most	1
northern	1
extremity	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
I	1
shall	1
collect	1
my	1
funeral	1
pile	1
and	1
consume	1
to	1
ashes	1
this	1
miserable	1
frame	1
that	1
its	1
remains	1
may	1
afford	1
no	1
light	1
to	1
any	1
curious	1
and	1
unhallowed	1
wretch	1
who	1
would	1
create	1
such	1
another	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
longer	1
feel	1
the	1
agonies	1
which	1
now	1
consume	1
me	1
or	1
be	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
feelings	1
unsatisfied	1
yet	1
unquenched	1
He	1
is	1
dead	1
who	1
called	1
me	1
into	1
being	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
very	1
remembrance	1
of	1
us	1
both	1
will	1
speedily	1
vanish	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
sun	1
or	1
stars	1
or	1
feel	1
the	1
winds	1
play	1
on	1
my	1
cheeks	1
Light	1
feeling	1
and	1
sense	1
will	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
condition	1
must	1
I	1
find	1
my	1
happiness	1
Some	1
years	1
ago	1
when	1
the	1
images	1
which	1
this	1
world	1
affords	1
first	1
opened	1
upon	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
cheering	1
warmth	1
of	1
summer	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
the	1
warbling	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
wept	1
to	1
die	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
consolation	1
Polluted	1
by	1
crimes	1
and	1
torn	1
by	1
the	1
bitterest	1
remorse	1
where	1
can	1
I	1
find	1
rest	1
but	1
in	1
death	1
Farewell	1
I	1
leave	1
you	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
humankind	1
whom	1
these	1
eyes	1
will	1
ever	1
behold	1
Farewell	1
Frankenstein	1
If	1
thou	1
wert	1
yet	1
alive	1
and	1
yet	1
cherished	1
a	1
desire	1
of	1
revenge	1
against	1
me	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
satiated	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
than	1
in	1
my	1
destruction	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
thou	1
didst	1
seek	1
my	1
extinction	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
cause	1
greater	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
if	1
yet	1
in	1
some	1
mode	1
unknown	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
feel	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
not	1
desire	1
against	1
me	1
a	1
vengeance	1
greater	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
Blasted	1
as	1
thou	1
wert	1
my	1
agony	1
was	1
still	1
superior	1
to	1
thine	1
for	1
the	1
bitter	1
sting	1
of	1
remorse	1
will	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
rankle	1
in	1
my	1
wounds	1
until	1
death	1
shall	1
close	1
them	1
for	1
ever	1
But	1
soon	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
sad	1
and	1
solemn	1
enthusiasm	1
I	1
shall	1
die	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
feel	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
felt	1
Soon	1
these	1
burning	1
miseries	1
will	1
be	1
extinct	1
I	1
shall	1
ascend	1
my	1
funeral	1
pile	1
triumphantly	1
and	1
exult	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
torturing	1
flames	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
that	1
conflagration	1
will	1
fade	1
away	1
my	1
ashes	1
will	1
be	1
swept	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
the	1
winds	1
My	1
spirit	1
will	1
sleep	1
in	1
peace	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
thinks	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
surely	1
think	1
thus	1
Farewell	1
He	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
window	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
upon	1
the	1
ice	1
raft	1
which	1
lay	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
vessel	1
He	1
was	1
soon	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
and	1
lost	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
distance	1

Scepticism	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
knowledge	1
as	1
knowledge	1
is	1
of	1
scepticism	1
To	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
at	1
present	1
know	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
to	1
shut	1
our	1
ears	1
against	1
conviction	1
since	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
gradual	1
character	1
of	1
our	1
education	1
we	1
must	1
continually	1
forget	1
and	1
emancipate	1
ourselves	1
from	1
knowledge	1
previously	1
acquired	1
we	1
must	1
set	1
aside	1
old	1
notions	1
and	1
embrace	1
fresh	1
ones	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
learn	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
daily	1
unlearning	1
something	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
us	1
no	1
small	1
labour	1
and	1
anxiety	1
to	1
acquire	1
And	1
this	1
difficulty	1
attaches	1
itself	1
more	1
closely	1
to	1
an	1
age	1
in	1
which	1
progress	1
has	1
gained	1
a	1
strong	1
ascendency	1
over	1
prejudice	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
persons	1
and	1
things	1
are	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
finding	1
their	1
real	1
level	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
their	1
conventional	1
value	1
The	1
same	1
principles	1
which	1
have	1
swept	1

abuses	1

which	1
are	1
making	1
rapid	1
havoc	1
among	1
the	1

stripping	1
the	1

The	1

thing	1

As	1
a	1
step	1
towards	1
that	1
conclusion	1
Wolf	1
maintained	1
that	1
no	1

of	1
either	1
poem	1
could	1
be	1

have	1
existed	1

their	1

referred	1

that	1
without	1
writing	1
neither	1
the	1
perfect	1

must	1
be	1

supposed	1
for	1

it	1

it	1
has	1
been	1
considered	1
incumbent	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
defended	1
the	1
ancient	1
aggregate	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1

to	1
maintain	1
that	1
they	1
were	1

be	1
fixed	1
upon	1
as	1
having	1

of	1

narrowest	1

I	1
ground	1
this	1
supposition	1
on	1
the	1
change	1
then	1
operated	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
tendencies	1
of	1
Grecian	1
poetry	1
and	1
music^a	1
the	1
elegiac	1
and	1
the	1
iambic	1
measures	1
having	1
been	1
introduced	1
as	1
rivals	1
to	1
the	1
primitive	1
hexameter	1

from	1
the	1
epical	1
past	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
present	1

life	1
Such	1
a	1
change	1
was	1
important	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
poetry	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
known	1
mode	1
of	1
publication	1
to	1
use	1
a	1
modern	1
phrase	1
not	1
altogether	1
suitable	1
yet	1
the	1
nearest	1
approaching	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
It	1
argued	1
a	1
new	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
epical	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
thirst	1
for	1
new	1
poetical	1
effect	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
stood	1
forward	1
in	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
desirous	1
to	1
study	1
and	1
competent	1
to	1
criticize	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
individual	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
the	1
written	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Homeric	1
rhapsodies	1
just	1

eulogized	1

for	1
conjecturing	1

would	1
doubtless	1
slowly	1
increase	1

the	1

the	1
total	1
absence	1
of	1

perhaps	1
no	1

In	1

it	1
may	1
fairly	1
be	1
suspected	1
in	1

the	1

to	1

is	1
possible	1
indeed	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
leading	1
outline	1
the	1
Iliad	1
may	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
historic	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
maritime	1
expedition	1

have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
ally	1
of	1
the	1
Peloponnesian	1
sovereign	1
the	1
preeminent	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
poetry	1
on	1
the	1
Trojan	1
war	1
may	1
thus	1
have	1
forced	1
the	1
national	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
Athenians	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
their	1
taste	1
The	1
songs	1
which	1
spoke	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
great	1
ancestor	1
were	1
no	1

of	1
far	1
inferior	1
sublimity	1

popularity	1

at	1
first	1
sight	1
a	1
Theseid	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
emanated	1
from	1
an	1
Athenian	1
synod	1
of	1
compilers	1
of	1
pg	1

Homeric	1
ballads	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
sometimes	1
called	1
which	1
related	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
Achilles	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
direful	1
consequences	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1

it	1
is	1
still	1
surprising	1
that	1

callida	1
junctura	1
should	1
never	1
betray	1
the	1

that	1
the	1

rather	1
augmented	1

otherwise	1

his	1
hypothesis	1
Nor	1
is	1
Lachmann^a	1

modification	1
of	1
his	1
theory	1
any	1
better	1
He	1
divides	1
the	1
first	1
twenty	1
two	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
into	1
sixteen	1
different	1
songs	1
and	1
treats	1
as	1
ridiculous	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
their	1
amalgamation	1
into	1
one	1
regular	1
poem	1
belongs	1
to	1
a	1
period	1
earlier	1
than	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
Peisistratus	1

as	1
Grote	1
observes	1

gaps	1

^a	1
Moreover	1
we	1
find	1
no	1
contradictions	1

this	1
belief	1

the	1
so	1

sixteen	1

On	1
the	1
whole	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
Peisistratus	1
were	1
wholly	1
of	1
an	1
editorial	1
character	1
although	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
lay	1
down	1
nothing	1
respecting	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
his	1
labours	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
believing	1
that	1
the	1
composition	1
or	1
primary	1
arrangement	1
of	1
these	1
poems	1
in	1
their	1
present	1
form	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Peisistratus	1
I	1
am	1
rather	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
fine	1
taste	1
and	1
elegant	1
mind	1
of	1
that	1
Athenian31	1
would	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
preserve	1
an	1
ancient	1
and	1
traditional	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
poems	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
patch	1
and	1
re	1
construct	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
a	1
fanciful	1
hypothesis	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
repeat	1
the	1
many	1
discussions	1
respecting	1
whether	1
the	1
poems	1
were	1
written	1
or	1
not	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
writing	1
was	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
reputed	1
author	1
Suffice	1
it	1
to	1
say	1
that	1

more	1
we	1

satisfied	1
we	1
are	1
upon	1

subject	1

I	1
cannot	1
however	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
which	1
attributes	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
these	1
poems	1
to	1
Lycurgus	1
is	1
little	1
else	1
than	1
a	1
version	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
story	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Peisistratus	1
while	1
its	1
historical	1
probability	1
must	1
be	1
measured	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
many	1
others	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
Spartan	1
Confucius	1
I	1
will	1
conclude	1
this	1
sketch	1
of	1
the	1
Homeric	1
theories	1
with	1
an	1
attempt	1
made	1
by	1
an	1
ingenious	1
friend	1
to	1
unite	1
them	1
into	1
something	1
like	1
consistency	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
follows	1
^a	1

oeNo	1
doubt	1
the	1
common	1

extemporaneous	1

a	1

down	1

merely	1
recitations	1

a	1

dialect	1

Crete	1

some	1

notion	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
theories	1
which	1
have	1
developed	1
themselves	1
respecting	1
this	1
most	1
interesting	1
subject	1
I	1
must	1
still	1
express	1
my	1
conviction	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
authorship	1
of	1
the	1
Homeric	1
poems	1
To	1
deny	1
that	1
many	1
corruptions	1
and	1
interpolations	1
disfigure	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
intrusive	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
poetasters	1
may	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
have	1
inflicted	1
a	1
wound	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
the	1
negligence	1
of	1
the	1
copyist	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
absurd	1
and	1
captious	1
assumption	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
criticism	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
appeal	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
either	1
understand	1
or	1
enjoy	1
these	1
poems	1
In	1
maintaining	1
the	1
authenticity	1
and	1
personality	1
of	1
their	1
one	1
author	1

	1
I	1
feel	1
conscious	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
whole	1
weight	1
of	1
historical	1
evidence	1
is	1
against	1
the	1
hypothesis	1
which	1
would	1
assign	1
these	1
great	1
works	1
to	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
authors	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
internal	1
evidence	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
springs	1
from	1
the	1
deepest	1
and	1
most	1
immediate	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
also	1
speaks	1
eloquently	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
The	1
minutiae	1
of	1
verbal	1
criticism	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
seeking	1
to	1
despise	1
Indeed	1
considering	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
books	1
such	1
an	1
attempt	1
would	1
be	1
gross	1
inconsistency	1
But	1
while	1
I	1
appreciate	1
its	1
importance	1
in	1
a	1
philological	1
view	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
set	1
little	1
store	1
on	1
its	1
aesthetic	1
value	1
especially	1
in	1
poetry	1
Three	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
emendations	1
made	1
upon	1
poets	1
are	1
mere	1
alterations	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
they	1
been	1
suggested	1
to	1
the	1
author	1
by	1
his	1
Maecenas	1
or	1
Africanus	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
adopted	1
Moreover	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
most	1
exact	1
in	1
laying	1
down	1
rules	1
of	1
verbal	1
criticism	1
and	1
interpretation	1
are	1
often	1
least	1
competent	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
their	1
own	1
precepts	1
Grammarians	1
are	1
not	1
poets	1
by	1
profession	1
but	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
per	1
accidens	1
	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
remember	1
two	1
emendations	1
on	1
Homer	1
calculated	1
to	1
substantially	1
improve	1
the	1
poetry	1
of	1
a	1
passage	1
although	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
remarks	1
from	1
Herodotus	1
down	1
to	1
Loewe	1
have	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
minute	1
points	1
without	1

our	1

phraseology	1
with	1
which	1

were	1
more	1

few	1

~A	1

of	1
Virgil	1

the	1

were	1

nay	1
the	1
refined	1
acuteness^a	1
which	1
scholars	1
like	1

have	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
this	1
subject	1
I	1
must	1
express	1
my	1
fears	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
modern	1
Homeric	1
theories	1
will	1
become	1
matter	1
for	1
the	1
surprise	1
and	1
entertainment	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
posterity	1
Nor	1
can	1
I	1
help	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
literary	1
history	1
of	1
more	1
recent	1
times	1
will	1
account	1
for	1
many	1
points	1
of	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
transmission	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
and	1
Odyssey	1
to	1
a	1
period	1
so	1
remote	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
first	1
creation	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
expressed	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
Peisistratus	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
purely	1
editorial	1
character	1
and	1
there	1
seems	1
no	1
more	1
reason	1
why	1
corrupt	1
and	1
imperfect	1
editions	1
of	1
Homer	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
abroad	1
in	1
his	1
day	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
poems	1
of	1
Valerius	1
Flaccus	1
and	1
Tibullus	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
so	1
much	1
trouble	1
to	1
Poggio	1
Scaliger	1
and	1
others	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
main	1
fault	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
Homeric	1
theories	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
demand	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
those	1
feelings	1
to	1
which	1
poetry	1
most	1
powerfully	1
appeals	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
its	1
most	1
fitting	1
judges	1
The	1
ingenuity	1
which	1
has	1
sought	1
to	1
rob	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
and	1
existence	1
of	1
Homer	1
does	1
too	1
much	1
violence	1
to	1
that	1
inward	1
emotion	1
which	1
makes	1
our	1
whole	1
soul	1
yearn	1
with	1
love	1
and	1
admiration	1
for	1
the	1
blind	1
bard	1
of	1
Chios	1
To	1
believe	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
a	1
mere	1
compiler	1
is	1
to	1
degrade	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
human	1
invention	1
to	1
elevate	1
analytical	1
judgment	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
ennobling	1
impulses	1
of	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
ocean	1
in	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
a	1
polypus	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
catholicity	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
name	1
of	1
Homer	1
Our	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
mistaken	1
one	1
but	1
as	1
yet	1
nobody	1
has	1
taught	1
us	1
a	1
better	1
While	1
however	1
I	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
belief	1
in	1
Homer	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
nature	1
herself	1
for	1
its	1
mainspring	1
while	1
I	1
can	1
join	1
with	1
old	1
Ennius	1
in	1
believing	1
in	1
Homer	1
as	1
the	1
ghost	1
who	1
like	1
some	1
patron	1
saint	1
hovers	1
round	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
and	1
even	1
bestows	1
rare	1
gifts	1
from	1
that	1
wealth	1
of	1
imagination	1
which	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
imitators	1
could	1
not	1
exhaust	1
^a	1
still	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
wishing	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
these	1
great	1
poems	1
found	1
a	1
rich	1
fund	1
of	1
tradition	1
a	1
well	1
stocked	1
mythical	1
storehouse	1
from	1
whence	1
pg	1
xxvii	1
he	1
might	1
derive	1
both	1
subject	1
and	1
embellishment	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
use	1
existing	1
romances	1
in	1
the	1
embellishment	1
of	1
a	1
poem	1
another	1
to	1
patch	1
up	1
the	1
poem	1
itself	1
from	1
such	1
materials	1
What	1
consistency	1
of	1
style	1
and	1
execution	1
can	1
be	1
hoped	1
for	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
attempt	1
or	1
rather	1
what	1
bad	1
taste	1
and	1
tedium	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
infallible	1
result	1
A	1
blending	1
of	1
popular	1
legends	1
and	1
a	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
other	1
bards	1
are	1
features	1
perfectly	1
consistent	1
with	1
poetical	1
originality	1
In	1
fact	1
the	1
most	1
original	1
writer	1
is	1
still	1
drawing	1
upon	1
outward	1
impressions^a	1
nay	1
even	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
are	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
secondary	1
agents	1

support	1

the	1

for	1
opposing	1
my	1
belief	1
it	1
still	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
Homeric	1
question	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
a	1
higher	1
criticism	1
than	1
it	1
has	1
often	1
obtained	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
by	1
nature	1
intended	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
things	1
still	1
less	1
to	1
compass	1
the	1
powers	1
by	1
which	1
the	1

have	1
been	1
placed	1
at	1

we	1
might	1
indeed	1
wonder	1
why	1
God	1
willed	1
our	1
ignorance	1
on	1
any	1
matter	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
well	1
taught	1
the	1
contrary	1
lesson	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
our	1
faith	1
should	1
be	1
especially	1
tried	1
touching	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
have	1
wrought	1
most	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
humanity	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
sacredness	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
bid	1
us	1
repulse	1
the	1
scepticism	1
which	1
would	1
allegorize	1
their	1
existence	1
into	1

Long	1

to	1
familiarize	1
our	1
thoughts	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
incongruities	1

if	1
we	1
read	1
in	1
a	1

with	1
a	1
heartfelt	1
appreciation	1
we	1
are	1
too	1
much	1
dazzled	1

deeply	1
wrapped	1
in	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
minute	1
spots	1
which	1
mere	1
analysis	1
can	1
discover	1
In	1
reading	1
an	1
heroic	1
poem	1
we	1
must	1
transform	1
ourselves	1
into	1
heroes	1
of	1
the	1
time	1

in	1

must	1
fight	1
over	1

with	1
the	1

a	1
Hector	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
can	1
but	1
attain	1
this	1
degree	1
of	1
enthusiasm	1

less	1
enthusiasm	1
will	1
scarcely	1
suffice	1
for	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1

we	1
shall	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
poems	1
of	1
Homer	1

not	1
only	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
one	1
writer	1

of	1
the	1

writer	1
that	1
ever	1
touched	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
men	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
song	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
supposed	1
unity	1
of	1
authorship	1
which	1
gave	1
these	1

No	1

in	1

the	1

ancient	1
writings	1
As	1
to	1
this	1
little	1
poem	1
being	1
a	1
youthful	1
prolusion	1
of	1
Homer	1
it	1
seems	1
sufficient	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
plain	1
and	1
palpable	1
parody	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
spirit	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
passages	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
itself	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
no	1
such	1
intention	1
to	1
parody	1
were	1
discernible	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
objection	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
that	1
to	1
suppose	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
mere	1
burlesque	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
primary	1
effort	1
of	1
poetry	1
in	1
a	1
simple	1
age	1
seems	1
to	1
reverse	1
that	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
national	1
taste	1
which	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
every	1
other	1
people	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
of	1
many	1
in	1
Asia	1
has	1
almost	1
ascertained	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
society	1
much	1
more	1
refined	1
and	1
permanent	1
than	1
that	1
described	1
in	1
the	1
Iliad	1
that	1
any	1
popularity	1
would	1
attend	1
such	1
a	1
ridicule	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
as	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
this	1
poem	1
and	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
there	1
having	1
existed	1
three	1
other	1
poems	1
of	1
the	1

kind	1
attributed	1
for	1
aught	1
we	1
can	1
see	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
reason	1
to	1
Homer	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
inducement	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1

by	1
the	1
Asiatic	1

for	1
that	1
purpose	1
that	1
this	1
poem	1
was	1
another	1
offspring	1
of	1
Attic	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
generally	1
that	1
the	1
familiar	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1

v	1

is	1
a	1
strong	1
argument	1
against	1
so	1
ancient	1
a	1
date	1
for	1
its	1
composition	1
^a	1
Having	1
thus	1
given	1
a	1
brief	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
poems	1
comprised	1
in	1
Pope^a	1
s	1
design	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
few	1
remarks	1
on	1
his	1
translation	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
purpose	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
edition	1
Pope	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
Grecian	1
His	1
whole	1
education	1
had	1
been	1
irregular	1
and	1
his	1
earliest	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
poet	1
was	1
through	1
the	1
version	1
of	1
Ogilby	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
work	1
bears	1
the	1
impress	1
of	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
dive	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
minute	1
and	1
delicate	1
features	1
of	1
language	1
Hence	1
his	1
whole	1
work	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
rather	1
as	1
an	1
elegant	1
paraphrase	1
than	1
a	1
translation	1
There	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
certain	1
conventional	1
anecdotes	1
which	1
prove	1
that	1
Pope	1
consulted	1
various	1
friends	1
whose	1
classical	1
attainments	1
were	1
sounder	1
than	1
his	1
own	1
during	1
the	1
undertaking	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
these	1
examinations	1
were	1
the	1
result	1
rather	1
of	1
the	1
contradictory	1
versions	1
already	1
existing	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
perfect	1
transcript	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
literal	1
translation	1
was	1
less	1
cultivated	1
than	1
at	1
present	1
If	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
could	1
be	1
decorated	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
gracefulness	1
of	1
a	1
practised	1
poet	1
if	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
metrical	1
cadence	1
and	1
a	1
pleasing	1
fluency	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
consistent	1
with	1
a	1
fair	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
poet^a	1
s	1
meaning	1
his	1
words	1
were	1
less	1
jealously	1
sought	1
for	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
read	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
poem	1
as	1
Pope^a	1
s	1
Iliad	1
had	1
fair	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
absurd	1
therefore	1
to	1
test	1
Pope^a	1
s	1
translation	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
advancing	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
text	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
pg	1
xxx	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
delightful	1
work	1
in	1
itself	1
^a	1
a	1
work	1
which	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
English	1
literature	1
as	1
Homer	1
himself	1
is	1
of	1
Greek	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
torn	1
from	1
our	1
kindly	1
associations	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
Iliad	1
that	1
once	1
was	1
our	1
most	1
cherished	1
companion	1
or	1
our	1
most	1
looked	1
for	1
prize	1
merely	1
because	1
Buttmann	1
Loewe	1
and	1
Liddell	1
have	1
made	1
us	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
accurate	1
as	1
to	1
amphikupellon	1
being	1
an	1
adjective	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
substantive	1
Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
us	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
Pope	1
especially	1
when	1
we	1
think	1
of	1
Chapman^a	1
s	1
fine	1
bold	1
rough	1
old	1
English	1
^a	1
far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
us	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
his	1
translation	1
as	1
what	1
a	1
translation	1
of	1
Homer	1
might	1
be	1
But	1
we	1
can	1
still	1
dismiss	1
Pope^a	1
s	1
Iliad	1
to	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
readers	1
with	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
read	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
books	1
before	1
they	1
have	1
read	1

As	1
to	1
the	1
Notes	1

the	1

volume	1
they	1
are	1
drawn	1
up	1
without	1
pretension	1
and	1

with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
helping	1

reader	1
Having	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
since	1
translated	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Homer	1
for	1
another	1
publisher	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
large	1
amount	1
of	1
accumulated	1
matter	1
sometimes	1
of	1
a	1
critical	1
character	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
the	1
text	1
But	1
Pope^a	1
s	1
version	1
was	1
no	1
field	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
display	1
and	1
my	1
purpose	1
was	1
to	1
touch	1
briefly	1
on	1
antiquarian	1

mythological	1
allusions	1
to	1
notice	1
occasionally	1
some	1
departures	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
few	1
parallel	1
passages	1
from	1
our	1
English	1
Homer	1
Milton	1
In	1
the	1
latter	1
task	1
I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
novelty	1

I	1
trust	1
that	1
my	1
other	1

PREFACE	1
TO	1
THE	1
ILIAD	1
OF	1
HOMER	1
Homer	1
is	1
universally	1
allowed	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
greatest	1
invention	1
of	1
any	1
writer	1
whatever	1
The	1
praise	1
of	1
judgment	1
Virgil	1
has	1
justly	1
contested	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
others	1
may	1
have	1
their	1
pretensions	1
as	1
to	1
particular	1
excellences	1
but	1
his	1
invention	1
remains	1
yet	1
unrivalled	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
poets	1
who	1
most	1
excelled	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
foundation	1
of	1
poetry	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
invention	1
that	1
in	1
different	1
degrees	1
distinguishes	1
all	1
great	1
geniuses	1
the	1
utmost	1
stretch	1
of	1
human	1
study	1
learning	1
and	1
industry	1
which	1
masters	1
everything	1
besides	1
can	1
never	1
attain	1
to	1
this	1
It	1
furnishes	1
art	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
materials	1
and	1
without	1
it	1
judgment	1
itself	1
can	1
at	1
best	1
but	1
^a	1
oesteal	1
wisely	1
^a	1
for	1
art	1
is	1
only	1
like	1
a	1
prudent	1
steward	1
that	1
lives	1
on	1
managing	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
nature	1
Whatever	1
praises	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
works	1
of	1
judgment	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
single	1
beauty	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
invention	1
must	1
not	1
contribute	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
regular	1
gardens	1
art	1
can	1
only	1
reduce	1
beauties	1
of	1
nature	1
to	1
more	1
regularity	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
figure	1
which	1
the	1
common	1
eye	1
may	1
better	1
take	1
in	1
and	1
is	1
therefore	1
more	1
entertained	1
with	1
And	1
perhaps	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
common	1
critics	1
are	1
inclined	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
judicious	1
and	1
methodical	1
genius	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
fruitful	1
one	1
is	1
because	1
they	1
find	1
it	1
easier	1
for	1
themselves	1
to	1
pursue	1
their	1
observations	1
through	1
a	1
uniform	1
and	1
bounded	1
walk	1
of	1
art	1
than	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
vast	1
and	1
various	1
extent	1
of	1
nature	1
Our	1
author^a	1
s	1
work	1
is	1
a	1
wild	1
paradise	1
where	1
if	1
we	1
cannot	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
beauties	1
so	1
distinctly	1
as	1
in	1
an	1
ordered	1
garden	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
infinitely	1
greater	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
copious	1
nursery	1
which	1
contains	1
the	1
seeds	1
and	1
first	1
productions	1
of	1
every	1
kind	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
those	1
who	1
followed	1
him	1
have	1
but	1
selected	1
some	1
particular	1
plants	1
each	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
fancy	1
to	1
cultivate	1
and	1
beautify	1
If	1
some	1
things	1
are	1
too	1
luxuriant	1
it	1
is	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
richness	1
of	1
the	1
soil	1
and	1
if	1
others	1
are	1
not	1
arrived	1
to	1
perfection	1
or	1
maturity	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
overrun	1
and	1
oppressed	1
by	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
stronger	1
nature	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
this	1
amazing	1
invention	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
attribute	1
that	1
unequalled	1
fire	1
and	1
rapture	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
forcible	1
in	1
Homer	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
true	1
poetical	1
spirit	1
is	1
master	1
of	1
himself	1
while	1
he	1
reads	1
him	1
What	1
he	1
writes	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
animated	1
nature	1
imaginable	1
every	1
thing	1
moves	1
every	1
thing	1
lives	1
and	1
is	1
put	1
in	1
action	1
If	1
a	1
council	1
be	1
called	1
or	1
a	1
battle	1
fought	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
coldly	1
informed	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
said	1
pg	1
xxxii	1
or	1
done	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
third	1
person	1
the	1
reader	1
is	1
hurried	1
out	1
of	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
poet^a	1

imagination	1
and	1
turns	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
to	1
a	1
hearer	1
in	1
another	1
to	1

spectator	1

^a	1
It	1
is	1
however	1
remarkable	1
that	1
his	1
fancy	1
which	1
is	1
everywhere	1
vigorous	1
is	1
not	1
discovered	1
immediately	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
poem	1
in	1
its	1
fullest	1
splendour	1
it	1
grows	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
both	1
upon	1
himself	1
and	1
others	1
and	1
becomes	1
on	1
fire	1

works	1
where	1
all	1
those	1
are	1
imperfect	1
or	1
neglected	1
this	1
can	1
overpower	1
criticism	1
and	1
make	1
us	1
admire	1
even	1
while	1
we	1
disapprove	1
Nay	1
where	1
this	1
appears	1
though	1
attended	1
with	1
absurdities	1
it	1
brightens	1
all	1
the	1
rubbish	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
we	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
its	1
own	1
splendour	1
This	1
fire	1
is	1
discerned	1
in	1
Virgil	1
but	1
discerned	1
as	1
through	1
a	1
glass	1
reflected	1
from	1
Homer	1
more	1
shining	1
than	1
fierce	1
but	1
everywhere	1
equal	1
and	1
constant	1
in	1
Lucan	1
and	1

it	1
bursts	1
out	1
in	1

In	1

glows	1
like	1

up	1
to	1
an	1
uncommon	1
ardour	1

in	1
him	1
only	1
it	1
burns	1
everywhere	1
clearly	1
and	1
everywhere	1
irresistibly	1
I	1
shall	1
here	1
endeavour	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
this	1
vast	1
invention	1
exerts	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
superior	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
poet	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
main	1
constituent	1
parts	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
peculiar	1
characteristic	1
which	1
distinguishes	1
him	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
authors	1
This	1
strong	1
and	1
ruling	1
faculty	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
powerful	1
star	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
its	1
course	1
drew	1
all	1
things	1
within	1
its	1
vortex	1
It	1
seemed	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
circle	1
of	1
arts	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
compass	1
of	1
nature	1
to	1
supply	1
his	1
maxims	1
and	1
reflections	1
all	1
the	1
inward	1
passions	1
and	1
affections	1
of	1
mankind	1
to	1
furnish	1
his	1
characters	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
outward	1
forms	1
and	1
images	1
of	1
things	1
for	1
his	1
descriptions	1
but	1
wanting	1
yet	1
an	1
ampler	1
sphere	1
to	1
expatiate	1
in	1
he	1
opened	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
boundless	1
walk	1
for	1
his	1
imagination	1
and	1
created	1
a	1
world	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
fable	1
That	1
which	1
Aristotle	1
calls	1
^a	1
oethe	1
soul	1
of	1
poetry	1
^a	1
was	1
first	1
breathed	1
into	1
it	1
by	1
Homer	1
I	1
shall	1
begin	1
with	1
considering	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
part	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
naturally	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
both	1
as	1
it	1
means	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
a	1
poem	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
taken	1
for	1
fiction	1
Fable	1
may	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
the	1
probable	1
the	1
allegorical	1
and	1
the	1
marvellous	1
The	1
probable	1
fable	1
is	1
the	1
recital	1
of	1
such	1
actions	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
happen	1
yet	1
might	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
course	1
of	1
nature	1
or	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
became	1
fables	1
by	1
the	1
additional	1
episodes	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
telling	1
them	1
Of	1
this	1
sort	1
is	1
the	1
main	1
story	1
of	1
an	1
epic	1
poem	1
^a	1
oeThe	1
return	1
of	1
Ulysses	1

That	1
of	1

the	1

^a	1
the	1
most	1
short	1
and	1
single	1
subject	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
chosen	1
by	1
any	1
poet	1
Yet	1
this	1
he	1
has	1
supplied	1
with	1
a	1
vaster	1
variety	1
of	1
incidents	1
pg	1
xxxiii	1
and	1

and	1
crowded	1
with	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
councils	1

and	1
episodes	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
than	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
poems	1
whose	1
schemes	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
latitude	1
and	1
irregularity	1
The	1
action	1
is	1
hurried	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
vehement	1
spirit	1
and	1
its	1
whole	1
duration	1
employs	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
fifty	1
days	1
Virgil	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
so	1
warm	1
a	1
genius	1
aided	1
himself	1
by	1
taking	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
extensive	1
subject	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
greater	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
contracting	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
both	1
Homer^a	1

poems	1
into	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
yet	1
but	1
a	1
fourth	1
part	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
his	1
The	1
other	1
epic	1
poets	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
same	1
practice	1
but	1
generally	1
carried	1
it	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
superinduce	1
a	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
fables	1
destroy	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
action	1
and	1
lose	1
their	1
readers	1
in	1
an	1
unreasonable	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
design	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
invention	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
followed	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
episode	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
story	1
If	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
a	1
regular	1
catalogue	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
they	1
all	1
draw	1
up	1
their	1
forces	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
If	1
he	1
has	1
funeral	1
games	1
for	1
Patroclus	1
Virgil	1
has	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
Anchises	1
and	1
Statius	1
rather	1
than	1
omit	1
them	1
destroys	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
Archemorus	1
If	1
Ulysses	1
visit	1
the	1
shades	1
the	1
~A	1
neas	1
of	1
Virgil	1
and	1
Scipio	1
of	1
Silius	1
are	1
sent	1
after	1
him	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
detained	1
from	1
his	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
allurements	1
of	1
Calypso	1
so	1
is	1
~A	1

by	1
Dido	1
and	1
Rinaldo	1
by	1
Armida	1
If	1
Achilles	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
a	1
quarrel	1
through	1
half	1
the	1
poem	1
Rinaldo	1
must	1
absent	1
himself	1
just	1
as	1
long	1
on	1
the	1

account	1
If	1
he	1
gives	1
his	1
hero	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
celestial	1
armour	1
Virgil	1
and	1
Tasso	1
make	1
the	1
same	1
present	1
to	1
theirs	1
Virgil	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
observed	1
this	1
close	1
imitation	1
of	1
Homer	1
but	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
supplied	1
the	1
want	1
from	1
other	1
Greek	1
authors	1
Thus	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Sinon	1
and	1
the	1
taking	1
of	1
Troy	1
was	1
copied	1
says	1
Macrobius	1
almost	1
word	1
for	1
word	1
from	1
Pisander	1
as	1
the	1
loves	1
of	1
Dido	1
and	1
~A	1
neas	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
Medea	1
and	1
Jason	1
in	1
Apollonius	1
and	1
several	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
To	1
proceed	1
to	1
the	1
allegorical	1
fable^a	1
If	1
we	1
reflect	1
upon	1
those	1
innumerable	1
knowledges	1
those	1
secrets	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
physical	1
philosophy	1
which	1
Homer	1
is	1
generally	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
allegories	1
what	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
ample	1
scene	1
of	1
wonder	1
may	1
this	1
consideration	1
afford	1
us	1
How	1
fertile	1
will	1
that	1
imagination	1
appear	1
which	1
as	1
able	1
to	1
clothe	1
all	1
the	1
properties	1
of	1
elements	1
the	1
qualifications	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
the	1
virtues	1
and	1
vices	1
in	1
forms	1
and	1
persons	1
and	1
to	1
introduce	1
them	1
into	1
actions	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
shadowed	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
field	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
succeeding	1
poets	1
could	1
dispute	1
with	1
Homer	1
and	1
whatever	1
commendations	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
them	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
for	1
their	1
invention	1
in	1
having	1
enlarged	1
his	1
circle	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
judgment	1
in	1
having	1
contracted	1
it	1
For	1
when	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
learning	1
changed	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
ages	1
and	1
science	1
was	1
delivered	1
in	1
a	1
plainer	1
manner	1
it	1
then	1
became	1
as	1
reasonable	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
modern	1
poets	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
aside	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Homer	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it	1
And	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
unhappy	1
circumstance	1
for	1
Virgil	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
time	1
that	1
demand	1
upon	1
him	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
an	1
invention	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
furnishing	1
all	1
those	1
allegorical	1
parts	1
of	1
a	1
poem	1
The	1
marvellous	1
fable	1
includes	1
whatever	1
is	1
supernatural	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
machines	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
If	1
Homer	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
introduced	1
the	1
deities	1
as	1
Herodotus	1
imagines	1
into	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
pg	1
xxxiv	1
Greece	1
he	1
seems	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
machinery	1
for	1
poetry	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
makes	1
its	1
greatest	1
importance	1
and	1
dignity	1
for	1
we	1
find	1
those	1
authors	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
offended	1
at	1
the	1
literal	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
constantly	1
laying	1
their	1
accusation	1
against	1
Homer	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
support	1
of	1
it	1
But	1
whatever	1
cause	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
his	1
machines	1
in	1
a	1
philosophical	1
or	1
religious	1
view	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
perfect	1
in	1
the	1
poetic	1
that	1
mankind	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
since	1
contented	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
none	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
enlarge	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
poetry	1
beyond	1
the	1
limits	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
every	1
attempt	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
has	1
proved	1
unsuccessful	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
changes	1
of	1
times	1
and	1
religions	1
his	1
gods	1
continue	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
poetry	1
We	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
his	1
persons	1
and	1
here	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
no	1
author	1
has	1
ever	1
drawn	1
so	1
many	1
with	1
so	1
visible	1
and	1
surprising	1
a	1
variety	1
or	1
given	1
us	1
such	1
lively	1
and	1
affecting	1
impressions	1
of	1
them	1
Every	1
one	1
has	1
something	1
so	1
singularly	1
his	1
own	1
that	1
no	1
painter	1
could	1
have	1
distinguished	1
them	1
more	1
by	1
their	1
features	1
than	1
the	1
poet	1
has	1
by	1
their	1
manners	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
exact	1
than	1
the	1
distinctions	1
he	1
has	1
observed	1
in	1
the	1
different	1
degrees	1
of	1
virtues	1
and	1
vices	1
The	1
single	1
quality	1
of	1
courage	1
is	1
wonderfully	1
diversified	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
That	1
of	1
Achilles	1
is	1
furious	1
and	1
intractable	1
that	1
of	1
Diomede	1
forward	1
yet	1
listening	1
to	1
advice	1
and	1
subject	1
to	1
command	1
that	1
of	1
Ajax	1
is	1
heavy	1
and	1
self	1
confiding	1
of	1
Hector	1
active	1
and	1
vigilant	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
Agamemnon	1
is	1
inspirited	1
by	1
love	1
of	1
empire	1
and	1
ambition	1
that	1
of	1
Menelaus	1
mixed	1
with	1
softness	1
and	1
tenderness	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
we	1
find	1
in	1
Idomeneus	1
a	1
plain	1
direct	1
soldier	1
in	1
Sarpedon	1
a	1
gallant	1
and	1
generous	1
one	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
judicious	1
and	1
astonishing	1
diversity	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
principal	1
quality	1
which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
main	1
of	1
each	1
character	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
under	1
parts	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
takes	1
care	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
tincture	1
of	1
that	1
principal	1
one	1
For	1
example	1
the	1
main	1
characters	1
of	1
Ulysses	1
and	1
Nestor	1
consist	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
distinct	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
one	1
is	1
artificial	1
and	1
various	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
natural	1
open	1
and	1
regular	1
But	1
they	1
have	1
besides	1
characters	1
of	1
courage	1
and	1
this	1
quality	1
also	1
takes	1
a	1
different	1
turn	1
in	1
each	1
from	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
his	1
prudence	1
for	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
war	1
depends	1
still	1
upon	1
caution	1
the	1
other	1
upon	1
experience	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
endless	1
to	1
produce	1
instances	1
of	1
these	1
kinds	1
The	1
characters	1
of	1
Virgil	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
striking	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
open	1
manner	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
hidden	1
and	1
undistinguished	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
marked	1
most	1
evidently	1
affect	1
us	1
not	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
Homer	1
His	1
characters	1
of	1
valour	1
are	1
much	1
alike	1
even	1
that	1
of	1
Turnus	1
seems	1
no	1
way	1
peculiar	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
superior	1
degree	1
and	1
we	1
see	1
nothing	1
that	1
differences	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
Mnestheus	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
Sergestus	1
Cloanthus	1
or	1
the	1
rest	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
remarked	1
of	1
Statius^a	1
s	1
heroes	1
that	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
impetuosity	1
runs	1
through	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
horrid	1
and	1
savage	1
courage	1
appears	1
in	1
his	1
Capaneus	1
Tydeus	1
Hippomedon	1
c	1
They	1
have	1
a	1
parity	1
of	1
character	1
which	1
makes	1
them	1
seem	1
brothers	1
of	1
one	1
family	1
I	1
believe	1
when	1
the	1
reader	1
is	1
led	1
into	1
this	1
tract	1
of	1
reflection	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
pursue	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
epic	1
and	1
tragic	1
writers	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
convinced	1
how	1
infinitely	1
superior	1
in	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
Homer	1
was	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
pg	1
xxxv	1
The	1
speeches	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
they	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
characters	1
being	1
perfect	1
or	1
defective	1
as	1
they	1
agree	1
or	1
disagree	1
with	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
utter	1
them	1
As	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
variety	1
of	1
characters	1
in	1
the	1
Iliad	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
of	1
speeches	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
poem	1
^a	1
oeEverything	1

as	1
Aristotle	1
expresses	1
it	1
that	1

everything	1

It	1
is	1
hardly	1
credible	1
in	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
such	1
length	1
how	1
small	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
lines	1
are	1
employed	1
in	1
narration	1
In	1
Virgil	1
the	1
dramatic	1
part	1
is	1
less	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
narrative	1
and	1
the	1
speeches	1
often	1
consist	1
of	1
general	1
reflections	1
or	1
thoughts	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
equally	1
just	1
in	1
any	1
person^a	1
s	1
mouth	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
occasion	1
As	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
persons	1
have	1
no	1
apparent	1
characters	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
speeches	1
escape	1
being	1
applied	1
and	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
propriety	1
We	1
oftener	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
himself	1
when	1
we	1
read	1
Virgil	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
engaged	1
in	1
Homer	1
all	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
a	1
colder	1
invention	1
that	1
interests	1
us	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
action	1
described	1
Homer	1
makes	1
us	1
hearers	1
and	1
Virgil	1
leaves	1
us	1
readers	1
If	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place	1
we	1
take	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
sentiments	1
the	1
same	1
presiding	1
faculty	1
is	1
eminent	1
in	1
the	1
sublimity	1
and	1
spirit	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
Longinus	1
has	1
given	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
Homer	1
principally	1
excelled	1
What	1
were	1
alone	1
sufficient	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
grandeur	1
and	1
excellence	1
of	1
his	1
sentiments	1
in	1
general	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
so	1
remarkable	1
a	1
parity	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Scripture	1
Duport	1
in	1
his	1
Gnomologia	1
Homerica	1
has	1
collected	1
innumerable	1
instances	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
justice	1
an	1
excellent	1
modern	1
writer	1
allows	1
that	1
if	1
Virgil	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
thoughts	1
that	1
are	1
low	1
and	1
vulgar	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
sublime	1
and	1
noble	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Roman	1
author	1
seldom	1
rises	1
into	1
very	1
astonishing	1
sentiments	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
fired	1
by	1
the	1
Iliad	1
If	1
we	1
observe	1
his	1
descriptions	1
images	1
and	1
similes	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
the	1
invention	1
still	1
predominant	1
To	1
what	1
else	1
can	1
we	1
ascribe	1
that	1
vast	1
comprehension	1
of	1
images	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
where	1
we	1
see	1
each	1
circumstance	1
of	1
art	1
and	1
individual	1
of	1
nature	1
summoned	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
fecundity	1
of	1
his	1
imagination	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
their	1
various	1
views	1
presented	1
themselves	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
had	1
their	1
impressions	1
taken	1
off	1
to	1
perfection	1
at	1
a	1
heat	1
Nay	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
gives	1
us	1
the	1
full	1
prospects	1
of	1
things	1
but	1
several	1
unexpected	1
peculiarities	1
and	1
side	1
views	1
unobserved	1
by	1
any	1
painter	1
but	1
Homer	1
Nothing	1
is	1
so	1
surprising	1
as	1
the	1
descriptions	1
of	1
his	1
battles	1
which	1
take	1
up	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
Iliad	1
and	1
are	1
supplied	1
with	1
so	1
vast	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
incidents	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
bears	1
a	1
likeness	1
to	1
another	1
such	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
deaths	1
that	1
no	1
two	1
heroes	1
are	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
profusion	1
of	1
noble	1
ideas	1
that	1
every	1
battle	1
rises	1
above	1
the	1
last	1
in	1
greatness	1
horror	1
and	1
confusion	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
near	1
that	1
number	1
of	1
images	1
and	1
descriptions	1
in	1
any	1
epic	1
poet	1
though	1
every	1
one	1
has	1
assisted	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
of	1
Virgil	1
especially	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
scarce	1
any	1
comparisons	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
drawn	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
If	1
we	1
descend	1
from	1
hence	1
to	1
the	1
expression	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
bright	1
imagination	1
of	1
Homer	1
shining	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
enlivened	1
forms	1
of	1
it	1
We	1
acknowledge	1
him	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
poetical	1
diction	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
taught	1
that	1
^a	1
oelanguage	1
of	1
the	1
gods^a	1
to	1
men	1
His	1
expression	1
is	1
like	1
pg	1
xxxvi	1
the	1
colouring	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
masters	1
which	1
discovers	1
itself	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
boldly	1
and	1
executed	1
with	1
rapidity	1
It	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
glowing	1
imaginable	1
and	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
spirit	1
Aristotle	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
poet	1
who	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
^a	1
oeliving	1
words	1
^a	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
him	1
more	1
daring	1
figures	1
and	1
metaphors	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
good	1
author	1
whatever	1
An	1
arrow	1
is	1
^a	1
oeimpatient^a	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
wing	1
a	1
weapon	1
^a	1
oethirsts^a	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
an	1
enemy	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
yet	1
his	1
expression	1
is	1
never	1
too	1
big	1
for	1
the	1
sense	1
but	1
justly	1
great	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
it	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sentiment	1
that	1
swells	1
and	1
fills	1
out	1
the	1
diction	1
which	1
rises	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
forms	1
itself	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
that	1
a	1
thought	1
is	1
warmer	1
an	1
expression	1
will	1
be	1
brighter	1
as	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
strong	1
this	1
will	1
become	1
more	1
perspicuous	1
like	1
glass	1
in	1
the	1
furnace	1
which	1
grows	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
magnitude	1
and	1
refines	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
clearness	1
only	1
as	1
the	1
breath	1
within	1
is	1
more	1
powerful	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
more	1
intense	1
To	1
throw	1
his	1
language	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
prose	1
Homer	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
affected	1
the	1
compound	1
epithets	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
composition	1
peculiarly	1
proper	1
to	1
poetry	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
it	1
heightened	1
the	1
diction	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
assisted	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
numbers	1
with	1
greater	1
sound	1
and	1
pomp	1
and	1
likewise	1
conduced	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
to	1
thicken	1
the	1
images	1
On	1
this	1
last	1
consideration	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
attribute	1
these	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
fruitfulness	1
of	1
his	1
invention	1
since	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
managed	1
them	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
supernumerary	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
or	1
things	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
We	1
see	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
Hector^a	1
s	1
plumes	1
in	1
the	1
epithet	1
Korythaiolos	1
the	1
landscape	1
of	1
Mount	1
Neritus	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Einosiphyllos	1
and	1
so	1
of	1
others	1
which	1
particular	1
images	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
insisted	1
upon	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
to	1
express	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
description	1
though	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
line	1
without	1
diverting	1
the	1
reader	1
too	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
principal	1
action	1
or	1
figure	1
As	1
a	1
metaphor	1
is	1
a	1
short	1
simile	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
epithets	1
is	1
a	1
short	1
description	1
Lastly	1
if	1
we	1
consider	1
his	1
versification	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
sensible	1
what	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
praise	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
invention	1
in	1
that	1
also	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
his	1
language	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
settled	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
Greece	1
but	1
searched	1
through	1
its	1
different	1
dialects	1
with	1
this	1
particular	1
view	1
to	1
beautify	1
and	1
perfect	1
his	1
numbers	1
he	1
considered	1
these	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
greater	1
mixture	1
of	1
vowels	1
or	1
consonants	1
and	1
accordingly	1
employed	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
verse	1
required	1
either	1
a	1
greater	1
smoothness	1
or	1
strength	1
What	1
he	1
most	1
affected	1
was	1
the	1
Ionic	1
which	1
has	1
a	1
peculiar	1
sweetness	1
from	1
its	1
never	1
using	1
contractions	1
and	1
from	1
its	1
custom	1
of	1
resolving	1
the	1
diphthongs	1
into	1
two	1
syllables	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
words	1
open	1
themselves	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
spreading	1
and	1
sonorous	1
fluency	1
With	1
this	1
he	1
mingled	1
the	1
Attic	1
contractions	1
the	1
broader	1
Doric	1
and	1
the	1
feebler	1
~A	1
olic	1
which	1
often	1
rejects	1
its	1
aspirate	1
or	1
takes	1
off	1
its	1
accent	1
and	1
completed	1
this	1
variety	1
by	1
altering	1
some	1
letters	1
with	1
the	1
licence	1
of	1
poetry	1
Thus	1
his	1
measures	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
fetters	1
to	1
his	1
sense	1
were	1
always	1
in	1
readiness	1
to	1
run	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
his	1
rapture	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
further	1
representation	1
of	1
his	1
notions	1
in	1
the	1
correspondence	1
of	1
their	1
sounds	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
signified	1
Out	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
he	1
has	1
derived	1
that	1
harmony	1
which	1
makes	1
us	1
confess	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
richest	1
head	1
but	1
the	1
finest	1
ear	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
This	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
truth	1
that	1
whoever	1
will	1
but	1
pg	1
xxxvii	1
consult	1
the	1
tune	1
of	1
his	1
verses	1
even	1
without	1
understanding	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
diligence	1
as	1
we	1
daily	1
see	1
practised	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Italian	1
operas	1
will	1
find	1
more	1
sweetness	1
variety	1
and	1
majesty	1
of	1
sound	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
language	1
of	1
poetry	1
The	1
beauty	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
is	1
allowed	1
by	1
the	1
critics	1
to	1
be	1
copied	1
but	1
faintly	1
by	1
Virgil	1
himself	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
just	1
as	1
to	1
ascribe	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
Latin	1
tongue	1
indeed	1
the	1
Greek	1
has	1
some	1
advantages	1
both	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
sound	1
of	1
its	1
words	1
and	1
the	1
turn	1
and	1
cadence	1
of	1
its	1
verse	1
which	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
language	1
Virgil	1
was	1
very	1
sensible	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
used	1
the	1
utmost	1
diligence	1
in	1
working	1
up	1
a	1
more	1
intractable	1
language	1
to	1
whatsoever	1
graces	1
it	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
line	1
to	1
a	1
beautiful	1
agreement	1
with	1
its	1
sense	1
If	1
the	1
Grecian	1
poet	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
frequently	1
celebrated	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
as	1
the	1
Roman	1
the	1
only	1
reason	1
is	1
that	1
fewer	1
critics	1
have	1
understood	1
one	1
language	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
Dionysius	1
of	1
Halicarnassus	1
has	1
pointed	1
out	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
author^a	1
s	1
beauties	1
in	1
this	1
kind	1
in	1
his	1
treatise	1
of	1
the	1
Composition	1
of	1
Words	1
It	1
suffices	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
observe	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
that	1
they	1
flow	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
imagine	1
Homer	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
care	1
than	1
to	1
transcribe	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
Muses	1
dictated	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
force	1
and	1
inspiriting	1
vigour	1
that	1
they	1
awaken	1
and	1
raise	1
us	1
like	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet	1
They	1
roll	1
along	1
as	1
a	1
plentiful	1
river	1
always	1
in	1
motion	1
and	1
always	1
full	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
a	1
tide	1
of	1
verse	1
the	1
most	1
rapid	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
most	1
smooth	1
imaginable	1
Thus	1
on	1
whatever	1
side	1
we	1
contemplate	1
Homer	1
what	1
principally	1
strikes	1
us	1
is	1
his	1
invention	1
It	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
forms	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
each	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
accordingly	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
fable	1
more	1
extensive	1
and	1
copious	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
his	1
manners	1
more	1
lively	1
and	1
strongly	1
marked	1
his	1
speeches	1
more	1
affecting	1
and	1
transported	1
his	1
sentiments	1
more	1
warm	1
and	1
sublime	1
his	1
images	1
and	1
descriptions	1
more	1
full	1
and	1
animated	1
his	1
expression	1
more	1
raised	1
and	1
daring	1
and	1
his	1
numbers	1
more	1
rapid	1
and	1
various	1
I	1
hope	1
in	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
of	1
Virgil	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
heads	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
way	1
derogated	1
from	1
his	1
character	1
Nothing	1
is	1
more	1
absurd	1
or	1
endless	1
than	1
the	1
common	1
method	1
of	1
comparing	1
eminent	1
writers	1
by	1
an	1
opposition	1
of	1
particular	1
passages	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
forming	1
a	1
judgment	1
from	1
thence	1
of	1
their	1
merit	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
character	1
and	1
distinguishing	1
excellence	1
of	1
each	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
consider	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
his	1
degree	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
admire	1
him	1
No	1
author	1
or	1
man	1
ever	1
excelled	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
faculty	1
and	1
as	1
Homer	1
has	1
done	1
this	1
in	1
invention	1
Virgil	1
has	1
in	1
judgment	1
Not	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
Homer	1
wanted	1
judgment	1
because	1
Virgil	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
eminent	1
degree	1
or	1
that	1
Virgil	1
wanted	1
invention	1
because	1
Homer	1
possessed	1
a	1
larger	1
share	1
of	1
it	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
great	1
authors	1
had	1
more	1
of	1
both	1
than	1
perhaps	1
any	1
man	1
besides	1
and	1
are	1
only	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
less	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
Homer	1
was	1
the	1
greater	1
genius	1
Virgil	1
the	1
better	1
artist	1
In	1
one	1
we	1
most	1
admire	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
work	1
Homer	1
hurries	1
and	1
transports	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
commanding	1
impetuosity	1
Virgil	1
leads	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
attractive	1
majesty	1
Homer	1
scatters	1
with	1
a	1
generous	1
profusion	1
pg	1
xxxviii	1
Virgil	1
bestows	1
with	1
a	1
careful	1
magnificence	1
Homer	1
like	1
the	1
Nile	1
pours	1
out	1
his	1
riches	1
with	1
a	1
boundless	1
overflow	1
Virgil	1
like	1
a	1
river	1
in	1
its	1
banks	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
and	1
constant	1
stream	1
When	1
we	1
behold	1
their	1
battles	1
methinks	1
the	1
two	1
poets	1
resemble	1
the	1
heroes	1
they	1
celebrate	1
Homer	1
boundless	1
and	1
resistless	1
as	1
Achilles	1
bears	1
all	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
shines	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
as	1
the	1
tumult	1
increases	1
Virgil	1
calmly	1
daring	1
like	1
~A	1
neas	1
appears	1
undisturbed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
disposes	1
all	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
conquers	1
with	1
tranquillity	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
look	1
upon	1
their	1
machines	1
Homer	1
seems	1
like	1
his	1
own	1
Jupiter	1
in	1
his	1
terrors	1
shaking	1
Olympus	1
scattering	1
the	1
lightnings	1
and	1
firing	1
the	1
heavens	1
Virgil	1
like	1
the	1
same	1
power	1
in	1
his	1
benevolence	1
counselling	1
with	1
the	1
gods	1
laying	1
plans	1
for	1
empires	1
and	1
regularly	1
ordering	1
his	1
whole	1
creation	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
great	1
parts	1
as	1
with	1
great	1
virtues	1
they	1
naturally	1
border	1
on	1
some	1
imperfection	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
hard	1
to	1
distinguish	1
exactly	1
where	1
the	1
virtue	1
ends	1
or	1
the	1
fault	1
begins	1
As	1
prudence	1
may	1
sometimes	1
sink	1
to	1
suspicion	1
so	1
may	1
a	1
great	1
judgment	1
decline	1
to	1
coldness	1
and	1
as	1
magnanimity	1
may	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
profusion	1
or	1
extravagance	1
so	1
may	1
a	1
great	1
invention	1
to	1
redundancy	1
or	1
wildness	1
If	1
we	1
look	1
upon	1
Homer	1
in	1
this	1
view	1
we	1
shall	1
perceive	1
the	1
chief	1
objections	1
against	1
him	1
to	1
proceed	1
from	1
so	1
noble	1
a	1
cause	1
as	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
this	1
faculty	1
Among	1
these	1
we	1
may	1
reckon	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
marvellous	1
fictions	1
upon	1
which	1
so	1
much	1
criticism	1
has	1
been	1
spent	1
as	1
surpassing	1
all	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
probability	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
great	1
and	1
superior	1
souls	1
as	1
with	1
gigantic	1
bodies	1
which	1
exerting	1
themselves	1
with	1
unusual	1
strength	1
exceed	1
what	1
is	1
commonly	1
thought	1
the	1
due	1
proportion	1
of	1
parts	1
to	1
become	1
miracles	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
old	1
heroes	1
of	1
that	1
make	1
commit	1
something	1
near	1
extravagance	1
amidst	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
glorious	1
and	1
inimitable	1
performances	1
Thus	1
Homer	1
has	1
his	1
^a	1
oespeaking	1
horses	1
^a	1
and	1
Virgil	1
his	1
^a	1
oemyrtles	1
distilling	1
blood	1
^a	1
where	1
the	1
latter	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
contrived	1
the	1
easy	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
deity	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
probability	1
It	1
is	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
vast	1
invention	1
that	1
his	1
similes	1
have	1
been	1
thought	1
too	1
exuberant	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
circumstances	1
The	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
faculty	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
its	1
inability	1
to	1
confine	1
itself	1
to	1
that	1
single	1
circumstance	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
comparison	1
is	1
grounded	1
it	1
runs	1
out	1
into	1
embellishments	1
of	1
additional	1
images	1
which	1
however	1
are	1
so	1
managed	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
overpower	1
the	1
main	1
one	1
His	1
similes	1
are	1
like	1
pictures	1
where	1
the	1
principal	1
figure	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
its	1
proportion	1
given	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
but	1
is	1
also	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
occasional	1
ornaments	1
and	1
prospects	1
The	1
same	1
will	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
heaping	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
comparisons	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
breath	1
when	1
his	1
fancy	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
so	1
many	1
various	1
and	1
correspondent	1
images	1
The	1
reader	1
will	1
easily	1
extend	1
this	1
observation	1
to	1
more	1
objections	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
If	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
which	1
seem	1
rather	1
to	1
charge	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
defect	1
or	1
narrowness	1
of	1
genius	1
than	1
an	1
excess	1
of	1
it	1
those	1
seeming	1
defects	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
upon	1
examination	1
to	1
proceed	1
wholly	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
Such	1
are	1
his	1
grosser	1
representations	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
and	1
the	1
vicious	1
and	1
imperfect	1
manners	1
of	1
his	1
heroes	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
here	1
pg	1
xxxix	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
point	1
generally	1
carried	1
into	1
extremes	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
censurers	1
and	1
defenders	1
of	1
Homer	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
strange	1
partiality	1
to	1
antiquity	1
to	1
think	1
with	1
Madame	1
Dacier	1
38	1
^a	1
oethat	1
those	1
times	1
and	1
manners	1
are	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
excellent	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
contrary	1
to	1
ours	1
^a	1
Who	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
prejudiced	1
in	1
their	1
favour	1
as	1
to	1
magnify	1
the	1
felicity	1
of	1
those	1
ages	1
when	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
revenge	1
and	1
cruelty	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
rapine	1
and	1
robbery	1
reigned	1
through	1
the	1
world	1
when	1
no	1
mercy	1
was	1
shown	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
lucre	1
when	1
the	1
greatest	1
princes	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
daughters	1
made	1
slaves	1
and	1
concubines	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
delicate	1
as	1
those	1
modern	1
critics	1
who	1
are	1
shocked	1
at	1
the	1
servile	1
offices	1
and	1
mean	1
employments	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
sometimes	1
see	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
Homer	1
engaged	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
taking	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
that	1
simplicity	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
luxury	1
of	1
succeeding	1
ages	1
in	1
beholding	1
monarchs	1
without	1
their	1
guards	1
princes	1
tending	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
princesses	1
drawing	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
springs	1
When	1
we	1
read	1
Homer	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
reading	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
author	1
in	1
the	1
heathen	1
world	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
consider	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
light	1
will	1
double	1
their	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
perusal	1
of	1
him	1
Let	1
them	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
growing	1
acquainted	1
with	1
nations	1
and	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
now	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
stepping	1
almost	1
three	1
thousand	1
years	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
remotest	1
antiquity	1
and	1
entertaining	1
themselves	1
with	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
surprising	1
vision	1
of	1
things	1
nowhere	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
the	1
only	1
true	1
mirror	1
of	1
that	1
ancient	1
world	1
By	1
this	1
means	1
alone	1
their	1
greatest	1
obstacles	1
will	1
vanish	1
and	1
what	1
usually	1
creates	1
their	1
dislike	1
will	1
become	1
a	1
satisfaction	1
This	1
consideration	1
may	1
further	1
serve	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
constant	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
epithets	1
to	1
his	1
gods	1
and	1
heroes	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
^a	1
oefar	1
darting	1
Phoebus	1
^a	1

Achilles	1

which	1
some	1
have	1
censured	1
as	1
impertinent	1
and	1
tediously	1
repeated	1
Those	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
powers	1
and	1
offices	1
then	1
believed	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
had	1
contracted	1
a	1
weight	1
and	1
veneration	1
from	1
the	1
rites	1
and	1
solemn	1
devotions	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
used	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
attributes	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
religion	1
to	1
salute	1
them	1
on	1
all	1
occasions	1
and	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
irreverence	1
to	1
omit	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
epithets	1
of	1
great	1
men	1
Mons	1
Boileau	1
is	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
surnames	1
and	1
repeated	1
as	1
such	1
for	1
the	1
Greeks	1
having	1
no	1
names	1
derived	1
from	1
their	1
fathers	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
add	1
some	1
other	1
distinction	1
of	1
each	1
person	1
either	1
naming	1
his	1
parents	1
expressly	1
or	1
his	1
place	1
of	1
birth	1
profession	1
or	1
the	1
like	1
as	1
Alexander	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Philip	1
Herodotus	1
of	1
Halicarnassus	1
Diogenes	1
the	1
Cynic	1
c	1
Homer	1
therefore	1
complying	1
with	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
used	1
such	1
distinctive	1
additions	1
as	1
better	1
agreed	1
with	1
poetry	1
And	1
indeed	1
we	1
have	1
something	1
parallel	1
to	1
these	1
in	1
modern	1
times	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Harold	1
Harefoot	1
Edmund	1
Ironside	1
Edward	1
Longshanks	1
Edward	1
the	1
Black	1
Prince	1
c	1
If	1
yet	1
this	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
account	1
better	1
for	1
the	1
propriety	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
repetition	1
I	1
shall	1
add	1
a	1
further	1
conjecture	1
Hesiod	1
dividing	1
the	1
world	1
into	1
its	1
different	1
ages	1
has	1
placed	1
a	1
fourth	1
age	1
between	1
the	1
brazen	1
and	1
the	1
iron	1
one	1
of	1
^a	1
oeheroes	1
distinct	1
from	1

divine	1
race	1
who	1

at	1
Thebes	1
and	1
Troy	1
are	1
called	1
demi	1

and	1

by	1
the	1
care	1

Jupiter	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
blessed	1

Now	1
among	1
the	1
divine	1
honours	1
which	1
were	1
paid	1
them	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
this	1
also	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
the	1
gods	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
without	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
an	1
epithet	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
celebrating	1
their	1
families	1
actions	1
or	1
qualities	1
What	1
other	1
cavils	1
have	1
been	1
raised	1
against	1
Homer	1
are	1
such	1
as	1
hardly	1
deserve	1
a	1
reply	1
but	1
will	1
yet	1
be	1
taken	1
notice	1
of	1
as	1
they	1
occur	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
Many	1
have	1
been	1
occasioned	1
by	1
an	1
injudicious	1
endeavour	1
to	1
exalt	1
Virgil	1
which	1
is	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
should	1
think	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
superstructure	1
by	1
undermining	1
the	1
foundation	1
one	1
would	1
imagine	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
parallels	1
that	1
these	1
critics	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
heard	1
of	1
Homer^a	1
s	1
having	1
written	1
first	1
a	1
consideration	1
which	1
whoever	1
compares	1
these	1
two	1
poets	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
always	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
Some	1
accuse	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
overlook	1
or	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
prefer	1
the	1
fable	1
and	1
moral	1
of	1
the	1
~A	1
neis	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
reasons	1
which	1
might	1
set	1
the	1
Odyssey	1
above	1
the	1
~A	1

as	1
that	1
the	1
hero	1
is	1
a	1
wiser	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
more	1
beneficial	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

else	1
they	1
blame	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
never	1
designed	1
as	1
because	1
Achilles	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
good	1
and	1
perfect	1
a	1
prince	1
as	1
~A	1
neas	1
when	1
the	1
very	1
moral	1
of	1
his	1
poem	1
required	1
a	1
contrary	1
character	1

is	1
thus	1
that	1
Rapin	1
judges	1
in	1
his	1
comparison	1
of	1
Homer	1
and	1
Virgil	1
Others	1
select	1
those	1
particular	1
passages	1
of	1
Homer	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
laboured	1
as	1
some	1
that	1
Virgil	1
drew	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
management	1
of	1
Scaliger	1
in	1
his	1
Poetics	1
Others	1
quarrel	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
take	1
for	1
low	1
and	1
mean	1
expressions	1
sometimes	1
through	1
a	1
false	1
delicacy	1
and	1
refinement	1
oftener	1
from	1
an	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
graces	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
and	1
then	1
triumph	1
in	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
translations	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
Perrault	1
in	1
his	1
Parallels	1
Lastly	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
who	1
pretending	1
to	1
a	1
fairer	1
proceeding	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
personal	1
merit	1
of	1
Homer	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
assign	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
reputation	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad	1
they	1
found	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
his	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
followed	1
and	1
in	1
pursuance	1
of	1
this	1
principle	1
they	1
make	1
those	1
accidents	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
contention	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
c	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
his	1
fame	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
reality	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
his	1
merit	1
The	1
same	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
Virgil	1
or	1
any	1
great	1
author	1
whose	1
general	1
character	1
will	1
infallibly	1
raise	1
many	1
casual	1
additions	1
to	1
their	1
reputation	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
method	1
of	1
Mons	1
de	1
la	1
Mott	1
who	1
yet	1
confesses	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
that	1
in	1
whatever	1
age	1
Homer	1
had	1
lived	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
greatest	1
poet	1
of	1
his	1
nation	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
sense	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
master	1
even	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
surpassed	1
him	1
39	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
objections	1
we	1
see	1
nothing	1
that	1
contradicts	1
his	1
title	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
invention	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
characteristic	1
of	1
poetry	1
itself	1
remains	1
unequalled	1
by	1
his	1
followers	1
he	1
still	1
continues	1
superior	1
to	1
them	1
A	1
cooler	1
judgment	1
may	1
commit	1
fewer	1
faults	1
and	1
be	1
more	1
approved	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
one	1
sort	1
of	1
critics	1
but	1
that	1
warmth	1
of	1
fancy	1
will	1
carry	1
the	1
loudest	1
and	1
most	1
pg	1
xli	1
universal	1
applauses	1
which	1
holds	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
reader	1
under	1
the	1
strongest	1
enchantment	1
Homer	1
not	1
only	1
appears	1
the	1
inventor	1
of	1
poetry	1
but	1
excels	1
all	1
the	1
inventors	1
of	1
other	1
arts	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
swallowed	1
up	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
succeeded	1
him	1
What	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
admitted	1
no	1
increase	1
it	1
only	1
left	1
room	1
for	1
contraction	1
or	1
regulation	1
He	1
showed	1
all	1
the	1
stretch	1
of	1
fancy	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
failed	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
flights	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
attempted	1
everything	1
A	1
work	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
seems	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
tree	1
which	1
rises	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
vigorous	1
seed	1
is	1
improved	1
with	1
industry	1
flourishes	1
and	1
produces	1
the	1
finest	1
fruit	1
nature	1
and	1
art	1
conspire	1
to	1
raise	1
it	1
pleasure	1
and	1
profit	1
join	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
valuable	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
find	1
the	1
justest	1
faults	1
have	1
only	1
said	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
branches	1
which	1
run	1
luxuriant	1
through	1
a	1
richness	1
of	1
nature	1
might	1
be	1
lopped	1
into	1
form	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
more	1
regular	1
appearance	1
Having	1
now	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
beauties	1
and	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
treat	1
of	1
the	1
translation	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
view	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
characteristic	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
that	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
poem	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
fable	1
manners	1
and	1
sentiments	1
no	1
translator	1
can	1
prejudice	1
it	1
but	1
by	1
wilful	1
omissions	1
or	1
contractions	1
As	1
it	1
also	1
breaks	1
out	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1
image	1
description	1
and	1
simile	1
whoever	1
lessens	1
or	1
too	1
much	1
softens	1
those	1
takes	1
off	1
from	1
this	1
chief	1
character	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
grand	1
duty	1
of	1
an	1
interpreter	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
author	1
entire	1
and	1
unmaimed	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
the	1
diction	1
and	1
versification	1
only	1
are	1
his	1
proper	1
province	1
since	1
these	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
own	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
as	1
he	1
finds	1
them	1
It	1
should	1
then	1
be	1
considered	1
what	1
methods	1
may	1
afford	1
some	1
equivalent	1
in	1
our	1
language	1
for	1
the	1
graces	1
of	1
these	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
no	1
literal	1
translation	1
can	1
be	1
just	1
to	1
an	1
excellent	1
original	1
in	1
a	1
superior	1
language	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mistake	1
to	1
imagine	1
as	1
many	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
a	1
rash	1
paraphrase	1
can	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
this	1
general	1
defect	1
which	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
by	1
deviating	1
into	1
the	1
modern	1
manners	1
of	1
expression	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
sometimes	1
a	1
darkness	1
there	1
is	1
often	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
antiquity	1
which	1
nothing	1
better	1
preserves	1
than	1
a	1
version	1
almost	1
literal	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
liberties	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
but	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
transfusing	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
and	1
supporting	1
the	1
poetical	1
style	1
of	1
the	1
translation	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
more	1
men	1
misled	1
in	1
former	1
times	1
by	1
a	1
servile	1
dull	1
adherence	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
than	1
have	1
been	1
deluded	1
in	1
ours	1
by	1
a	1
chimerical	1
insolent	1
hope	1
of	1
raising	1
and	1
improving	1
their	1
author	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
poem	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
translator	1
should	1
principally	1
regard	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
expire	1
in	1
his	1
managing	1
however	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
safest	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
preserving	1
this	1
to	1
his	1
utmost	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
without	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
finds	1
his	1
author	1
is	1
in	1
any	1
particular	1
place	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
secret	1
in	1
writing	1
to	1
know	1
when	1
to	1
be	1
plain	1
and	1
when	1
poetical	1
and	1
figurative	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
Homer	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
if	1
we	1
will	1
but	1
follow	1
modestly	1
in	1
his	1
footsteps	1
Where	1
his	1
diction	1
is	1
bold	1
and	1
lofty	1
let	1
us	1
raise	1
ours	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
but	1
where	1
his	1
is	1
plain	1
and	1
humble	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
deterred	1
from	1
imitating	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
incurring	1
the	1
censure	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
English	1
critic	1
Nothing	1
that	1
belongs	1
to	1
Homer	1
pg	1
xlii	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
commonly	1
mistaken	1
than	1
the	1
just	1
pitch	1
of	1
his	1
style	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
translators	1
having	1
swelled	1
into	1
fustian	1
in	1
a	1
proud	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
sublime	1
others	1
sunk	1
into	1
flatness	1
in	1
a	1
cold	1
and	1
timorous	1
notion	1
of	1
simplicity	1
Methinks	1
I	1
see	1
these	1
different	1
followers	1
of	1
Homer	1
some	1
sweating	1
and	1
straining	1
after	1
him	1
by	1
violent	1
leaps	1
and	1
bounds	1
the	1
certain	1
signs	1
of	1
false	1
mettle	1
others	1
slowly	1
and	1
servilely	1
creeping	1
in	1
his	1
train	1
while	1
the	1
poet	1
himself	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
proceeding	1
with	1
an	1
unaffected	1
and	1
equal	1
majesty	1
before	1
them	1
However	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
extremes	1
one	1
could	1
sooner	1
pardon	1
frenzy	1
than	1
frigidity	1
no	1
author	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
envied	1
for	1
such	1
commendations	1
as	1
he	1
may	1
gain	1
by	1
that	1
character	1
of	1
style	1
which	1
his	1
friends	1
must	1
agree	1
together	1
to	1
call	1
simplicity	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
call	1
dulness	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
graceful	1
and	1
dignified	1
simplicity	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
sordid	1
one	1
which	1
differ	1
as	1
much	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
plain	1
man	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
sloven	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
tricked	1
up	1
and	1
another	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
dressed	1
at	1
all	1
Simplicity	1
is	1
the	1
mean	1
between	1
ostentation	1
and	1
rusticity	1
This	1
pure	1
and	1
noble	1
simplicity	1
is	1
nowhere	1
in	1
such	1
perfection	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
Scripture	1
and	1
our	1
author	1
One	1
may	1
affirm	1
with	1
all	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
inspired	1
writings	1
that	1
the	1
Divine	1
Spirit	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
words	1
but	1
what	1
were	1
intelligible	1
and	1
common	1
to	1
men	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
as	1
Homer	1
is	1
the	1
author	1
nearest	1
to	1
those	1
his	1
style	1
must	1
of	1
course	1
bear	1
a	1
greater	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
sacred	1
books	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
writer	1
This	1
consideration	1
together	1
with	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
observed	1
of	1
the	1
parity	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
may	1
methinks	1
induce	1
a	1
translator	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
several	1
of	1
those	1
general	1
phrases	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
expression	1
which	1
have	1
attained	1
a	1
veneration	1
even	1
in	1
our	1
language	1
from	1
being	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
Testament	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
avoid	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
appropriated	1
to	1
the	1
Divinity	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
consigned	1
to	1
mystery	1
and	1
religion	1
For	1
a	1
further	1
preservation	1
of	1
this	1
air	1
of	1
simplicity	1
a	1
particular	1
care	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
express	1
with	1
all	1
plainness	1
those	1
moral	1
sentences	1
and	1
proverbial	1
speeches	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
numerous	1
in	1
this	1
poet	1
They	1
have	1
something	1
venerable	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
oracular	1
in	1
that	1
unadorned	1
gravity	1
and	1
shortness	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
delivered	1
a	1
grace	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
utterly	1
lost	1
by	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
a	1
more	1
ingenious	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
more	1
modern	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
paraphrase	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
mixture	1
of	1
some	1
Graecisms	1
and	1
old	1
words	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Milton	1
if	1
done	1
without	1
too	1
much	1
affectation	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
an	1
ill	1
effect	1
in	1
a	1
version	1
of	1
this	1
particular	1
work	1
which	1
most	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
a	1
venerable	1
antique	1
cast	1
But	1
certainly	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
modern	1
terms	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
government	1
such	1
as	1
^a	1
oeplatoon	1
campaign	1
junto	1
^a	1
or	1
the	1
like	1
into	1
which	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
translators	1
have	1
fallen	1
cannot	1
be	1
allowable	1
those	1
only	1
excepted	1
without	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1
subjects	1
in	1
any	1
living	1
language	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
peculiarities	1
in	1
Homer^a	1
s	1
diction	1
which	1
are	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
marks	1
or	1
moles	1
by	1
which	1
every	1
common	1
eye	1
distinguishes	1
him	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
greatest	1
admirers	1
look	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
defects	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
beauties	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
compound	1
epithets	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
repetitions	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
pg	1
xliii	1
former	1
cannot	1
be	1
done	1
literally	1
into	1
English	1
without	1
destroying	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
our	1
language	1
I	1
believe	1
such	1
should	1
be	1
retained	1
as	1
slide	1
easily	1
of	1
themselves	1
into	1
an	1
English	1
compound	1
without	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
ear	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
received	1
rules	1
of	1
composition	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
sanction	1
from	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
our	1
best	1
poets	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
familiar	1
through	1
their	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
^a	1
oethe	1

compelling	1
Jove	1
^a	1

As	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
whenever	1
any	1
can	1
be	1
as	1
fully	1
and	1
significantly	1
expressed	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
compounded	1
one	1
the	1
course	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
is	1
obvious	1
Some	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
so	1
turned	1
as	1
to	1
preserve	1
their	1
full	1
image	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
words	1
may	1
have	1
justice	1
done	1
them	1
by	1
circumlocution	1
as	1
the	1
epithet	1
einosiphyllos	1
to	1
a	1
mountain	1
would	1
appear	1
little	1
or	1
ridiculous	1
translated	1
literally	1
^a	1
oeleaf	1

Others	1
that	1
admit	1
of	1
different	1
significations	1
may	1
receive	1
an	1
advantage	1
from	1
a	1
judicious	1
variation	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
occasions	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
introduced	1

is	1
capable	1
of	1
two	1
explications	1
one	1
literal	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
the	1
darts	1
and	1
bow	1
the	1
ensigns	1
of	1
that	1
god	1
the	1
other	1
allegorical	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
therefore	1
in	1
such	1
places	1
where	1
Apollo	1
is	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
god	1
in	1
person	1
I	1
would	1
use	1
the	1
former	1
interpretation	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
are	1
described	1
I	1
would	1
make	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
avoid	1
that	1
perpetual	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
epithets	1
which	1
we	1
find	1
in	1
Homer	1
and	1
which	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
accommodated	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
those	1
times	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
to	1
ours	1
but	1
one	1
may	1
wait	1
for	1
opportunities	1
of	1
placing	1
them	1
where	1
they	1
derive	1
an	1
additional	1
beauty	1
from	1
the	1
occasions	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
employed	1
and	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
properly	1
a	1
translator	1
may	1
at	1
once	1
show	1
his	1
fancy	1
and	1
his	1
judgment	1
As	1
for	1
Homer^a	1
s	1
repetitions	1
we	1
may	1
divide	1
them	1
into	1
three	1
sorts	1
of	1
whole	1
narrations	1
and	1
speeches	1
of	1
single	1
sentences	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
verse	1
or	1
hemistitch	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
regard	1
to	1
these	1
as	1
neither	1
to	1
lose	1
so	1
known	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
offend	1
the	1
reader	1
too	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
The	1
repetition	1
is	1
not	1
ungraceful	1
in	1
those	1
speeches	1
where	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
speaker	1
renders	1
it	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
insolence	1
to	1
alter	1
his	1
words	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
messages	1
from	1
gods	1
to	1
men	1
or	1
from	1
higher	1
powers	1
to	1
inferiors	1
in	1
concerns	1
of	1
state	1
or	1
where	1
the	1
ceremonial	1
of	1
religion	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
forms	1
of	1
prayers	1
oaths	1
or	1
the	1
like	1
In	1
other	1
cases	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
best	1
rule	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
nearness	1
or	1
distance	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
repetitions	1
are	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
original	1
when	1
they	1
follow	1
too	1
close	1
one	1
may	1
vary	1
the	1
expression	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
a	1
professed	1
translator	1
be	1
authorized	1
to	1
omit	1
any	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
tedious	1
the	1
author	1
is	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
It	1
only	1
remains	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
versification	1
Homer	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
is	1
perpetually	1
applying	1
the	1
sound	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
and	1
varying	1
it	1
on	1
every	1
new	1
subject	1
This	1
is	1
indeed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
exquisite	1
beauties	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
attainable	1
by	1
very	1
few	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
of	1
Homer	1
eminent	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
and	1
Virgil	1
in	1
the	1
Latin	1
I	1
am	1
sensible	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
may	1
sometimes	1
happen	1
by	1
chance	1
when	1
a	1
writer	1
is	1
warm	1
and	1
fully	1
pg	1
xliv	1
possessed	1
of	1
his	1
image	1
however	1
it	1
may	1
reasonably	1
be	1
believed	1
they	1
designed	1
this	1
in	1
whose	1
verse	1
it	1
so	1
manifestly	1
appears	1
in	1
a	1
superior	1
degree	1
to	1
all	1
others	1
Few	1
readers	1
have	1
the	1
ear	1
to	1
be	1
judges	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
will	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
at	1
this	1
beauty	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
myself	1
utterly	1
incapable	1
of	1
doing	1
justice	1
to	1
Homer	1
I	1
attempt	1
him	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
hope	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
one	1
may	1
entertain	1
without	1
much	1
vanity	1
of	1
giving	1
a	1
more	1
tolerable	1
copy	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
any	1
entire	1
translation	1
in	1
verse	1
has	1
yet	1
done	1
We	1
have	1
only	1
those	1
of	1
Chapman	1
Hobbes	1
and	1
Ogilby	1
Chapman	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
an	1
immeasurable	1
length	1
of	1
verse	1
notwithstanding	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
scarce	1
any	1
paraphrase	1
more	1
loose	1
and	1
rambling	1
than	1
his	1
He	1
has	1
frequent	1
interpolations	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
six	1
lines	1
and	1
I	1
remember	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
Odyssey	1
ver	1
312	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
spun	1
twenty	1
verses	1
out	1
of	1
two	1
He	1
is	1
often	1
mistaken	1
in	1
so	1
bold	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
think	1
he	1
deviated	1
on	1
purpose	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
other	1
places	1
of	1
his	1
notes	1
insist	1
so	1
much	1
upon	1
verbal	1
trifles	1
He	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
strong	1
affectation	1
of	1
extracting	1
new	1
meanings	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
author	1
insomuch	1
as	1
to	1
promise	1
in	1
his	1
rhyming	1
preface	1
a	1
poem	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
he	1
had	1
revealed	1
in	1
Homer	1
and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
strain	1
the	1
obvious	1
sense	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
His	1
expression	1
is	1
involved	1
in	1
fustian	1
a	1
fault	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
remarkable	1
in	1
his	1
original	1
writings	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
tragedy	1
of	1
Bussy	1
d^a	1
Amboise	1
c	1
In	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
may	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
whole	1
performance	1
for	1
he	1
appears	1
from	1
his	1
preface	1
and	1
remarks	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
an	1
arrogant	1
turn	1
and	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
in	1
poetry	1
His	1
own	1
boast	1
of	1
having	1
finished	1
half	1
the	1
Iliad	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
fifteen	1
weeks	1
shows	1
with	1
what	1
negligence	1
his	1
version	1
was	1
performed	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
him	1
and	1
which	1
very	1
much	1
contributed	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
defects	1
is	1
a	1
daring	1
fiery	1
spirit	1
that	1
animates	1
his	1
translation	1
which	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
what	1
one	1
might	1
imagine	1
Homer	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
writ	1
before	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
years	1
of	1
discretion	1
Hobbes	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
a	1
correct	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
general	1
but	1
for	1
particulars	1
and	1
circumstances	1
he	1
continually	1
lops	1
them	1
and	1
often	1
omits	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
As	1
for	1
its	1
being	1
esteemed	1
a	1
close	1
translation	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
many	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
into	1
that	1
error	1
by	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
proceeds	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
following	1
the	1
original	1
line	1
by	1
line	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
contractions	1
above	1
mentioned	1
He	1
sometimes	1
omits	1
whole	1
similes	1
and	1
sentences	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
guilty	1
of	1
mistakes	1
into	1
which	1
no	1
writer	1
of	1
his	1
learning	1
could	1
have	1
fallen	1
but	1
through	1
carelessness	1
His	1
poetry	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Ogilby^a	1
s	1
is	1
too	1
mean	1
for	1
criticism	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
to	1
the	1
poetical	1
world	1
that	1
Mr	1
Dryden	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
translate	1
the	1
Iliad	1
He	1
has	1
left	1
us	1
only	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
in	1
which	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
not	1
truly	1
interpreted	1
the	1
sense	1
or	1
preserved	1
the	1
antiquities	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
excused	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
haste	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
regard	1
to	1
Chapman	1
whose	1
words	1
he	1
sometimes	1
copies	1
and	1
has	1
unhappily	1
followed	1
him	1
in	1
passages	1
where	1
he	1
wanders	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
However	1
had	1
he	1
translated	1
the	1
whole	1
work	1
I	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
attempted	1
Homer	1
after	1
him	1
than	1
Virgil	1
his	1
version	1
of	1
whom	1
notwithstanding	1
some	1
human	1
errors	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
noble	1
and	1
spirited	1
translation	1
I	1
know	1
in	1
any	1
language	1
But	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
great	1
geniuses	1
is	1
like	1
pg	1
xlv	1
that	1
of	1
great	1
ministers	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
confessedly	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
commonwealth	1
of	1
letters	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
envied	1
and	1
calumniated	1
only	1
for	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
it	1
That	1
which	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
endeavour	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
who	1
translates	1
Homer	1
is	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
keep	1
alive	1
that	1
spirit	1
and	1
fire	1
which	1
makes	1
his	1
chief	1
character	1
in	1
particular	1
places	1
where	1
the	1
sense	1
can	1
bear	1
any	1
doubt	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
poetical	1
as	1
most	1
agreeing	1
with	1
that	1
character	1
to	1
copy	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
variations	1
of	1
his	1
style	1
and	1
the	1
different	1
modulations	1
of	1
his	1
numbers	1
to	1
preserve	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
active	1
or	1
descriptive	1
parts	1
a	1
warmth	1
and	1
elevation	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
sedate	1
or	1
narrative	1
a	1
plainness	1
and	1
solemnity	1
in	1
the	1
speeches	1
a	1
fulness	1
and	1
perspicuity	1
in	1
the	1
sentences	1
a	1
shortness	1
and	1
gravity	1
not	1
to	1
neglect	1
even	1
the	1
little	1
figures	1
and	1
turns	1
on	1
the	1
words	1
nor	1
sometimes	1
the	1
very	1
cast	1
of	1
the	1
periods	1
neither	1
to	1
omit	1
nor	1
confound	1
any	1
rites	1
or	1
customs	1
of	1
antiquity	1
perhaps	1
too	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
include	1
the	1
whole	1
in	1
a	1
shorter	1
compass	1
than	1
has	1
hitherto	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
any	1
translator	1
who	1
has	1
tolerably	1
preserved	1
either	1
the	1
sense	1
or	1
poetry	1
What	1
I	1
would	1
further	1
recommend	1
to	1
him	1
is	1
to	1
study	1
his	1
author	1
rather	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
text	1
than	1
from	1
any	1
commentaries	1
how	1
learned	1
soever	1
or	1
whatever	1
figure	1
they	1
may	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
estimation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
consider	1
him	1
attentively	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
Virgil	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
ancients	1
and	1
with	1
Milton	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
moderns	1
Next	1
these	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
of	1
Cambray^a	1
s	1
Telemachus	1
may	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
truest	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
turn	1
of	1
our	1
author	1
and	1
Bossu^a	1
s	1
admirable	1
Treatise	1
of	1
the	1
Epic	1
Poem	1
the	1
justest	1
notion	1
of	1
his	1
design	1
and	1
conduct	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
with	1
whatever	1
judgment	1
and	1
study	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
proceed	1
or	1
with	1
whatever	1
happiness	1
he	1
may	1
perform	1
such	1
a	1
work	1
he	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
please	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
those	1
only	1
who	1
have	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
competent	1
learning	1
For	1
to	1
satisfy	1
such	1
a	1
want	1
either	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
this	1
undertaking	1
since	1
a	1
mere	1
modern	1
wit	1
can	1
like	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
modern	1
and	1
a	1
pedant	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
Greek	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
is	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
from	1
whose	1
opinions	1
I	1
am	1
prepared	1
to	1
learn	1
though	1
I	1
fear	1
no	1
judges	1
so	1
little	1
as	1
our	1
best	1
poets	1
who	1
are	1
most	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
this	1
task	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
worst	1
whatever	1
they	1
shall	1
please	1
to	1
say	1
they	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
concern	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
unhappy	1
men	1
but	1
none	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
malignant	1
writers	1
I	1
was	1
guided	1
in	1
this	1
translation	1
by	1
judgments	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
theirs	1
and	1
by	1
persons	1
for	1
whom	1
they	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
kindness	1
if	1
an	1
old	1
observation	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
strongest	1
antipathy	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
fools	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
wit	1
Mr	1
Addison	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
whose	1
advice	1
determined	1
me	1
to	1
undertake	1
this	1
task	1
who	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
me	1
upon	1
that	1
occasion	1
in	1
such	1
terms	1
as	1
I	1
cannot	1
repeat	1
without	1
vanity	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
Sir	1
Richard	1
Steele	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
recommendation	1
of	1
my	1
undertaking	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
Dr	1
Swift	1
promoted	1
my	1
interest	1
with	1
that	1
warmth	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
always	1
serves	1
his	1
friend	1
The	1
humanity	1
and	1
frankness	1
of	1
Sir	1
Samuel	1
Garth	1
are	1
what	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
wanting	1
on	1
any	1
occasion	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
acknowledge	1
with	1
infinite	1
pleasure	1
the	1
many	1
friendly	1
offices	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
sincere	1
criticisms	1
of	1
Mr	1
Congreve	1
who	1
had	1
led	1
me	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
translating	1

much	1
I	1

no	1

men	1
of	1

by	1
my	1

In	1

I	1
have	1
found	1
more	1

himself	1

have	1

the	1

has	1
been	1
shown	1
me	1
by	1
its	1
learned	1
rival	1

Oxford	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
envy	1
him	1
those	1
pompous	1
honours	1
he	1
received	1
after	1
death	1
when	1
I	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
agreeable	1
obligations	1
and	1
easy	1
friendships	1
which	1
make	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
life	1
This	1
distinction	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
shown	1
to	1
one	1

many	1
